>Every woman has a right to tell you to fuck off if you're a mysogynist.

Wow, what a revolutionary take. But, is it actually relevant to what I said? When did I ever say that women don't have the right to say fuck off?

>And even worse- an incel.

Incel is short for involuntary celibate. Incel is a derogatory term because it's often associated with misogyny, but being an incel isn't worse than being a misogynist. Incel = someone who wants to be in a romantic relationship but can't (it can be due to his attractiveness, his personal sense of confidence. but it can also be due to misogyny which shapes his view world negatively and affects potential relationships). Misogyny = plain hatred against women.
Being a misogynist is way worse than being an incel if we base ourselves on standard definition.

>Women don't need to coddle you and risk their safety just so that you can stop crying.

That's cool, when did I say they should?

>Your misery and loneliness are your own doing.

That's partially true. Lonely people sometimes become lonely due to things outside their control. But I agree with you on the importance of bearing personal responsibility for your circumstances because it can lead to positive change.

You can do your own makeup, or you can also book a more skilled makeup artist (I recommend ""feryel studio"" or ""lobna ben ammar"" if your wedding is in Tunis).
Of course you can dance and party all night long, the sitting part is really outdated and usually only done for photos and for resting between dances ! As for the witness in baladeya, it can be a woman without any problem.
I would add one advice regarding alcohol, some tunisian families consume it openly in weddings, some prefer to hide it, some forbid it completely, so you should discuss it with your fiance beforehand and inform your own family about that.",2024-01-02 17:11:43

She also said she would be in grave danger of death if she ever comes back to Tunisia. The college believed her lies without fact-checking, granted her a scholarship and posted her essay in their website as a success story. They made it look like someone escaped North Korea or smth. Soon after, many Tunisians reacted to this, including academics from Tataouine, emailed the Minneapolis college to alert them.

Some countries have poor economy like venezeulla or argentina and they have visa free to europe because of the far distance between europe and them

Also, he didn't even tell their family members where he executed them and he even refused to give their remains to their families so they could bury them with dignity. Let's not forget he made it damn sure that their families were ostracized from society and made it illegal for anyone to help them or even interact with them. Lazhar Chrayti's family members were even asked to change their names in order for them to not be persecuted by the state. 

All of this after taking advantage of the resistance fighters and their armed struggle against the French, in order for him to eventually gain power and all of this after promising them a life of dignity and comfort after the independence. A promise which he obviously chose not to honor, since he was a pathological liar, tyrant and narcissist who only cared about himself.

You heavily subsidize/cover the losses of the second business with the first business money.

 - Being close  allies to the governing power ( turks , french , bourguibist , purple diarreha and trabelsia , ennahdha …)  which general  masses perceives as a betrayal for their causes and suffering 

- being extremely corrupt and unethical ( in a corrupt country that’s almost only way to get that rich). 

- using and abusing the working class in every possible way , from the lousy salaries to the hazards and risks they put their employees on ( nse elli tatla3 fil kmayen men teli for example)


Not that i completely agree with generalizing those ideas , but one can debate that those claims have some truth into them.

I believe most people choose something less heavy than the traditional wedding dresses for the townhall ceremony. What has been popular recently are suits inspired by traditional dresses. You’ll find quite a few businesses that specialize in that if you search in FB, IG, TikTok.

Again facts don't care about your feelings , the facts are he DID commit genocide, spreading misinformation to uneducated turks and tunisians but let me correct you rq the Armenian genocide didn't start and end in 1915. Ataurk commited genocide in Cilcia in 1919, in Marash in 1920 which was accompanied by large-scale slaughtering of the Armenians, spelled the beginning of the end for the remnant Armenian population, in October 1920 against the Armenians of hajen.

When the French formally agreed to evacuate Cilicia in October 1921, the debacle signified a second deportation for the Armenians of the region. 
In the meantime, the Turkish Nationalist forces had gone to war against the Republic of Armenia.

And the list if atrocities goes on, so before you spread misinformation remember in other subs it might work but here you get fact checked sentence by sentence.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian\_genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_genocide) Armenian Genocide happened in 1915 while Atatürk was a colonel in Galippoli. Even the most severe Turkophobes that have historica knowledge don't accuse him of genocide. I sometimes feel that people are doing this intentionally. Saying Atatürk he did the genocide is like saying Merkel did the Holocaust. They were not even there during the dates.

I personally don't believe that it is our right to decide if other nations can become shit with/without somethig. I am a Turk, I respect other nations and demand such from the others. I have my own identity, so do others.

Why be a lifeless moron that literally consumes his times ""Haha! No you are nothing haha! We gave you identity! You are worthless haha admit it!""The First Turkic Khaganate was established in 6th century even before Mohammed was born.

A person with a low IQ might not be able to do certain things but that is not the same as a population with an average IQ that is lower than other populations. To prove your theory, you need to provide evidence from well-conducted epidemiological studies showing that those who are born to cousins have on average lower IQ than those who were born to non-related parent in the SAME culture and environment.

During that period, as a Tunisian living abroad, I remember going to school holding my held high and feeling so proud and exited because I came from a country with such strong national teams, both in football and handball, and I knew that all of my friends had witnessed their strength as well, and were going to talk to me about it. This was my oxygen and my cryptonite. These were the things I literally lived for. 

It began with our football team taking home the winning trophy of CAN 2004, followed by the outstanding performance of our handball team at the 2005 world cup, and then our football team qualifying for the 2006 world cup. Those really were the golden days for Tunisian sports and I have never felt nearly as proud to be a Tunisian from a sports perspective as I did back then.

If someone starts to use jargon or concepts that you dont understand  you should inform them . It is ok to not understand something, it is a sin and a huge loss of time for everyone when you pretend that you do .

Second , give a great importance to the quality of your code , writing code professionally is different then writing code for academic projects so take a minute to think about variable naming , classes and functions length and best practices in general 
Bonus : if you write  great detailed  documentation that would definitely leave a great impression

I am glad another tunisian is really feeling fed up w the whole ""A9RA ALLEMANDD"" stuff,language is culture,more than anything,you should learn a language youre culturally intresting in.As for what language I recommend,I recommend choosing based on two factors(if youre really doing this purely for fun,ofc)

First,I would recommend something you enjoy,and that has a big culture behind it,for example,espagnol has intresting lit,cinema,and internet presence,italian,russian too,japanese,chinese....you should also enjoy it,and find it beautiful.

Second,I really would recommend something excentric,why?You said you liked to learn new stuff,and the more obscure and distant is the language,the more different it is.You have to force your brain to think in new concepts,new  and it really fun if you do enjoy learning new stuff,languages with new concepts include chinese mandarin,russian,japanese.

choose based on these two criterias,my only recommendation is:self learning chinese is brutal,like borderline torture bc of the tones and script unless youre really into it,I wouldnt chose it,russian and jap are brutal but manageable,italian,swedish,spanish,are boring(imo,not an objective fact) but easy",2024-01-01 00:07:47

They know nothing about his achievements and the good he did for turkey and why turks see him as a hero and a founding father for turkey.

I read a little about Attaturk (not much but the basics  ) i know that during WWI he literally saved turkey from being split into multiple parts controlled by colonial powers, turkey was on the brink of losing its sovereignity, it was on the brink of losing Constantinople and hagia sophia but he came from a position of weakness with turkey almost losing everything, he led the armies and drove out all those who came with the goal to conquer and divide turkey. 

One other message perhaps for my fellow tunisians on why a great number of turks and attaturk hate arabs it's because they see that the arabs betrayed them and stabbed them in the back (which is true they betrayed the turks for the brits but then the arabs themselves were betrayed by the brits).

I honestly have nothing against turks.",2023-12-31 20:52:03

[https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1136&context=gc\_etds](https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1136&context=gc_etds)

Basically, on Mt Bou Qornine, a temple dated to the Roman era for Saturnus Balcaranensis was found in 1891. The assumption in 1896 was that the name implied an already existing sanctuary for Baal Hamon (Saturnus was identified with Baal Hamon by the Romans) and Balcaranensis was a Latin transcription of the Punic ""Baal Qarnaïm"" which meant ""Lord of the Horns"". The whole idea was to link Baal Hamon with the Hellenistic depictions of Zeus with two horns. The issue is there hasn't been a single depiction of Baal Hamon discovered that show him with horns. Not only that, but if we look at the name, it is ""Lord of the two horns"", not ""Lord with the two horns"", because in Punic (just like Arabic), a horn can imply an elevated area. In other words, if we assume this is a continuation of an already existing Punic sanctuary, then the inscription is dedicated to Baal Hamon, the Lord of the Two Horns (Peaks). The epithet was toponymic, not descriptive of a God

>A similar mistranslation in the case of Qarnaïm is not surprising, as it is now generally recognized that the epithet does not connote the horns which would eventually come characterize the god (after late contamination with the cult of Zeus/Jupiter Ammon), but is purely toponymic in reference, indicating the remarkable situation of the sanctuary on the taller of the twin peaks of Bu-Kournein, and not any special characteristic of the god",2023-12-31 20:44:17

Second, the RNTA is probably the absolute worst of all the cigarette companies selling in Tunisia because they're the cheapest and therefore most accessible to teens. It's not like local cigarettes are sold with parental guidance while foreign ones aren't. So this state owned benevolent tobacco company theory doesn't hold whatsoever.

I don't know what you're referring to when you say cost to be made but either way if RNTA is losing then the overall cost is more than what they should sell for because if it was a private company it would either raise prices or go bankrupt. It's a production subsidy.

Besides, even if RNTA were making money, it's still bad because the issue I'm talking about is the government encouraging cigarettes by being a player in it and also by having a conflict of interest.

The fact that the government is choosing not to sell RNTA and local cigarettes prices are set as cheap shows you that the high taxes on other types of cigarettes is basically just to get money, it's not about some kind of a vision to reduce smoking... otherwise again do the obvious and don't produce cigarettes.

My post simply asks whether the usage of UNOFFICIAL API is illegal or not. Plain and simple, if you do not know what Unofficial API is, then don't answer, here is a definition:

Unofficial APIs are **typically created by developers who want to provide access to data or functionality that is not available through an official API**. These APIs are usually reverse-engineered or developed using tools that allow the extraction of data from web pages or other software.

kg5dm4v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/q9kwim/dating/kg5dm4v/,1,"I will give you some realistic and honest advice that can help you improve your chances of meeting someone compatible. This has also helped me when I was in your shoes. 

First of all, don't despair. You are not alone in your situation. Many men struggle with finding a partner, especially in today's fast-paced and competitive world. There is nothing wrong with you, and you have plenty of time to find love. You are still young and have a lot to offer.

Second, don't limit yourself to your workplace or your immediate circle of friends. You need to expand your horizons and meet new people who share your interests and values. There are many ways to do that, such as joining online communities, taking classes, volunteering, attending events, or traveling. You can also use dating apps like Tinder, but be aware that they are not a magic solution. You still need to put effort into creating a good profile, sending engaging messages, and being respectful and honest with your matches.

Third, don't be afraid to express yourself and show your personality. You have some interesting hobbies, such as anime, reading, and coding, that can make you stand out and attract like-minded women. You don't have to pretend to be someone you are not, or hide your passions. Be confident and proud of who you are, and what you can offer. Women appreciate men who are authentic, passionate, and curious.

Fourth, don't give up on yourself or on women. You may face some rejections, disappointments, or ghosting along the way, but that's part of the dating process. Don't take it personally, or let it affect your self-esteem. Learn from your mistakes, and move on. There are many women out there who are looking for a genuine and caring partner like you. You just have to keep trying, and be patient.

Fifth, don't forget to have fun and enjoy the journey. Dating is not a chore, or a race, or a test. It's an opportunity to meet new people, learn new things, have new experiences, and grow as a person. Don't put too much pressure on yourself, or on the outcome. Focus on the present, and the connection. Be yourself, be respectful, be attentive, be playful, and be open-minded. You never know when or where you might find your girlfriend.

I hope this advice helps you.",2024-01-03 17:10:49

don't give the impression of a threat to anyone ( even other interns ) and give your colleges and supervisors the chance to shine and feels important    


in my case i was more of a self learner and didn't give much about the uni or their outdated study program . which allowed  me to have some  real experience in the field , anyways on the internship i found a lot of old and messed up code, soo i suggested  and even convinced the supervisors  of updating a part of the  old code base before adding any new feature (it wasn't easy i got into small conflicts )  


of course this affected the whole team which made me appear like some one who is trying to steal theirs job and if not am gonna make it harder because i was kinda the leader of this big change in the plan  

at the end of the internship i could see it in there eyes that they were soo happy to see me leaving

When I hear 'I thought they were against it,' I wonder, against what exactly? And who are 'they' referring to - Arabs, Muslims, North Africans?  These stores are probably family-owned and passed down through generations.  If it proves anything, it's that women don't seem hesitant to purchase lingerie in establishments run by men. 

You don't need to get upset when visiting stores run by men. It's not your problem. We don't get upset when we see that in France, for example, the law prohibiting women from wearing pants was only abolished in 2013. 

 When traveling abroad, we don't automatically assume that women lack certain rights because we don't witness them exercising those rights.   It's because you project the idea that you are at the pinnacle of women's rights, even though, for example, in terms of abortion,  we might be better than you,   with little to no debate on the subject except for discussions on social media.

If Sigma Conseil tells you that *x* percentage of people plan to vote for *y* candidate, they can't sue you for repeating and republishing that information again as if you republished a copyrighted movie. Similarly, the national meteorological institute can't sue you for saying that the temperature will be 15°C tomorrow because you can't own data.

Frist of all ! no of you or you mother have to do with his life he is an adult and he knows what the right and whats bad . I talked with my dad about it and he was crystal clear that he wanna divorce with my mom . We decided that we will the hole family about the divorce.  He just dont wanna life with her anymore. Mom accepted the divorce then life continues  . Btw know that cheating is illegal and haram but as we are grown adults he chooses with me when i found out that he will assume consequences. As i mentioned we told my mom and to bze honset she was so upset but she knows that she cant force him to stay.  Any way  after year they get a divorce and i keept a good relationship with my parents 

Tip : talk to your dad about it. And dont you ever talk your mother alone about this . You shloud talk to your dad frist then your fathers family.

No one can check that the parents are respecting that rule, and meanwhile, children are exposed to that poison, and to the risk of getting some diseases

Speaking of diseases, smoking causes a lot of those, heart, respiratory, digestive, skin, neurological, blood vessels diseases, when a smoker gets sick, he will need to be treated, most of the time, it is a lost cause, they will die anyway or live with a lot of disabilities, and the public is going to pay for that, so that's a waste of public money. I am sorry, I don't want to pay for someone's bad choices (And before you go down that road, one chooses to smoke or drink alcohol, but no one chooses to be poor or have bad luck...)

Have a study to share with us that proves that (don't share me a sensational link about an incident caused by a Tunisian immigrant, that proves nothing)? Or is it the usual information from news outlets that made you say that? What's a high-quality immigrant according to you? Enlighten us please.

All Tunisians I met (yes. ALL.) in Germany (and I met hundreds) were absolutely non-problematic at all. Most of them worked in well-known companies/institutions (VW, Continental, etc.) and even if they didn't, they were extremely non-problematic.  
These Tunisians are making an extremely important contribution to EU economy: they are young, educated, culturally close to EU and EU wasted 0 Euros on their upbringing. This is especially true since the demographics of EU aren't looking good at all.  


All it takes is just one person from MENA region to commit a crime for news outlets to go insane. If the latest incident in Prague was done by a person having an immigration background, world would've gone crazy.

These VISA restrictions existed way before the illegal migration crisis and probably proves that western countries have some sort of... how to say it... eh... hate and prejudice towards people from MENA region. (will get downvoted to hell because how dare I say this to people here)

A buyer and a seller agree on a price for a share or a commodity etc. The buyer is buying because they think the share is undervalued. The seller is selling because they think the share is at the right value or overvalued.

One of these parties is automatically wrong for this transaction. It might be the other way around for the next one. 

Institutional investors own roughly 80% of the market. They compete against each other for the best mathematicians, algorithms, computing power and networking circuits.

As far as I know, according to Islamic scholars, buying shares in other companies is halal subject to a few conditions, namely that the company should not take loans with interest (ribaa) to finance its operations or operate in non-halal areas such as non-Islamic banking and insurance.

Also if the iPhone is original, there is no Original iPhone better than another Original iPhone.

Also you should note that used iPhones are another case, there are some used iPhones which their sensors had been worn out by time making them look “worse” compared to other same models.

Finding out an iPhone is fake is very simple, a camera that does not function as expected isn’t a sign that it is fake, rather a malfunction.

And you get a job, start adding 50 or 100 dinars each month in it. on the long term, you will make profit, after 8 years, you will be exempt from all taxes on those profits. A small simulation: if you put 4000 as a start, and 100tnd every month for 8 years with a yearly performance of 5% after 8 years you end up with more than 18k TND exempt from taxes, you would have invested 14k that's a 4k profit, after 20 years that's more than 50k and you would have invested 28k.

Those are very rough numbers calculated hastily, but you should approach an insurance company and ask for details, they will present a simulation with more accurate numbers.

You should know that when you just save that money into a savings account, if the interest is lower than inflation rates, you will be losing money, while investments in markets should generate rates higher than inflation (unless there are global economic crisis, like in 2008)

You should also know that there is a risk of losing money, that's why when you invest, you diversify your placements

https://m.gsmarena.com/apple_iphone_13-review-2325p5.php 

As the opposite they were kinda a bad and blurry . Even the iphone is on warranty and ""M"" model and when i checked it it was officiall but there's are a huge difference in pictures between them . That's why in my own mind and i might be wrong the safest way is to be from a legit reseller from apple in tunisia like zoom or istore .

Don't, just don't, you're buying the phone at 2x the retail price.

The cheapest and safest way to buy an iPhone is to buy it from another country (preferably USA/Canada/UAE) by telling a friend to buy you or going by yourself. There are other ways to get it from abroad, which is via ***KNOWN*** (not retail/reseller) stores, though they do sketchy stuff to get you that iPhone (such as registering the iPhone's IMEI with someone else's passport at a price), but at the end of the day it's an actual real iPhone.

Stores that I know of are (search on insta): Best Phone, PStore+, Tokyo Store... They usually give you waranty.

If you research enough and learn how to find a counterfeit/used iPhone, you can search on Facebook marketplace / Tayara and review the iPhone for yourself, usually they claim they're new and imported.",2024-01-04 16:48:43

Why? Because people are misogynistic according to your worldview? I respect your opinion, I agree that there is a sizable percentage of people that are sexist, but your statement is just plain speculation and it has no merit. Even in this post, there are numerous posts that advised OP to tell his mother. And a lot of posts that told OP to not tell his mother have some sort of rationale behind it (his mother has mental health problems so the revelation might affect her severely. in addition to that, she'll likely get a divorce which is going to affect everyone, including OP).

But democracy is a pretty straightforward concept, all I’m saying is that the people can’t lead, they never have and never will. 

You can’t call a lemon an orange because in your opinion it’s close enough. 

No country is in reality democratic, we’re welcome to try but the result will just be a different governmental system and not actual democracy. 

Everyone loves throwing that word around in politics to get people to trust them and vote for them, that’s why the spectrum was created in the first place, to give you and many others false hope that your voice actually matters or holds any weight or that your wants and needs were carefully considered when decisions were being made.

As did Tunisia on several occasions, most of them in Bourguiba's era. He even sent thousands of unknowing innocent people to their deaths in the Battle of Bizerte just to make himself look like a war hero to Jamal Abdelnasser.

As for the crimes committed by other Arab countries, Bourguiba didn't commit them because he didn't have the army and the population that was man enough to challenge him.

I grew up in a household with a lot of fighting myself. And I can't say it didn't affect me negatively.

That's why women should be independent and have a high education, not being forced to be with men, which don't respect them.

 If you are a software engineer you should be able to make money out of thin air. 
There are thousands of niches you can get into that can make you millions of dollars as an engineer and you don't need other people to hire you to do so.

 Build your own knowledge and experience and you will get to a point where you are really good at a specific thing, then many people will want to work with you instead of being a run of the mill junior with a degree who is almost a liability rather than an asset. 

If you know two more software developers then start a company and build a product or service. Maybe you know a teacher who knows a product missing from the educational space then you help them develop it and become cofounders.

All the successful people I know in the industry have tremendous experience in a very niche area and that's how they can distinguish themselves from the millions of other developers.

Work on open source projects and find what you like to do most and what you excel at and work and money will follow. 

You can work freelance or build a company with your friends or build APIs or do hackathons or find small startups and work for free to get experience. 

The more connections you have and the more people you know the more opportunities you will have. 
Just looking for an office job will not get you anywhere even if you get the job you will make at best a slightly above average salary with no real prospects. 

Be creative. This industry is over-hyped for the average person who wants a 9-5, but if you are a creative person then you will not have any problems making money and lots of it at that. You just have to think big, learn and innovate and you will become very successful.

Trust me I know many many people in IT. From people who work in tech conglomerates to CTOs of big startups, to people who are founding their own ventures and people who are building new knowledge as academics. All of them are very successful in different ways. You just have to find something and be good at it and the money will follow.",2024-01-05 23:23:31

- If the person is really close (family), I never give it much importance. ""Hadheka had mokhou,"" so either I smile and let it be or I give a sarcastic comment that gives their fish brain a hard time.

  **Example:**
  - *Comment:* ""You look really old (dhhar 3lik lkobr).""
  - *Response:* ""I am living my life to its fullest. I have a lot going on while other people are still in the same spot they were 5 years ago (3Ayech 7yeti biltoul wbil3ardh w 3andibarcha mchaghil, mech kima barcha 3bed mazelet fi nafs lblassa).""

- If the person is a stranger, I will be as blunt as it gets (I do this especially at work).

  **Example:**
  - *Comment:* ""You gained a lot of weight.""
  - *Response:* ""It's none of your business / fuck off (oumour z*** ma3andik mamdakhlikfeha / rabbi ylahhina fi 7wayejna / ken telhit fi rou7ik khir).""",2024-01-05 18:15:46

As for the choice , I would say that your Best bet would be  in software Quality assurance ( QA testing ) as it does not require advanced technical skills and relies primarily  a Attention details and solid communication skills  .

I might have an inspiring story for you .

three years ago we had a vacancy in QA , one of the candidate was a 39  accountant who worked in ""quincaillerie"" for 12 years , and decided he has more potential  and can achieve more ,so he  quit his job and took online courses and certificates for quality assurance.

My boss and I  decided to  bet on him as he have shown a great desire and resilience  even though his english was really bad and we an english speaking company .

The guy did not disappoint , literally ""7ragha""   , he mastered every detail of his job in a couple of  months and everyone was so impressed by his work quality and his attention to every minute detail of our Softwares.

&#x200B;

After two year he  was the head of QA in our company , He did it while acquiring more certificates and working on himself even more .  He outgrew the company (salary wise) so he decided to move to a another one 

&#x200B;

last time I met him dude was making 120K in well known company and  has more certificates then his BOSS .

Dude is a legend , he inspired all of us  , I tell his story everytime I get the chance.",2024-01-05 17:57:23

Staying there is cool, getting caught being intimate is illegal.

But there is also a possibility they actually do press charges just cuz fk you ruining ur day makes their day. Usually janitor/concierge ultimately yakhra fih as long as neighbors dont hear or see shit (unless they are also cunts). As for his intentions it is the same as ur average mnayek: ""tnokh?

He either wants a piece of the cake (your cake) or ruin ur life outta jealousy. Idc what responsibilities he has, he has no business asking for ur phone number.
BUT, I dont know if ur bf being a foreigner is actually another law that idk about. So u should look deeply into that.

Tldr: keep ur wits about u, dont stay waiting near the cunt. Limit ur contact with him BUT when u do see him, act ""nicely"" dont provoke him. Look deeply into the law, either by asking an actual lawyer wala kasser rassek w googli. We all been doing this shit raho w the pigs know, as long u give them no reason to report u, u should be fine.

Tunisian father living in France here.

Kids since their first months are exposed to French at least 70% of their time, even if parents talk to them in Arabic, the first language they will pick up is French. Almost every one around them except for their parents speak french, but kids actually figure out pretty early that their parents speak a different language, and will adapt rapidly, my kid, which is starting to speak more and more uses some Arabic words exclusively with us. I always ask at the daycare and school if my kid uses some Arabic words and their answer is ""No"", actually they didn't know that my kid spoke any Arabic.

When kids grow up, some parents don't care if their kids learn how to speak Arabic properly, and it can be hard to dedicate time and money to achieve that, so they just let it go, they don't plan going back to Tunisia anyways, so why bother. Some other parents will do that effort, and will ""force"" their kids to use Arabic when family is around.

People in general, have a preferred language that they use to communicate and express themselves, if you lived all your life in France, it will be easier for you to use french, if you lived in Spain, that would be Spanish if you lived in the Egypt, that would Egyptian Arabic.

The lawyer has to do its best to get a conviction and an international arrest warrant. However, don't publish anything that might cause you problems, like his photo and say that he is the murderer, before he is officially indicted. Basically don't sabotage the procedure. You'll have to be patient.

I assume the murderer is smart enough to go to a country that will not extradite him to Tunisia like Italy or France, so you will hope that interpole will catch him if he travels.

>if you believe 80 % of humans 1000 years ago are pedos then you are insane

80%? Where did you get this number? **Stop lying to defend your religion.**

**Anyone who has had sex with a child is a fucking pedo, whether it's from 1000 years ago, 2000 years ago, or 300,000 years ago. MAN, Fuck the PDF files and their defenders.**

Tbh, this kind of nonsense, not only disgusts me, but really makes my blood boil.

Well, Aisha was a young girl. [https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5134](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5134)

[https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3324](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3324)

>It was narrated that 'Aishah said: “*My mother* was trying to ***FATTEN ME UP*** when she wanted to send me to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) (when she got married')...

&#x200B;

In case you don't believe in Sunnah:

There is not even a single verse in Quran that forbids pedophilia. **In fact, The Quran is absolutely OK with child marriage here as in this verse:**

[https://surahquran.com/aya-tafsir-4-65.html](https://surahquran.com/aya-tafsir-4-65.html)

>**وَاللَّائِي لَمْ يَحِضْنَ**

&#x200B;

So STOP trying to defend child marriage. It's really disgusting.

>if you beleive there are countless errors in Holy Quran you you are ignorant ... there is none.

Ofc, you keep lying over and over again. Like man, could you please stop?

There are many, but let me give you one example or two because I don't have all day, and I'm not here to teach you your religion.

The Quran states that humans think [from their hearts, not their brains,](https://quran.com/en/al-hajj/46) and confirms that in many verses. And that clearly contradicts science. Muhammad fell in the same scientific mistake as the people of his time, and the concept of the heart as the source of the intellect was common in that region around that time.   


Islam 100% contradicts evolution in many verses, and falls into the same mistake as other religions such as Christianity, Judaism, etc.

[https://quran.com/15?startingVerse=26](https://quran.com/15?startingVerse=26)[https://quran.com/3?startingVerse=59](https://quran.com/3?startingVerse=59)

>if you beleive something can result from nothing ..... then you do you

There are many other hypotheses out there that try to explain how the universe came into existence, **and they are more plausible than the God hypothesis.** I mean, I'm not here to teach you science either. But even if I go with you and say that ""God exists,"" I'm 100% sure he is NOT the God of Islam.",2024-01-05 12:19:09

It is illegal but no immediate action will be taken agains the API consumer, the party holding the API needs to file a lawsuit and prove the inappropriate usage of their data by the defendant, and the incurred financial damage. So if i use your API and make 1tnd on top of it, no judge will award a lawsuit over that amount, on the contrary you will be wasting the court's time and you might be pubnished for it.

I'll say about her she was a kind, smart, stubborn dumb ass ( said with love). She couldn't take what happened to her and fought for her right. She paid the ultimate price. We all told her to take the cowards way out. Get free of him and that in itself is a win. But she refused. The hand of the law was slow.

\> the claims is ridiculous it goes way back to abram in Mesopotamia

It sure is lol. Good chance he will come out Berber. Most Berber tribes like frechich and wled ayer used to claim arab lineage just for modern DNA studies to prove them wrong. Tunisia is among the most homogenous in the Mediterranean when it comes to paternal lineage. 71 percent of Tunisians come for amazigh lineages.

\> We have a lot of Arabs here especially if you're from Kairouan and the Areas where Caliphates settled

The arabs that came with caliphates are called Ashraf Arabs and there aren't quite a lot of them. Most of our arabs came either through Banu hilal immigration or later muslims running away from reconquista in Andalus.

\> Kairouen

Kairouen shows heavy berber ancestry in the city itself and arab ancestry in the villages surrounding it. I think banu hilal settled around the city.

\> not surprised that you're mostly Arab

I expected it. I come from Mthalith confederate.

\> most of us should be Phoenicians (Canaanites) and Amazigh I believe.

Most of us are Berbers and we have little to none Phoenicians ancestry. DNA studies around the mediterranean shows all the antiquity cities supposedly founded by Phoenicians in places like sicily , sardinia, spain have no Phoenicians  ancestry but rather believe or not Berber ancestry. It seems the few Phoenicians that came fisrt got absorbed and we just adopted to culture/religion. Berbers were the the later phoencians.

kgn3cci,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1908gcu/just_got_back_from_tunisia_wow/kgn3cci/,4,"I’ll give you 5 reasons:

1.	Maintaining Regional Stability: By supporting Palestine, the U.S. aims to appear as a balanced mediator in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This support is crucial for the U.S. to be able to advance its goals while the world thinks it’s looking out for peace and security for all. 

2.	International Image: the U.S. loves to don the hat of the global benefactor, a generous giant doling out aid to maintain its international image. Supporting Palestine helps the U.S. present itself as an equitable player on the world stage, concerned with human rights and resolving conflicts. It’s a form of soft power. 

3.	Counterbalancing Influence: The U.S. is well aware that a power vacuum in Palestine could invite unwelcome guests. By providing aid, the U.S. ensures that other potential influencers (think Iran, or Russia and China) don’t gain a foothold. It’s like keeping your enemies close but your frenemies closer.


4.	Leverage in Peace Talks: Financial aid gives 
the U.S. leverage in Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. It’s akin to holding the carrot in front of the horse – ensuring that you have a say in how the horse trots.

5. Domestic Politics: Never underestimate the influence of domestic politics in foreign policy decisions. Supporting Palestine can appease certain domestic political groups in the U.S., you see now how Biden is trying (and failing) to tiptoe that line between supporting Israel for his zionist voter base and supporting peace for his other, larger voter base 

Others have put it in much better terms than I have; for that I’ll implore you to check out Nye’s work on ‘complex interdependence;’ dependency theory by Andre Gunder Frank, Brzezinski’s “the grand chessboard” and “dead aid” by dambisa moyo.

kgmvigk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/18zpmob/are_jendouba_bulla_regia_el_kef_and_subaytilah/kgmvigk/,1,"depends. there are some genuinly dangerous areas. usually law enforcement will place warnings or be on guard duty and prevent you from going to said places.

in cities, the danger is that like any other city on the planet, there are unsavory people who may mug you if you go to an unpopulated area at a bad time of the day.

if you plan to go camping in the outdoors, there is the regular warning of being aware of wild animals like wolves and boars in those areas.

the real issue in my opinion as a resident of Bou Salem (a city in the governorate/state of Jendouba) is transportation. it gets a bit tricky since we mostly rely on collective taxis or whatever they are called in english (vans that transport up to 8 people), and each car has a set trajectory, will only depart with a full passenger load, and there aren't many cars or people travelling depending on the destination. public transportation is an alternative but not very reliable.

another issue you may face is the language barrier. i'll probably get some hate for this, but in general, people driving those transports aren't versed in languages, so if you don't know arabic and french, you may struggle a bit. and with how different some things operate here compared to the other countries you visited, it may be a bit confusing for a first timer.

hopefully, you'll find someone who can help for a bit until you get used to stuff.

if you have a question and need more details, feel free to dm me, and i'll try to answer to the best of my ability",2024-01-06 21:02:45

The reason for the discontinuation of the flight has to do with the limited Slots available at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport  and Tunis Air not respecting their slot times. If an airline doesn't respect their alloted slot times by having to many delays and cancellations, the Dutch Aviation authority will cancel their slots. Tunis Air could in theory request new slots (don't know if they did so or not), but there is a waiting list.

Remember back in 2021 when there were very long lines for people to get the covid vaccine, and there was an absolute fiasco with the organisation?  Our current president / national savior took over power because of that event. Not long after that people stopped wanting the vaccine altogether. You see this phenomenon in other things too like when at one time every radio station had some token foreigner as a ""chroniqueur"". I don't find any of them now. People complain that Zgougou is more expensive each year, but the lines at the Zgougou shop in rue d'Espagne are just as long each year.

This is our culture:   
أخلط لا تمنك   
We all think similarly. And I'm not saying that this is a purely Tunisian thing. It may well be a global phenomenon.

This is made worse by our successive leaders' inability, or unwillingness, to think strategically. The first president considered the country to be his own plaything, and saw himself as a genius, a nigh-sanctified being. So he tried a thing after another, including an attempt at ruling until death. The second president took the job like any other government employee would: a way to make money, further his personal objectives, and use his position to help others who can help him personally or his family.

For me personally, I would not go mountain man camping Bear Grylls style solo south of Jendouba or in Kasserine - too remote, not much to see, and a very slight possibility of accidentally running into a lunatic yahoo living off berries running away from Tunisian Military forces. ;)

It depends if u're a devout person u will find it haram but generally speaking in tunisia everyone is doing it anyway just don't do it publicly bcz it's illegal.

> Do Tunisian girls know how to kiss a boy? (after marriage) and how can I show affection to a Tunisian girl without making her uncomfortable?

Again tunisian girls are not aliens, who doesn't as human beings we know these things it's normal n natural to show affection to ur significant other, It depends if she's experienced or not ofc if she never kissed someone before it would be weird at first.

First u should make a good bond with her n know from her body language if she's into u or not if u connect well with each other then u can ask her it's simple but u should respect her if she wants to do this with u or nah.",2024-01-06 14:09:45

If you remove:

* the trip (less ~30k)

* reduce the cost of some of the house items (less ~5k, in your case all the house stuff)

* do it in a ""sala"" not a Hotel (less ~3k)

* Rent a suit instead of buying it (less ~2k)

* cheaper gold (less ~2k) though what we did was super cheap too because we didn't even want to do it, it was ""me5dha fel 5ater"" to our parents.

&nbsp;

Then you just removed 41k of what i spent, so you end up with ~25k 

I think this is the minimum average to spend. 

&nbsp;

Keep in mind that i didn't do a ""mbita/7enna"" because i dont like those either, instead I went with 17 of my friends (all boys) we rented a very big chalet somewhere outside Benzart for 3 days, and it was basically a private festival, food, alcohol, weed, music, pool, good nature, etc.. that is the ""ba3be3i"" part in the sheets lol

&nbsp;

I ended up doing the ""3ché"" though which is the equivilant of ""7enna/mbita"" but i didn't give a single Dannous there, my family covered it, i think it costed ~4k or something. 


&nbsp;

My wife also didn't do ""wteyya"", instead she just did the ""7ammem"" thingy with her friends and some family members, I think it costed ~2k. 


----

Obligatory sad-political reminder that :

25k tnd is barely 7.5K euro...

I hope this help.

First of all, that security guard needs an ass whooping for making such advancements towards you.  
Second, there's no laws preventing anybody from having anyone over at their home (I learned that after being harassed for months). The law most of us are/were paranoid about only concerns premarital intercourse and you have to actually get caught butt naked to be tried and convicted (do a quick search and read about it yourself if you want).  
Also, the police do not care about couples even if they knew you were having sex (I also learned that after months of living hell). It's too big of a hassle for nothing so they don't even bother unless there's narcotics involved or a hint of prostitution then they will start investigating.  
If you act scared, you're facilitating your own harassment. The security guard could have relationships with a few corrupt officers that he could use to harass you or your boyfriend (in my case he kept asking for money) when you guys aren't even doing anything wrong to begin with.

Obviously.

Even if you both don't know you can practise together. (After marriage obviously)

> and how can I show affection to a Tunisian girl without making her uncomfortable? 

You gotta take a decision, you said you pray in the mosque in another comment. Are you going to choose to go against God's words for your lust or someone's lust or are you going to focus on doing right?

As for the generalised idea, some do and some don't but the ones they do (basically the ones that don't care about religion and/or their family's values and just follow their lusts), do it in private. Even married couples do it in private, it's also haram to be a cuck and display your woman for others to lust over like that (just like porn basically).",2024-01-06 13:08:50

That's why I called it pseudophilosophy, we dealt with our economics the same way a redditor who comments without reading the entire post does. We never tried an entirely capitalist or an entirely communist regime.. -not that I suggest we do-
We just go after snippets and highlights, hoping our circle fits in the square. 


The problem of the government with their policies is the same as the people with their career choices.. «just try what is trending half heatedly then cry about it not working out.» 

It's an unsettling irony.

We speak Arabic at home, my daughters understand most. But can’t speak a lot really. And we’re not connected to many Tunisians where I live, so kind of on our own. If they don’t speak Arabic at home they don’t do so at all. Cuz the other Arab friends we have - non-Tunisians - speak different dialects which is a different language to our kids than the one their parents speak to them (us, parents). 

So it’s completely understandable that those 2nd or 3rd generation Tunisians who are born and raised abroad are much more comfortable discussing topics in French instead of the often very basic Arabic they only heard at home.

Maybe because this Subreddit is not the right place to ask for fatwa? Right?

&#x200B;

But anyways, let me help you with this question...

According to Islam, [it's totally halal for wife to even suck your cock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpIqzjGkmg). Since oral sex is of course halal, you can conclude that kissing would be halal as well.

Don't worry. This type of horny questions is very often asked on Islamic Fatwa websites and on Youtube.

Although, OP,  asking about islam in Tunisia's sub reddit is not the best way to do it even though you might get an answer. I recommend starting a habit of going to the mosque (if you don't do it already) and asking trusted knowledgeable imam for Islamic Knowledge.
You can also get informations from islamqa.info

To work legally, you need a legal framework:

* you can be resident in the country of your employer, and then you'll need to pay taxes in this country

* you can be solely resident in Tunisia. And in that case you need to create a company (entreprise personnelle is the simplest form) and export your services to your employer (so they will be paying you fees rather than a salary). Taxes in Tunisia are generally lower than European and American states, and you get particularly favorable treatment as a société totalement exportatrice (a good accounting firm would help you create your company and take advantage of all tax cut opportunities in Tunisia).",2024-01-06 11:10:11

kgkikgm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/18zwxzy/capitalism_hit_tunisians_as_a_pseudophilosophy/kgkikgm/,3,"Tunisia is a tutorial level country. No economic policy was implemented here with the best interest in mind. By that I mean with full consideration of the characteristics that made this land (historically) an attractive boon to conquer. It's a successive shuffling of multiple copycat economic ""reforms"" from other shitholes. Remember the communist experiment? Then we were quasi-socialist. Or not? I could chalk this up to top down buffoonery from the people warming up executive offices, but no that's not.. it? Everyone agrees that our cabinet in the 70's/80's were comprised of relatively competent people. Not competent enough to put off a bread revolution thoughever. Not competent enough to prevent the planting of the seeds that would later lead to the dismantlement of multiple native industries in favor of transitioning the economy to a pseudo-service economy. 

The most hysterical facet to observe is seeing genuienly sound policies, breed incremental dismantlement of Tunisian fabric of society. See the literacy boom of the 1960's, 70's, 80's. The ""ten7iyet le9mal"" campaign. This uncontested success of our post colonial governments, was taking a virtually agrarian, middle-ages tier society and forcefully marching them all into the 20th century. Fuck. Me. We had internet before a majority of the Latin speaking world. We had institutionalized edicts that incur beheadings in certain world regions. We had settled debates that still plague parts of the first world (eg abortion). We moonwalked into globalization ass first ready for a good decent rape. 

The result is... curiously enough, not that different from the countries we'd tried to emulate. An over-""educated"" (formally of course) populace. A saturated local market, overflooded with degrees from wherever with whatever inscription engraved on top. Did you know that 40% of tenured public sector employees got in (post 2011) with forged certificates? Of course you didn't know that because I just pulled that number out of my ass. That doesn't make that queer fact any less queer and any less true and any less sickening frankly. 

That's what makes our localized recession even more insidious. The dishonesty, slyness, corruption, not those no. Those are global vices, and they are present in most post-industrial advanced countries. It's the lawlessness. Tunisia is a lawless country. It's not a capitalist hellscape, or an immoral hovel of un-islamic practices. Tunisia is **lawless.** Tunisia is the proverbial 21st century mini-me wild west. It props up institutions under the guise of enforcing the law. But does it? It stalls. It procrastinates. It pretends to execute some form of the law. ""It"" (being the powers that be lmao) tries to straddle the middle ground so steadfastly, by placating everyone and their mother that the law becomes moot. The law is an ornament. It's the cosmetic operation with which we hope to not get clocked as a  ""pretend"" country. 

Anyways, what was the og goalpost? Oh, yeah. People are le people. They'll do anything to ensure their stability (financial, etc) and unfortunately, that could come with at the cost of some (also man made) ideals like national identity. Tunisia has been relatively inhospitable even prior to the revolution. (inb4 no life was le good. You were a kid, probably middle cl\*ss). It is what it is. People yejriw wra l5obza since circa 1970. That's why every Tunisian family had that one distant (or close) uncle who immigrated to rebuild France post ww2 in the days where the green passport was a respected nifty document. It's not ideological. It's not cultural. It's a perennial strife for survival by accumulating wealth. It's human nature.",2024-01-06 10:56:23

Super, ca me fait plaisir, je te souhaite beaucoup de courage dans ta reprise. C'est pas facile ! Perso j'apprend l'arabe littéraire actuellement. j'ai 2h de cours par semaine + duolingo, et je visite de temps en temps le site arabic toons qui a pleins de dessins animés ou ils parlent en arabe littéraire parce que c'est impossible de trouver serie ou film dans ce language. Pour ce qui est du tunisien j'ai deja une base du fait de grandir avec une mère tunisienne. La difficulté a été d'arrêter de lui répondre en français et commencer a lui repondre en tunisien, quitte a se prendre quelques petites moqueries gentilles mais découragentes de la famille qui te dit que tu parle comme un touriste. A force tu va absorber l'accent aussi. Donc c'est sur la pratique orale que je me concentre, avec ma maman et mon oncle principalement. De plus, j'ai un livre assez amusant qui s'appelle ""Parler tunisien fissa !"" qui pretend pouvoir t'apprendre le tunisien a raison de 30 mins par jour dessus, squi est une grossière exagération. Mais qui se révèle etre assez utile ! Pour ce qui est film, il y a un site qui s'appelle Artify ou tu peux louer des films tunisiens pour des prix absolument dérisoires (3e le film). GROS hic, il n'y a pas de sous titres en francais. En fait, yen a jamais. Comme les productions tunisiennes et plus largement du monde arabe ne s'exportent pas en France, tu peux rien trouver avec des sous titres francais, vu que c'est le pays exportant qui s'en charge. C'est super mega frustrant parce que je pensais aussi que passer par les films et les series pourrait m'aider a apprendre le tunisien. Les series tunisiennes sont encore moins accessibles lol. Meme des series légendaires tunisiennes comme ""choufli 7hal"" n'ont toujours pas été traduites alors qu'elles datent. Pas de chance de ce coté. Je n'ai pas exploré youtube mais tu pourrais surement y trouver des vidéos qui t'apprennent pas le tunisien en entier mais quelques expressions. Sinon, en cherchant quelque chose l'autre fois je suis tombé sur un compte tiktok qui s'apelle tkallem tounsi qui fait de courtes vidéos ou il t'apprend des mots et des expressions tunisiennes et leur prononciations. Manque de chance, tu peux pas faire pause sur tiktok ?!? Quand tu finis une vidéo ca enchaine sur une autre direct ?!? Quel enfer ! Impossible de prendre des notes. Mais si tu es un utilisateur de cette platforme ca pourrait t'interesser. Voila, j'espère avoir pu t'aider en partageant mes ressources actuelles. Il faut pratiquer pratiquer pratiquer ! Si tu a le temps je suggère aussi d'apprendre l'arabe littéraire. Je sais pas si je le conseille en meme temps car entre ca et l'argo tunisien ya un monde et tu mélange un peu tout hahah. Mais savoir parler sans écrire c'est assez embarassant. Qui plus est apprendre a lire l'arabe t'aiderait a regarder des films et series tunisiennes sous titré en arabe ce qui serait plus accessible ! Bon courage ya rhouya !",2024-01-08 00:37:43

I was born and raised in Tunisia, but I am half european. I grew up in an upper middle-class circle (relatively wealthy, but not Ferrari wealthy) in a relatively well educated and cultured environment (private schools, elite schools, private music lessons, frequent travel, etc...). So, like most people in my social circle, I went to study in Europe after finishing school (bac), and it was not that common at that time (I am quite old). For some reasons, I didn't go to France to study, but to another european country, even though I have a tight connection with France its culture.

Like most foreign students in Europe, I was mostly hanging out with other foreign students from all around the world, but most of us were pretty much from the same social class, and at that time I was not aware of that concept of ""social class"". I already knew in Tunisia that I was ""different"" and some people hated me for no apparent reason, but I never did the match.

When I went to Europe, I noticed that my middle eastern friends (turks, iranians, lebanese) never hang out with their fellow countrymen from the diaspora, even on the same campus. I didn't understand why, until I got to know a few diaspora tunisians and I made my own experience.

My experience with diaspora tunisians was also my first experience with xenophobia and racism. They assumed, that I was stupid, uneducated, and greedy, just by projecting the same characteristics of their cousins back home on me, and when they realize that I did not fit those stereotypes, they got really angry and switched to another kind of exclusion game by constantly joking about my ""exotic"" aspect. They were just constantly saying: _""tunisians suck, but we know you are not like most of them.""_ and I was really sad to see how those people who are at the very bottom of the foodchain both in Tunisia and Europe were desperately looking for somebody else to let their accumulated frustrations on.

When I talked with my turkish and iranian friends about that, they just laughed at me and told me _""you should never hang out with goat fucker kids.""_ and I sadly have to admit: they were right.

Since then, I made my opinion about working class immigrant kids, and found my peace of mind in avoiding them.",2024-01-07 23:28:26

Arab Jews have existed for a long time no one is denying that. What we are saying is that the state of Israel , the colonial Zionist state of Israel, does not have a long rich history.

Majority of the ppl of Egypt today are descendants of the people of ancient Egypt who built the pyramids and are features on the wall art. Egyptians today got hellenized during the Greco/Roman era which did not replace the Egyptian population but it did involve a lot of mixing with Greek people. That mixing still makes them the descendants of the ancient Egyptians as no one got eradicated or exterminated. Arabization did not exterminate Egyptians either. It replaced the administration language of the day which was Greek with Arabic and brought in Arab culture in the region which got indigenized over time with native traditions. Arabs never exterminated any of the original populations they arabized. So this contradicts your  statement that it is only the Coptic and Bedouins who are direct descendants.,2024-01-07 23:03:27

kgssdkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/191255d/your_view_about_tunisians_born_abroad/kgssdkl/,1,"Salut ! 

Merci pour ce long commentaire, superbement bien rédigé par ailleurs. J'aurais bien répondu en tunisien mais de un ce n'est pas forcément évident par écrit, de deux il m'est plus difficile d'utiliser le tunisien pour exprimer des pensées complexes ! 

Je comprends pour les clichés, des deux côtés. Oui, moi-même je dois bien admettre avoir des vues plutôt conservatrices et être tourné vers la spiritualité. Il faut bien comprendre que nos parents ont émigré en France il y a plusieurs décennies (les miens dans les années 70 !) en quête de perspectives économiques. Il n'y avait pas internet, whatsapp ou je ne sais quoi, ils pouvaient se sentir isolés et ont passé des moments très difficiles loin des leurs... Quand tu es isolé, tu te raccroches à ce que tu peux : l'image du pays que tu as laissé, tes croyances religieuses... c'était tout ce qu'ils avaient. Voilà donc pourquoi on est peut-être un peu plus imprégné de certaines valeurs ""d'autrefois"", nous qui avons grandi à l'étranger. 

Par conséquent il y a parfois un décalage entre les Tunisiens de l'étranger et les Tunisiens Tunisiens, c'est vrai. Mais je pense que globalement ça peut bien se passer quand chacun se respecte. Car le jugement peut venir de certains faisant la morale religieuse aux gens là-bas, je suis d'accord, mais il peut aussi être dans l'autre sens avec les locaux qui se ""moquent"" des zimigris ne boivent pas, ne sortent pas en boîte et font la prière, et qui pensent tout savoir mieux sous prétexte qu'ils ont grandi dans un pays musulman en Tunisie. Perso j'ai jamais fait la morale tant qu'on respecte mes choix personnels. 

&#x200B;

> De plus il y a l'idée que les natifs vont automatiquement essayer de profiter des leurs compatriotes en demandant argent etc sans limites. 

Moi-même je m'en veux d'avoir eu cette image pendant longtemps, surtout à cause de mauvaises expériences personnelles. Mais en même temps j'ai aussi appris à relativiser ce point, ne le prends pas mal : et si c'était vrai, serait-ce mal ? Je veux dire, beaucoup de zimigris ont pris l'habitude de flamber en Tunisie, laissant croire aux locaux qu'ils ont beaucoup de moyens même quand ce n'est pas forcément le cas. Or, un moment donné, quand on va en Tunisie il faut aussi tenir compte du contexte économique des gens et de l'image qu'on transmet, et qu'à titre personnel si je vivais en Tunisie, dans un village, et que je voyais des gens chaque été se ramener avec des vêtements  et des appareils tape à l'œil et bien j'aurais été un ""profiteur"" peut-être. 

&#x200B;

> Aussi, les tunisiens à l'étranger sont aussi pas super chauds à l'idée de se faire des potes tunisiens ailleurs car ils ont peur que ceux-ci parlent de leur modes de vies à leur famille au pays, etc. Étant moi-même tunisien en france, on s'évite de pzur de se faire juger voir de devoir rendre des comptes si on se fait balancer. Bon généralement si les deux sont sur la même longueur d'ondes l'amitié devient possible 

Je comprends mieux, d'un seul coup, ça fait sens 😆",2024-01-07 22:40:05

So yes, lot of French-Tunisian are way more fluent in french than tunisian, to say things kindly.  That being said, I absolutely don't want to blame others, but responsabilty also comes from : 

\- Parents : lot of parents of North-African ethnicity are partly french speakers. So a lot talked french to their kids instead of fully talking them into proper dialect (and arabic, more generally), like other communities do (Portuguese, Chinese...). The thing is I even see young parents nowadays, with both rencently immigrated, who still do this and don't talk tunisian to their babies. 

\- Familly : when your cousins do talk french and clearly say ""talk french, your tunisian s\*ck"" instead actually helping you improving, well you end with a very bellow average level. Not saying EVERYBODY was like this, but that was pretty common.

Alors, les relations entre ""natifs"" et ""nés à l'étranger"" (aussi appellé zmigri) est , comme tu l'as décrite, assez ""je t'aime moi non plus"".
Je vais essayer de faire un résumé concis

Les natifs perçoient les zmigris comme arrogant, hypocrites, et très jugemental. Cela vient du fait que certains zmigris ont un comportement plus que problématique une fois en tunisie, n'hésitant pas à se plaindre à tout va voir de faire des leçons de morales aux locaux, notamment sur la religion( les zmigris SONT BEAUCOUP PLUS CONSERVATEURS que les natifs) ou certains aspects. Aussi plusieurs personnes candidates à l'émigration en France ont cru avoir de la famille en france mais ce sont fait lâcher par ceux-ci une fois arrivé en france... Tu ajoutes à cela simplement le rejet de la différence des autres. Pour autant les natifs vont être très généralement accueillants et vont soutenir les tunisiens de l'étranger.

Ceux nés en France voient généralement les natifs comme arriérés, bledards, profiteurs et indigne de confiances. Il y a toujours un sentiment que les natifs sont en retard sur certains points, voir qu'ils refusent la ""civilisation"". De plus il y a l'idée que les natifs vont automatiquement essayer de profiter des leurs compatriotes en demandant argent etc sans limites. Les zmigris percoivent aussi les natifs comme impies car n'étant pas assez islamique à leur yeux

Bon, il y a tellement de clichés entre les deux populations qui n'ont pas été cités, mais c'était justz pour illustrer le fait les visions et préjugés que les uns ont sur les autres. 

Aussi, les tunisiens à l'étranger sont aussi pas super chauds à l'idée de se faire des potes tunisiens ailleurs car ils ont peur que ceux-ci parlent de leur modes de vies à leur famille au pays, etc. Étant moi-même tunisien en france, on s'évite de pzur de se faire juger voir de devoir rendre des comptes si on se fait balancer. Bon généralement si les deux sont sur la même longueur d'ondes l'amitié devient possible",2024-01-07 21:44:28

One of them is that Tunisians from France don't bother to learn tounsi.

Half of what the Hafsids controlled isn't even part of Tunisia today. Do the people of Western Libya and Eastern Algeria not also have a claim to the legacy of the Hafsids ? And technically parts of Southern Tunisia (especially around Tozeur and Kebili) weren't under their control, are they not part of your Tunisian nation then ?

If such an ""essential era of the Tunisian nation"" included people you don't deem as Tunisian and excluded people you deem as Tunisian, wouldn't you say calling it ""Tunisian"" is rather inaccurate ?

>Nation has no accurate translation to Arabic as it was newly introduced to the Arab sphere from foreign sources. Ummah is a broad term indicating a ""supranational"" society like the islamic Ummah.. we cant discuss modern concepts with irrelevant terms like Ummah.

The term Ummah has been used to mean Nation in an Arabic-speaking context for the last 200 years already. ""Al Ummah al 3arabiya"", ""Al Ummah al Masriya"", ""Al Ummah al Tunisiya"" were all terms frequently used by pan-Arabists and anti-colonial activists all through the last century and the one before it. Ummah doesn't indicate a ""supranational society"", you are referring to what is commonly referred to as ""Al Ummah"" or ""THE Ummah"" which people usually mean as ""the Islamic nation"" (with the connotation of the existence of a united Islamic sense of nationhood that transcends political borders).

Being Zionist means supporting the jewish people’s right to self determination, without which we would not exist as a people. That’s it. Not supporting Zionism means you don’t support the right of Jewish people to self determine, which would result in the genocide of our people. 

Of course - there are different sub-groups of Zionists within that umbrella term. Some of them support the settlements. I am not one of those people, nor are most of the American Zionists I know irl. 

>tunisia don’t support this and this has nothing to do with being jewish, we have one of the biggest jewish communities of the world and even a space of jewish pilgrimage located in djerba, if you go over there i bet you are going to find a lot of zionists like you, if that’s what you’re looking for.

That’s why I had two people in this thread reprimanded not by the mods of this sub - but by Reddit admins themselves - for threatening me with anti semitic Jewish stereotypes and violence?

> tunisian people are literally one of the most open minded people of the MENA 💀 

I believe you, in most regards. I’ve seen a lot of welcoming people on this sub the last few months when Reddit has for some reason been putting it in my feed five times a day. The exception to that is with regard to queer people and Jews. 

> but of course you have to take in consideration the history of the country you’re visiting. there are still people with different mindsets or homophobic people, you can’t do anything against that except doing what you gotta do with your girlfriend in private or in clubs that are lgbtq friendly. but i still think that it wont be a problem if you kiss your gf in public touristic areas, no one is gonna throw punches at you. as a queer tunisian, i can tell you myself that if i had to choose an arab country for my safety as a queer person i’d still choose tunisia

Most of that is really good to hear. Thanks for sharing your experience. 

> you literally can’t assume what people in tunisia think about queer people, just look at this sub and the number of queers/open minded ppl

I’m trying not to assume, that’s why I’m asking! So far I’ve had 2 threats, one of them was a violent threat. 

> yes you will be treated like a friend but bro this happens in most of the countries of the world💀 don’t act surprised

Unfortunately that hasn’t been my experience in most parts of the world. People *really* hate Jews. But I’m glad to hear you don’t think I would experience the same things I’ve seen on this sub irl! Perhaps Reddit just attracts extremists.",2024-01-07 19:04:56

In tunisia if parents are easy, then they are very easy, but if they're strict, then they are very very strict, you don't really find in betweens. And if you try to change a strict parent's opinion (especially dads) then you basically have no chance whatsoever. Arabic dads are strict, but Tunisian dads are something else. If you try introducing yourself you'll not only fail but probably get humiliated, and that's not because her father is a bad person but he probably just cares so much about his daughter... All Tunisians are like this. And btw if you try to introduce yourself your relationship with her is gonna basically end, he'll just prevent her from ever being able to contact you so you'll just end everything like this.  
What you can really do though is count on her, cause not only is she the only one that has any chances of convincing him but if she tells him that she wants to choose who she wanna marry then she'll probably be able to convince him. As for you though you can only convince her to convince him and try to encourage her as much as possible. That's all you can really do.  
Hopefully you reach your desired relationship though, wish you luck (;

I did leave Germany in the end (to the disapproval and disappointment of almost every person I know) and came back home. Now I feel much happier. 

Even the louage thing, something I took for granted before my stay in Germany, now has a special flavor and I savior it as well as all the other “small things” that I couldn’t find in europe. And yeah, you can never be alone in Tunisia, no one will leave you be 😄

2/ Swiping the second national language from French to English is not a solution as people don’t manage to master French already, let alone English. I am bilingual in French and English, it only brought me opportunities and an ability to speak and learn faster Latin languages such as Spanish.

3/ Liberalize law: good but it needs to be done smoothly if you don’t want social unrest.

4/ Lower taxes and cracking down on the black market: the black market is big because the government is unable to boost economic prosperity in some areas, it represents 60% of the economy given the latest figures. You need to get them into the formal economy, not cracking down on them because you can’t.

5/ Low interest mortgage: It bolsters inflation. You just can’t do something like that in Tunisia if you know basic economic playbooks. If you want to implement such measure, you need to reduce the inflation at a 2% threshold. We constantly had at least 5% inflation every year since 2017.

6/ Create a new economic capital ? Egypt has this idea and its economic return is very uncertain. We already have 3 large cities with a high amount of human capital. Let’s try to invest in the infrastructures there.

 7/ Fund new startups ? I am 100% supportive of startup nations but Tunisia cannot already manage to attract standard companies. How will you attract VCs if there is no even 24/7 electricity and water in some suburbs of Tunis, the economic capital.

8/ Create a free market economy? I am in favor and this is a very hard move politicians need to do. This will create social unrest and this is necessary in my view.

9/ People hate intellectuals in this country. We are seen as parasites working for “western” powers. For many people we embody what they hate: the upper class. Having a good situation, being happy and proactive, not setting for mediocrity is something not liked among many of our fellow citizens. That’s why this country may never see ambitious/forward-looking leaders.

1. The hammamet area is not that big, while there are taxis you can get most places by foot. If you need it though taxis are everywhere and not that expensive. If you intend on getting far from hammamet like nabeul you can take “Louage” which are privately owned collective taxis that have designated spots for every city (you can ask your taxi driver to take you to the louage station)

Most people speak french on a semi fluent level but basic English should get you what you need.

Google maps works just fine for everything except for public transport.

2. For actual Tunisian cuisine you’re better off trying it in Nabeul to immerse yourself in local culture, but then again options are available in Hammamet too.

3. The amusement parks / the medina / yasmine hammamet / the port / the old city / thats as far as my knowledge goes

4. Hammamet is very touristy, thus more on the safe side. Use common sense and you should be okay.

Some Keywords you use regarding the economy are interesting tho - and they sound very neoliberal, which i think CAN be very dangerous for a country like Tunisia.

Because while neoliberal policies may foster economic growth in some contexts, applying them indiscriminately in an undeveloped small country can lead to heigh inequality and increased economic instability. A balanced approach considering the unique challenges of the country is crucial for SUSTAINABLE economic development.

The danger lies in the potential erosion of the country's economic and political independence, as neoliberal policies may inadvertently expose it to foreign interests and control, hindering its ability to shape its own developmental trajectory.

I am against neoliberal policies. I believe the right approach is in the political center. There are sectors where liberal policies are neccecary and appropriate  - though extreme caution is necessary to protect the local economy, especially for a small country. Additionally, there are sectors and crucial assets that should be in state hands. I am aware that the government currently fails in this regard. 

The solution should be to improve and combat the corruption. While this may be more challenging than just privatization, it is undoubtedly more sustainable and in the interest of the people.",2024-01-07 17:31:54

There were a lot of kingdoms in north western Saudi arabia who were engaged with Mesopotamia & levant civilizations in trade & wars.

A lot of kingdoms in eastern Saudi Arabia that was engaged with Persia & Mesopotamia. Same with southern & central KSA.

One of my favorite experiences was when I tried to enter a mosque, actually. I was denied entry by the guard. I am not a Muslim, I understand. But, a man stood up and defended me, saying that ""all should be welcome into this place, this man should be allowed to learn our religion"" to which the guard clearly did not care. 

A few minutes later, the iman of this mosque came out and talked with me. He explained that, understandably, this is a holy mosque and that non-Muslims are not allowed inside. He then explained to me a lot about the religion, which my local friend I was traveling with translated for me for a solid 15-20 minutes. 

After that, the man who stood up for me showed us around the area - Monastir. We had tea, we explored various areas, et cetera.

kgpvmpa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/190okmf/job_offer_in_saudi_arabia/kgpvmpa/,31,"Salary is quite low.

I just left saudi arabia for good, after trying my best to find a job there. I was met with salaries like this, and i rejected them all. 

due to many reasons.

1- Job security: there is no job security in Saudi arabia specially for foreigners and Arabs specifically. Saudization laws are being struck yearly and you just have to put your hand on your heart everytime you open twitter/X when a new law is on.

\- if there is a saudi national who comes to apply to be an english teacher at your school, and sees you. the school might push you out unethically.

&#x200B;

2- Renewals: I dont think this will come as an issue during your contract, specially if they give you two years IQAMA instantly (if they give you 1 year IQAMA it might be a hassle to renew it if the school wants to let you go). 

\- If you decided to leave the school to go find another job (given that the school allows you to do that), you are looking at a very competitive market that millions of foreigners are looking for jobs, especially now with the Sudan situation and other Arab nations problems they all flooded the job market.

\- Also if your IQAMA expires, you would need to find Kafeel and everything you made or saved up during your employment will be returned back to KSA and Kafeel.

How ? 2000 transfer IQAMA fees

9800 SAR to renew the IQAMA

1000 SAR for health insurance (must and cheapest)

400\~500 SAR per month for the Kafeel.

Oh and transportation in Saudi is expensive and the public system is new and extremely unreliable.

so you would need a car which would cost you 20k upwards. and you cant own a car without saudi driving license.

and driving license would cost you from 1000 SAR to 3000 and more, including transportation back and forth.

3- Slavery: going in the Kafalah of the school or a kafeel is like marriage, if they are good then you are very very lucky and if they are bad then you will be miserable.

\- say you decided to go outside of KSA, you need to be allowed by your employer to leave in the system. you cant just get your passport and leave.

\- even if you leave saudi for good you need allowance from the employer or the Kafeel.

&#x200B;

4- diminishing economy: The economy is not what it looks like from the outside, it is actually pretty bad, and you can feel it. the people foreigners and citizens alike are not liking it here, everything is getting more expensive and the income is not changed.

&#x200B;

\- unemployment rate amongst Saudi people are high and the govt is trying to kick foreigners and replacing them with locals. so you might see locals on twitter ranting about foreigners.

&#x200B;

5- weather: the weather is extremely hot you cant imagine it until you come here. it is bad period, going to the south the weather might be better but it can get extremely cold and it sucks.

&#x200B;

Think of your end goal. You’re going to a country where you won’t save with that salary and you know a country like Saudi can never be your end game because the day your contract isn’t renewed you’re out within a week. And since your employer is your immigration sponsor you won’t be able to change a job. It’s also not a pleasant country like poor asian countries where expats spend 2 years of their lives getting paid next to nothing but at least exploring a culture and enjoying it. So ask yourself is it worth it? Hell fucking no! Tutor english in Tunisia and you’ll make much more than that.

The French got their Napoléon, the English got their Oliver Cromwell, we got out Kais Said.

It is disappointing for sure, but not totally strange. 

What we have in particular compared to the other examples I cited is the fact that our Ceasar/Emperor/Lord Protector is utterly incompetent. Like totally ill-equipped to anything related to the matters of the State. In that, I think he reflects:

* the level of understanding and clarity of the majority of the population in Tunisia.

* a mentality that is maybe a cultural specificity: we trust the incompetent more. We think that the incompetent will be unable of taking advantage of the system. Both the political spectrum and the average Tunisian trusted KS because they knew he had no experience.


So yeah, of course the Tunisian population is absolutely responsible of what is happening right now in Tunisia. But maybe the utter incompetence of our newly appointed king is a blessing in disguise: it is a bitter lesson to learn, but a useful lesson: no individual should have all the power nor be responsible of fiding the solutions of all the problems. 

I have little to no hope that the 55 years and + people in Tunisia would be able to understand this lesson, as clearly their mind is to influenced by the nostalgia towards the ""blessed Era"" of ""competent depots"" like Zaba and Bourguiba. But I do have hope for younger generations.

If my girlfriend got into an accident while in the country, would I have the same rights as a husband to visit her in the hospital? 

If the answer to any of that is that I would be treated differently if it were a queer relationship - then I wouldn’t feel comfortable in the country. 

I had to decide where to have my honeymoon based on the laws around queer people. Some international hotels wouldn’t let my ex wife and I have the honeymoon suite (for our *honeymoon*!) or were very concerned about us being visibly queer in front of children.
