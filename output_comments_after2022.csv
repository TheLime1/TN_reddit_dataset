>Every woman has a right to tell you to fuck off if you're a mysogynist.

Wow, what a revolutionary take. But, is it actually relevant to what I said? When did I ever say that women don't have the right to say fuck off?

>And even worse- an incel.

Incel is short for involuntary celibate. Incel is a derogatory term because it's often associated with misogyny, but being an incel isn't worse than being a misogynist. Incel = someone who wants to be in a romantic relationship but can't (it can be due to his attractiveness, his personal sense of confidence. but it can also be due to misogyny which shapes his view world negatively and affects potential relationships). Misogyny = plain hatred against women.
Being a misogynist is way worse than being an incel if we base ourselves on standard definition.

>Women don't need to coddle you and risk their safety just so that you can stop crying.

That's cool, when did I say they should?

>Your misery and loneliness are your own doing.

That's partially true. Lonely people sometimes become lonely due to things outside their control. But I agree with you on the importance of bearing personal responsibility for your circumstances because it can lead to positive change.

You can do your own makeup, or you can also book a more skilled makeup artist (I recommend ""feryel studio"" or ""lobna ben ammar"" if your wedding is in Tunis).
Of course you can dance and party all night long, the sitting part is really outdated and usually only done for photos and for resting between dances ! As for the witness in baladeya, it can be a woman without any problem.
I would add one advice regarding alcohol, some tunisian families consume it openly in weddings, some prefer to hide it, some forbid it completely, so you should discuss it with your fiance beforehand and inform your own family about that.",2024-01-02 17:11:43

She also said she would be in grave danger of death if she ever comes back to Tunisia. The college believed her lies without fact-checking, granted her a scholarship and posted her essay in their website as a success story. They made it look like someone escaped North Korea or smth. Soon after, many Tunisians reacted to this, including academics from Tataouine, emailed the Minneapolis college to alert them.

Some countries have poor economy like venezeulla or argentina and they have visa free to europe because of the far distance between europe and them

Also, he didn't even tell their family members where he executed them and he even refused to give their remains to their families so they could bury them with dignity. Let's not forget he made it damn sure that their families were ostracized from society and made it illegal for anyone to help them or even interact with them. Lazhar Chrayti's family members were even asked to change their names in order for them to not be persecuted by the state. 

All of this after taking advantage of the resistance fighters and their armed struggle against the French, in order for him to eventually gain power and all of this after promising them a life of dignity and comfort after the independence. A promise which he obviously chose not to honor, since he was a pathological liar, tyrant and narcissist who only cared about himself.

You heavily subsidize/cover the losses of the second business with the first business money.

 - Being close  allies to the governing power ( turks , french , bourguibist , purple diarreha and trabelsia , ennahdha …)  which general  masses perceives as a betrayal for their causes and suffering 

- being extremely corrupt and unethical ( in a corrupt country that’s almost only way to get that rich). 

- using and abusing the working class in every possible way , from the lousy salaries to the hazards and risks they put their employees on ( nse elli tatla3 fil kmayen men teli for example)


Not that i completely agree with generalizing those ideas , but one can debate that those claims have some truth into them.

I believe most people choose something less heavy than the traditional wedding dresses for the townhall ceremony. What has been popular recently are suits inspired by traditional dresses. You’ll find quite a few businesses that specialize in that if you search in FB, IG, TikTok.

Again facts don't care about your feelings , the facts are he DID commit genocide, spreading misinformation to uneducated turks and tunisians but let me correct you rq the Armenian genocide didn't start and end in 1915. Ataurk commited genocide in Cilcia in 1919, in Marash in 1920 which was accompanied by large-scale slaughtering of the Armenians, spelled the beginning of the end for the remnant Armenian population, in October 1920 against the Armenians of hajen.

When the French formally agreed to evacuate Cilicia in October 1921, the debacle signified a second deportation for the Armenians of the region. 
In the meantime, the Turkish Nationalist forces had gone to war against the Republic of Armenia.

And the list if atrocities goes on, so before you spread misinformation remember in other subs it might work but here you get fact checked sentence by sentence.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian\_genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_genocide) Armenian Genocide happened in 1915 while Atatürk was a colonel in Galippoli. Even the most severe Turkophobes that have historica knowledge don't accuse him of genocide. I sometimes feel that people are doing this intentionally. Saying Atatürk he did the genocide is like saying Merkel did the Holocaust. They were not even there during the dates.

I personally don't believe that it is our right to decide if other nations can become shit with/without somethig. I am a Turk, I respect other nations and demand such from the others. I have my own identity, so do others.

Why be a lifeless moron that literally consumes his times ""Haha! No you are nothing haha! We gave you identity! You are worthless haha admit it!""The First Turkic Khaganate was established in 6th century even before Mohammed was born.

A person with a low IQ might not be able to do certain things but that is not the same as a population with an average IQ that is lower than other populations. To prove your theory, you need to provide evidence from well-conducted epidemiological studies showing that those who are born to cousins have on average lower IQ than those who were born to non-related parent in the SAME culture and environment.

During that period, as a Tunisian living abroad, I remember going to school holding my held high and feeling so proud and exited because I came from a country with such strong national teams, both in football and handball, and I knew that all of my friends had witnessed their strength as well, and were going to talk to me about it. This was my oxygen and my cryptonite. These were the things I literally lived for. 

It began with our football team taking home the winning trophy of CAN 2004, followed by the outstanding performance of our handball team at the 2005 world cup, and then our football team qualifying for the 2006 world cup.

If someone starts to use jargon or concepts that you dont understand  you should inform them . It is ok to not understand something, it is a sin and a huge loss of time for everyone when you pretend that you do .

Second , give a great importance to the quality of your code , writing code professionally is different then writing code for academic projects so take a minute to think about variable naming , classes and functions length and best practices in general 
Bonus : if you write  great detailed  documentation that would definitely leave a great impression

I am glad another tunisian is really feeling fed up w the whole ""A9RA ALLEMANDD"" stuff,language is culture,more than anything,you should learn a language youre culturally intresting in.As for what language I recommend,I recommend choosing based on two factors(if youre really doing this purely for fun,ofc)

First,I would recommend something you enjoy,and that has a big culture behind it,for example,espagnol has intresting lit,cinema,and internet presence,italian,russian too,japanese,chinese....you should also enjoy it,and find it beautiful.

Second,I really would recommend something excentric,why?You said you liked to learn new stuff,and the more obscure and distant is the language,the more different it is.You have to force your brain to think in new concepts,new  and it really fun if you do enjoy learning new stuff,languages with new concepts include chinese mandarin,russian,japanese.

choose based on these two criterias,my only recommendation is:self learning chinese is brutal,like borderline torture bc of the tones and script unless youre really into it,I wouldnt chose it,russian and jap are brutal but manageable,italian,swedish,spanish,are boring(imo,not an objective fact) but easy",2024-01-01 00:07:47

They know nothing about his achievements and the good he did for turkey and why turks see him as a hero and a founding father for turkey.

I read a little about Attaturk (not much but the basics  ) i know that during WWI he literally saved turkey from being split into multiple parts controlled by colonial powers, turkey was on the brink of losing its sovereignity, it was on the brink of losing Constantinople and hagia sophia but he came from a position of weakness with turkey almost losing everything, he led the armies and drove out all those who came with the goal to conquer and divide turkey. 

One other message perhaps for my fellow tunisians on why a great number of turks and attaturk hate arabs it's because they see that the arabs betrayed them and stabbed them in the back (which is true they betrayed the turks for the brits but then the arabs themselves were betrayed by the brits).

I honestly have nothing against turks.",2023-12-31 20:52:03

[https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1136&context=gc\_etds](https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1136&context=gc_etds)

Basically, on Mt Bou Qornine, a temple dated to the Roman era for Saturnus Balcaranensis was found in 1891. The assumption in 1896 was that the name implied an already existing sanctuary for Baal Hamon (Saturnus was identified with Baal Hamon by the Romans) and Balcaranensis was a Latin transcription of the Punic ""Baal Qarnaïm"" which meant ""Lord of the Horns"". The whole idea was to link Baal Hamon with the Hellenistic depictions of Zeus with two horns. The issue is there hasn't been a single depiction of Baal Hamon discovered that show him with horns. Not only that, but if we look at the name, it is ""Lord of the two horns"", not ""Lord with the two horns"", because in Punic (just like Arabic), a horn can imply an elevated area. In other words, if we assume this is a continuation of an already existing Punic sanctuary, then the inscription is dedicated to Baal Hamon, the Lord of the Two Horns (Peaks). The epithet was toponymic, not descriptive of a God

>A similar mistranslation in the case of Qarnaïm is not surprising, as it is now generally recognized that the epithet does not connote the horns which would eventually come characterize the god (after late contamination with the cult of Zeus/Jupiter Ammon), but is purely toponymic in reference, indicating the remarkable situation of the sanctuary on the taller of the twin peaks of Bu-Kournein, and not any special characteristic of the god",2023-12-31 20:44:17

Second, the RNTA is probably the absolute worst of all the cigarette companies selling in Tunisia because they're the cheapest and therefore most accessible to teens. It's not like local cigarettes are sold with parental guidance while foreign ones aren't. So this state owned benevolent tobacco company theory doesn't hold whatsoever.

I don't know what you're referring to when you say cost to be made but either way if RNTA is losing then the overall cost is more than what they should sell for because if it was a private company it would either raise prices or go bankrupt. It's a production subsidy.

Besides, even if RNTA were making money, it's still bad because the issue I'm talking about is the government encouraging cigarettes by being a player in it and also by having a conflict of interest.

The fact that the government is choosing not to sell RNTA and local cigarettes prices are set as cheap shows you that the high taxes on other types of cigarettes is basically just to get money, it's not about some kind of a vision to reduce smoking... otherwise again do the obvious and don't produce cigarettes.

My post simply asks whether the usage of UNOFFICIAL API is illegal or not. Plain and simple, if you do not know what Unofficial API is, then don't answer, here is a definition:

Unofficial APIs are **typically created by developers who want to provide access to data or functionality that is not available through an official API**. These APIs are usually reverse-engineered or developed using tools that allow the extraction of data from web pages or other software.

kg5dm4v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/q9kwim/dating/kg5dm4v/,1,"I will give you some realistic and honest advice that can help you improve your chances of meeting someone compatible. This has also helped me when I was in your shoes. 

First of all, don't despair. You are not alone in your situation. Many men struggle with finding a partner, especially in today's fast-paced and competitive world. There is nothing wrong with you, and you have plenty of time to find love. You are still young and have a lot to offer.

Second, don't limit yourself to your workplace or your immediate circle of friends. You need to expand your horizons and meet new people who share your interests and values. There are many ways to do that, such as joining online communities, taking classes, volunteering, attending events, or traveling. You can also use dating apps like Tinder, but be aware that they are not a magic solution. You still need to put effort into creating a good profile, sending engaging messages, and being respectful and honest with your matches.

Third, don't be afraid to express yourself and show your personality. You have some interesting hobbies, such as anime, reading, and coding, that can make you stand out and attract like-minded women. You don't have to pretend to be someone you are not, or hide your passions. Be confident and proud of who you are, and what you can offer. Women appreciate men who are authentic, passionate, and curious.

Fourth, don't give up on yourself or on women. You may face some rejections, disappointments, or ghosting along the way, but that's part of the dating process. Don't take it personally, or let it affect your self-esteem. Learn from your mistakes, and move on. There are many women out there who are looking for a genuine and caring partner like you. You just have to keep trying, and be patient.

Fifth, don't forget to have fun and enjoy the journey. Dating is not a chore, or a race, or a test. It's an opportunity to meet new people, learn new things, have new experiences, and grow as a person. Don't put too much pressure on yourself, or on the outcome. Focus on the present, and the connection. Be yourself, be respectful, be attentive, be playful, and be open-minded. You never know when or where you might find your girlfriend.

I hope this advice helps you.",2024-01-03 17:10:49

don't give the impression of a threat to anyone ( even other interns ) and give your colleges and supervisors the chance to shine and feels important    


in my case i was more of a self learner and didn't give much about the uni or their outdated study program . which allowed  me to have some  real experience in the field , anyways on the internship i found a lot of old and messed up code, soo i suggested  and even convinced the supervisors  of updating a part of the  old code base before adding any new feature (it wasn't easy i got into small conflicts )  


of course this affected the whole team which made me appear like some one who is trying to steal theirs job and if not am gonna make it harder because i was kinda the leader of this big change in the plan  

at the end of the internship i could see it in there eyes that they were soo happy to see me leaving

When I hear 'I thought they were against it,' I wonder, against what exactly? And who are 'they' referring to - Arabs, Muslims, North Africans?  These stores are probably family-owned and passed down through generations.  If it proves anything, it's that women don't seem hesitant to purchase lingerie in establishments run by men. 

You don't need to get upset when visiting stores run by men. It's not your problem. We don't get upset when we see that in France, for example, the law prohibiting women from wearing pants was only abolished in 2013. 

 When traveling abroad, we don't automatically assume that women lack certain rights because we don't witness them exercising those rights.   It's because you project the idea that you are at the pinnacle of women's rights, even though, for example, in terms of abortion,  we might be better than you,   with little to no debate on the subject except for discussions on social media.

If Sigma Conseil tells you that *x* percentage of people plan to vote for *y* candidate, they can't sue you for repeating and republishing that information again as if you republished a copyrighted movie. Similarly, the national meteorological institute can't sue you for saying that the temperature will be 15°C tomorrow because you can't own data.

Frist of all ! no of you or you mother have to do with his life he is an adult and he knows what the right and whats bad . I talked with my dad about it and he was crystal clear that he wanna divorce with my mom . We decided that we will the hole family about the divorce.  He just dont wanna life with her anymore. Mom accepted the divorce then life continues  . Btw know that cheating is illegal and haram but as we are grown adults he chooses with me when i found out that he will assume consequences. As i mentioned we told my mom and to bze honset she was so upset but she knows that she cant force him to stay.  Any way  after year they get a divorce and i keept a good relationship with my parents 

Tip : talk to your dad about it. And dont you ever talk your mother alone about this . You shloud talk to your dad frist then your fathers family.

No one can check that the parents are respecting that rule, and meanwhile, children are exposed to that poison, and to the risk of getting some diseases

Speaking of diseases, smoking causes a lot of those, heart, respiratory, digestive, skin, neurological, blood vessels diseases, when a smoker gets sick, he will need to be treated, most of the time, it is a lost cause, they will die anyway or live with a lot of disabilities, and the public is going to pay for that, so that's a waste of public money. I am sorry, I don't want to pay for someone's bad choices (And before you go down that road, one chooses to smoke or drink alcohol, but no one chooses to be poor or have bad luck...)

Have a study to share with us that proves that (don't share me a sensational link about an incident caused by a Tunisian immigrant, that proves nothing)? Or is it the usual information from news outlets that made you say that? What's a high-quality immigrant according to you? Enlighten us please.

All Tunisians I met (yes. ALL.) in Germany (and I met hundreds) were absolutely non-problematic at all. Most of them worked in well-known companies/institutions (VW, Continental, etc.) and even if they didn't, they were extremely non-problematic.  
These Tunisians are making an extremely important contribution to EU economy: they are young, educated, culturally close to EU and EU wasted 0 Euros on their upbringing. This is especially true since the demographics of EU aren't looking good at all.  


All it takes is just one person from MENA region to commit a crime for news outlets to go insane. If the latest incident in Prague was done by a person having an immigration background, world would've gone crazy.

These VISA restrictions existed way before the illegal migration crisis and probably proves that western countries have some sort of... how to say it... eh... hate and prejudice towards people from MENA region. (will get downvoted to hell because how dare I say this to people here)

A buyer and a seller agree on a price for a share or a commodity etc. The buyer is buying because they think the share is undervalued. The seller is selling because they think the share is at the right value or overvalued.

One of these parties is automatically wrong for this transaction. It might be the other way around for the next one. 

Institutional investors own roughly 80% of the market. They compete against each other for the best mathematicians, algorithms, computing power and networking circuits.

Your question suggested that you were relatively new to this and were looking for people with more experience. I will not try to judge the quality of my experience but by quantity I would say I am fairly experienced having started investing 26 years ago.

As far as I know, according to Islamic scholars, buying shares in other companies is halal subject to a few conditions, namely that the company should not take loans with interest (ribaa) to finance its operations or operate in non-halal areas such as non-Islamic banking and insurance.

Also if the iPhone is original, there is no Original iPhone better than another Original iPhone.

Also you should note that used iPhones are another case, there are some used iPhones which their sensors had been worn out by time making them look “worse” compared to other same models.

Finding out an iPhone is fake is very simple, a camera that does not function as expected isn’t a sign that it is fake, rather a malfunction.

And you get a job, start adding 50 or 100 dinars each month in it. on the long term, you will make profit, after 8 years, you will be exempt from all taxes on those profits. A small simulation: if you put 4000 as a start, and 100tnd every month for 8 years with a yearly performance of 5% after 8 years you end up with more than 18k TND exempt from taxes, you would have invested 14k that's a 4k profit, after 20 years that's more than 50k and you would have invested 28k.

Those are very rough numbers calculated hastily, but you should approach an insurance company and ask for details, they will present a simulation with more accurate numbers.

You should know that when you just save that money into a savings account, if the interest is lower than inflation rates, you will be losing money, while investments in markets should generate rates higher than inflation (unless there are global economic crisis, like in 2008)

You should also know that there is a risk of losing money, that's why when you invest, you diversify your placements

https://m.gsmarena.com/apple_iphone_13-review-2325p5.php 

As the opposite they were kinda a bad and blurry . Even the iphone is on warranty and ""M"" model and when i checked it it was officiall but there's are a huge difference in pictures between them . That's why in my own mind and i might be wrong the safest way is to be from a legit reseller from apple in tunisia like zoom or istore .

Don't, just don't, you're buying the phone at 2x the retail price.

The cheapest and safest way to buy an iPhone is to buy it from another country (preferably USA/Canada/UAE) by telling a friend to buy you or going by yourself. There are other ways to get it from abroad, which is via ***KNOWN*** (not retail/reseller) stores, though they do sketchy stuff to get you that iPhone (such as registering the iPhone's IMEI with someone else's passport at a price), but at the end of the day it's an actual real iPhone.

Stores that I know of are (search on insta): Best Phone, PStore+, Tokyo Store... They usually give you waranty.

If you research enough and learn how to find a counterfeit/used iPhone, you can search on Facebook marketplace / Tayara and review the iPhone for yourself, usually they claim they're new and imported.",2024-01-04 16:48:43

Why? Because people are misogynistic according to your worldview? I respect your opinion, I agree that there is a sizable percentage of people that are sexist, but your statement is just plain speculation and it has no merit. Even in this post, there are numerous posts that advised OP to tell his mother. And a lot of posts that told OP to not tell his mother have some sort of rationale behind it (his mother has mental health problems so the revelation might affect her severely. in addition to that, she'll likely get a divorce which is going to affect everyone, including OP).

But democracy is a pretty straightforward concept, all I’m saying is that the people can’t lead, they never have and never will. 

You can’t call a lemon an orange because in your opinion it’s close enough. 

No country is in reality democratic, we’re welcome to try but the result will just be a different governmental system and not actual democracy. 

Everyone loves throwing that word around in politics to get people to trust them and vote for them, that’s why the spectrum was created in the first place, to give you and many others false hope that your voice actually matters or holds any weight or that your wants and needs were carefully considered when decisions were being made.

As did Tunisia on several occasions, most of them in Bourguiba's era. He even sent thousands of unknowing innocent people to their deaths in the Battle of Bizerte just to make himself look like a war hero to Jamal Abdelnasser.

As for the crimes committed by other Arab countries, Bourguiba didn't commit them because he didn't have the army and the population that was man enough to challenge him.

I grew up in a household with a lot of fighting myself. And I can't say it didn't affect me negatively.

That's why women should be independent and have a high education, not being forced to be with men, which don't respect them.

 If you are a software engineer you should be able to make money out of thin air. 
There are thousands of niches you can get into that can make you millions of dollars as an engineer and you don't need other people to hire you to do so.

 Build your own knowledge and experience and you will get to a point where you are really good at a specific thing, then many people will want to work with you instead of being a run of the mill junior with a degree who is almost a liability rather than an asset. 

If you know two more software developers then start a company and build a product or service. Maybe you know a teacher who knows a product missing from the educational space then you help them develop it and become cofounders.

All the successful people I know in the industry have tremendous experience in a very niche area and that's how they can distinguish themselves from the millions of other developers.

Work on open source projects and find what you like to do most and what you excel at and work and money will follow. 

You can work freelance or build a company with your friends or build APIs or do hackathons or find small startups and work for free to get experience. 

The more connections you have and the more people you know the more opportunities you will have. 
Just looking for an office job will not get you anywhere even if you get the job you will make at best a slightly above average salary with no real prospects. 

Be creative. This industry is over-hyped for the average person who wants a 9-5, but if you are a creative person then you will not have any problems making money and lots of it at that. You just have to think big, learn and innovate and you will become very successful.

Trust me I know many many people in IT. From people who work in tech conglomerates to CTOs of big startups, to people who are founding their own ventures and people who are building new knowledge as academics. All of them are very successful in different ways. You just have to find something and be good at it and the money will follow.",2024-01-05 23:23:31

- If the person is really close (family), I never give it much importance. ""Hadheka had mokhou,"" so either I smile and let it be or I give a sarcastic comment that gives their fish brain a hard time.

  **Example:**
  - *Comment:* ""You look really old (dhhar 3lik lkobr).""
  - *Response:* ""I am living my life to its fullest. I have a lot going on while other people are still in the same spot they were 5 years ago (3Ayech 7yeti biltoul wbil3ardh w 3andibarcha mchaghil, mech kima barcha 3bed mazelet fi nafs lblassa).""

- If the person is a stranger, I will be as blunt as it gets (I do this especially at work).

  **Example:**
  - *Comment:* ""You gained a lot of weight.""
  - *Response:* ""It's none of your business / fuck off (oumour z*** ma3andik mamdakhlikfeha / rabbi ylahhina fi 7wayejna / ken telhit fi rou7ik khir).""",2024-01-05 18:15:46

As for the choice , I would say that your Best bet would be  in software Quality assurance ( QA testing ) as it does not require advanced technical skills and relies primarily  a Attention details and solid communication skills  .

I might have an inspiring story for you .

three years ago we had a vacancy in QA , one of the candidate was a 39  accountant who worked in ""quincaillerie"" for 12 years , and decided he has more potential  and can achieve more ,so he  quit his job and took online courses and certificates for quality assurance.

My boss and I  decided to  bet on him as he have shown a great desire and resilience  even though his english was really bad and we an english speaking company .

The guy did not disappoint , literally ""7ragha""   , he mastered every detail of his job in a couple of  months and everyone was so impressed by his work quality and his attention to every minute detail of our Softwares.

&#x200B;

After two year he  was the head of QA in our company , He did it while acquiring more certificates and working on himself even more .  He outgrew the company (salary wise) so he decided to move to a another one 

&#x200B;

last time I met him dude was making 120K in well known company and  has more certificates then his BOSS .

Dude is a legend , he inspired all of us  , I tell his story everytime I get the chance.",2024-01-05 17:57:23

Staying there is cool, getting caught being intimate is illegal.

But there is also a possibility they actually do press charges just cuz fk you ruining ur day makes their day. Usually janitor/concierge ultimately yakhra fih as long as neighbors dont hear or see shit (unless they are also cunts). As for his intentions it is the same as ur average mnayek: ""tnokh?

He either wants a piece of the cake (your cake) or ruin ur life outta jealousy. Idc what responsibilities he has, he has no business asking for ur phone number.
BUT, I dont know if ur bf being a foreigner is actually another law that idk about. So u should look deeply into that.

Tldr: keep ur wits about u, dont stay waiting near the cunt. Limit ur contact with him BUT when u do see him, act ""nicely"" dont provoke him. Look deeply into the law, either by asking an actual lawyer wala kasser rassek w googli. We all been doing this shit raho w the pigs know, as long u give them no reason to report u, u should be fine.

Tunisian father living in France here.

Kids since their first months are exposed to French at least 70% of their time, even if parents talk to them in Arabic, the first language they will pick up is French. Almost every one around them except for their parents speak french, but kids actually figure out pretty early that their parents speak a different language, and will adapt rapidly, my kid, which is starting to speak more and more uses some Arabic words exclusively with us. I always ask at the daycare and school if my kid uses some Arabic words and their answer is ""No"", actually they didn't know that my kid spoke any Arabic.

When kids grow up, some parents don't care if their kids learn how to speak Arabic properly, and it can be hard to dedicate time and money to achieve that, so they just let it go, they don't plan going back to Tunisia anyways, so why bother. Some other parents will do that effort, and will ""force"" their kids to use Arabic when family is around.

People in general, have a preferred language that they use to communicate and express themselves, if you lived all your life in France, it will be easier for you to use french, if you lived in Spain, that would be Spanish if you lived in the Egypt, that would Egyptian Arabic.

The lawyer has to do its best to get a conviction and an international arrest warrant. However, don't publish anything that might cause you problems, like his photo and say that he is the murderer, before he is officially indicted. Basically don't sabotage the procedure. You'll have to be patient.

I assume the murderer is smart enough to go to a country that will not extradite him to Tunisia like Italy or France, so you will hope that interpole will catch him if he travels.

>if you believe 80 % of humans 1000 years ago are pedos then you are insane

80%? Where did you get this number? **Stop lying to defend your religion.**

**Anyone who has had sex with a child is a fucking pedo, whether it's from 1000 years ago, 2000 years ago, or 300,000 years ago. MAN, Fuck the PDF files and their defenders.**

Tbh, this kind of nonsense, not only disgusts me, but really makes my blood boil.

Well, Aisha was a young girl. [https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5134](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5134)

[https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3324](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3324)

>It was narrated that 'Aishah said: “*My mother* was trying to ***FATTEN ME UP*** when she wanted to send me to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) (when she got married')...

&#x200B;

In case you don't believe in Sunnah:

There is not even a single verse in Quran that forbids pedophilia. **In fact, The Quran is absolutely OK with child marriage here as in this verse:**

[https://surahquran.com/aya-tafsir-4-65.html](https://surahquran.com/aya-tafsir-4-65.html)

>**وَاللَّائِي لَمْ يَحِضْنَ**

&#x200B;

So STOP trying to defend child marriage. It's really disgusting.

>if you beleive there are countless errors in Holy Quran you you are ignorant ... there is none.

Ofc, you keep lying over and over again. Like man, could you please stop?

There are many, but let me give you one example or two because I don't have all day, and I'm not here to teach you your religion.

The Quran states that humans think [from their hearts, not their brains,](https://quran.com/en/al-hajj/46) and confirms that in many verses. And that clearly contradicts science. Muhammad fell in the same scientific mistake as the people of his time, and the concept of the heart as the source of the intellect was common in that region around that time.   


Islam 100% contradicts evolution in many verses, and falls into the same mistake as other religions such as Christianity, Judaism, etc.

[https://quran.com/15?startingVerse=26](https://quran.com/15?startingVerse=26)[https://quran.com/3?startingVerse=59](https://quran.com/3?startingVerse=59)

>if you beleive something can result from nothing ..... then you do you

There are many other hypotheses out there that try to explain how the universe came into existence, **and they are more plausible than the God hypothesis.** I mean, I'm not here to teach you science either. But even if I go with you and say that ""God exists,"" I'm 100% sure he is NOT the God of Islam.",2024-01-05 12:19:09

It is illegal but no immediate action will be taken agains the API consumer, the party holding the API needs to file a lawsuit and prove the inappropriate usage of their data by the defendant, and the incurred financial damage. So if i use your API and make 1tnd on top of it, no judge will award a lawsuit over that amount, on the contrary you will be wasting the court's time and you might be pubnished for it.

I'll say about her she was a kind, smart, stubborn dumb ass ( said with love). She couldn't take what happened to her and fought for her right. She paid the ultimate price. We all told her to take the cowards way out. Get free of him and that in itself is a win. But she refused. The hand of the law was slow.
