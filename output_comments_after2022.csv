>Every woman has a right to tell you to fuck off if you're a mysogynist.

Wow, what a revolutionary take. But, is it actually relevant to what I said? When did I ever say that women don't have the right to say fuck off?

>And even worse- an incel.

Incel is short for involuntary celibate. Incel is a derogatory term because it's often associated with misogyny, but being an incel isn't worse than being a misogynist. Incel = someone who wants to be in a romantic relationship but can't (it can be due to his attractiveness, his personal sense of confidence. but it can also be due to misogyny which shapes his view world negatively and affects potential relationships). Misogyny = plain hatred against women.
Being a misogynist is way worse than being an incel if we base ourselves on standard definition.

>Women don't need to coddle you and risk their safety just so that you can stop crying.

That's cool, when did I say they should?

>Your misery and loneliness are your own doing.

That's partially true. Lonely people sometimes become lonely due to things outside their control. But I agree with you on the importance of bearing personal responsibility for your circumstances because it can lead to positive change.

You can do your own makeup, or you can also book a more skilled makeup artist (I recommend ""feryel studio"" or ""lobna ben ammar"" if your wedding is in Tunis).
Of course you can dance and party all night long, the sitting part is really outdated and usually only done for photos and for resting between dances ! As for the witness in baladeya, it can be a woman without any problem.
I would add one advice regarding alcohol, some tunisian families consume it openly in weddings, some prefer to hide it, some forbid it completely, so you should discuss it with your fiance beforehand and inform your own family about that.",2024-01-02 17:11:43

She also said she would be in grave danger of death if she ever comes back to Tunisia. The college believed her lies without fact-checking, granted her a scholarship and posted her essay in their website as a success story. They made it look like someone escaped North Korea or smth. Soon after, many Tunisians reacted to this, including academics from Tataouine, emailed the Minneapolis college to alert them.

Some countries have poor economy like venezeulla or argentina and they have visa free to europe because of the far distance between europe and them

Also, he didn't even tell their family members where he executed them and he even refused to give their remains to their families so they could bury them with dignity. Let's not forget he made it damn sure that their families were ostracized from society and made it illegal for anyone to help them or even interact with them. Lazhar Chrayti's family members were even asked to change their names in order for them to not be persecuted by the state. 

All of this after taking advantage of the resistance fighters and their armed struggle against the French, in order for him to eventually gain power and all of this after promising them a life of dignity and comfort after the independence. A promise which he obviously chose not to honor, since he was a pathological liar, tyrant and narcissist who only cared about himself.

You heavily subsidize/cover the losses of the second business with the first business money.

 - Being close  allies to the governing power ( turks , french , bourguibist , purple diarreha and trabelsia , ennahdha …)  which general  masses perceives as a betrayal for their causes and suffering 

- being extremely corrupt and unethical ( in a corrupt country that’s almost only way to get that rich). 

- using and abusing the working class in every possible way , from the lousy salaries to the hazards and risks they put their employees on ( nse elli tatla3 fil kmayen men teli for example)


Not that i completely agree with generalizing those ideas , but one can debate that those claims have some truth into them.

I believe most people choose something less heavy than the traditional wedding dresses for the townhall ceremony. What has been popular recently are suits inspired by traditional dresses. You’ll find quite a few businesses that specialize in that if you search in FB, IG, TikTok.

Again facts don't care about your feelings , the facts are he DID commit genocide, spreading misinformation to uneducated turks and tunisians but let me correct you rq the Armenian genocide didn't start and end in 1915. Ataurk commited genocide in Cilcia in 1919, in Marash in 1920 which was accompanied by large-scale slaughtering of the Armenians, spelled the beginning of the end for the remnant Armenian population, in October 1920 against the Armenians of hajen.

When the French formally agreed to evacuate Cilicia in October 1921, the debacle signified a second deportation for the Armenians of the region. 
In the meantime, the Turkish Nationalist forces had gone to war against the Republic of Armenia.

And the list if atrocities goes on, so before you spread misinformation remember in other subs it might work but here you get fact checked sentence by sentence.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian\_genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_genocide) Armenian Genocide happened in 1915 while Atatürk was a colonel in Galippoli. Even the most severe Turkophobes that have historica knowledge don't accuse him of genocide. I sometimes feel that people are doing this intentionally. Saying Atatürk he did the genocide is like saying Merkel did the Holocaust. They were not even there during the dates.

I personally don't believe that it is our right to decide if other nations can become shit with/without somethig. I am a Turk, I respect other nations and demand such from the others. I have my own identity, so do others.

Why be a lifeless moron that literally consumes his times ""Haha! No you are nothing haha! We gave you identity! You are worthless haha admit it!""The First Turkic Khaganate was established in 6th century even before Mohammed was born.

A person with a low IQ might not be able to do certain things but that is not the same as a population with an average IQ that is lower than other populations. To prove your theory, you need to provide evidence from well-conducted epidemiological studies showing that those who are born to cousins have on average lower IQ than those who were born to non-related parent in the SAME culture and environment.

During that period, as a Tunisian living abroad, I remember going to school holding my held high and feeling so proud and exited because I came from a country with such strong national teams, both in football and handball, and I knew that all of my friends had witnessed their strength as well, and were going to talk to me about it. This was my oxygen and my cryptonite. These were the things I literally lived for. 

It began with our football team taking home the winning trophy of CAN 2004, followed by the outstanding performance of our handball team at the 2005 world cup, and then our football team qualifying for the 2006 world cup.

If someone starts to use jargon or concepts that you dont understand  you should inform them . It is ok to not understand something, it is a sin and a huge loss of time for everyone when you pretend that you do .

Second , give a great importance to the quality of your code , writing code professionally is different then writing code for academic projects so take a minute to think about variable naming , classes and functions length and best practices in general 
Bonus : if you write  great detailed  documentation that would definitely leave a great impression

I am glad another tunisian is really feeling fed up w the whole ""A9RA ALLEMANDD"" stuff,language is culture,more than anything,you should learn a language youre culturally intresting in.As for what language I recommend,I recommend choosing based on two factors(if youre really doing this purely for fun,ofc)

First,I would recommend something you enjoy,and that has a big culture behind it,for example,espagnol has intresting lit,cinema,and internet presence,italian,russian too,japanese,chinese....you should also enjoy it,and find it beautiful.

Second,I really would recommend something excentric,why?You said you liked to learn new stuff,and the more obscure and distant is the language,the more different it is.You have to force your brain to think in new concepts,new  and it really fun if you do enjoy learning new stuff,languages with new concepts include chinese mandarin,russian,japanese.

choose based on these two criterias,my only recommendation is:self learning chinese is brutal,like borderline torture bc of the tones and script unless youre really into it,I wouldnt chose it,russian and jap are brutal but manageable,italian,swedish,spanish,are boring(imo,not an objective fact) but easy",2024-01-01 00:07:47

They know nothing about his achievements and the good he did for turkey and why turks see him as a hero and a founding father for turkey.

I read a little about Attaturk (not much but the basics  ) i know that during WWI he literally saved turkey from being split into multiple parts controlled by colonial powers, turkey was on the brink of losing its sovereignity, it was on the brink of losing Constantinople and hagia sophia but he came from a position of weakness with turkey almost losing everything, he led the armies and drove out all those who came with the goal to conquer and divide turkey. 

One other message perhaps for my fellow tunisians on why a great number of turks and attaturk hate arabs it's because they see that the arabs betrayed them and stabbed them in the back (which is true they betrayed the turks for the brits but then the arabs themselves were betrayed by the brits).

I honestly have nothing against turks.",2023-12-31 20:52:03

[https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1136&context=gc\_etds](https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1136&context=gc_etds)

Basically, on Mt Bou Qornine, a temple dated to the Roman era for Saturnus Balcaranensis was found in 1891. The assumption in 1896 was that the name implied an already existing sanctuary for Baal Hamon (Saturnus was identified with Baal Hamon by the Romans) and Balcaranensis was a Latin transcription of the Punic ""Baal Qarnaïm"" which meant ""Lord of the Horns"". The whole idea was to link Baal Hamon with the Hellenistic depictions of Zeus with two horns. The issue is there hasn't been a single depiction of Baal Hamon discovered that show him with horns. Not only that, but if we look at the name, it is ""Lord of the two horns"", not ""Lord with the two horns"", because in Punic (just like Arabic), a horn can imply an elevated area. In other words, if we assume this is a continuation of an already existing Punic sanctuary, then the inscription is dedicated to Baal Hamon, the Lord of the Two Horns (Peaks). The epithet was toponymic, not descriptive of a God

>A similar mistranslation in the case of Qarnaïm is not surprising, as it is now generally recognized that the epithet does not connote the horns which would eventually come characterize the god (after late contamination with the cult of Zeus/Jupiter Ammon), but is purely toponymic in reference, indicating the remarkable situation of the sanctuary on the taller of the twin peaks of Bu-Kournein, and not any special characteristic of the god",2023-12-31 20:44:17

Second, the RNTA is probably the absolute worst of all the cigarette companies selling in Tunisia because they're the cheapest and therefore most accessible to teens. It's not like local cigarettes are sold with parental guidance while foreign ones aren't. So this state owned benevolent tobacco company theory doesn't hold whatsoever.

I don't know what you're referring to when you say cost to be made but either way if RNTA is losing then the overall cost is more than what they should sell for because if it was a private company it would either raise prices or go bankrupt. It's a production subsidy.

Besides, even if RNTA were making money, it's still bad because the issue I'm talking about is the government encouraging cigarettes by being a player in it and also by having a conflict of interest.

The fact that the government is choosing not to sell RNTA and local cigarettes prices are set as cheap shows you that the high taxes on other types of cigarettes is basically just to get money, it's not about some kind of a vision to reduce smoking... otherwise again do the obvious and don't produce cigarettes.

My post simply asks whether the usage of UNOFFICIAL API is illegal or not. Plain and simple, if you do not know what Unofficial API is, then don't answer, here is a definition:

Unofficial APIs are **typically created by developers who want to provide access to data or functionality that is not available through an official API**. These APIs are usually reverse-engineered or developed using tools that allow the extraction of data from web pages or other software.

kg5dm4v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/q9kwim/dating/kg5dm4v/,1,"I will give you some realistic and honest advice that can help you improve your chances of meeting someone compatible. This has also helped me when I was in your shoes. 

First of all, don't despair. You are not alone in your situation. Many men struggle with finding a partner, especially in today's fast-paced and competitive world. There is nothing wrong with you, and you have plenty of time to find love. You are still young and have a lot to offer.

Second, don't limit yourself to your workplace or your immediate circle of friends. You need to expand your horizons and meet new people who share your interests and values. There are many ways to do that, such as joining online communities, taking classes, volunteering, attending events, or traveling. You can also use dating apps like Tinder, but be aware that they are not a magic solution. You still need to put effort into creating a good profile, sending engaging messages, and being respectful and honest with your matches.

Third, don't be afraid to express yourself and show your personality. You have some interesting hobbies, such as anime, reading, and coding, that can make you stand out and attract like-minded women. You don't have to pretend to be someone you are not, or hide your passions. Be confident and proud of who you are, and what you can offer. Women appreciate men who are authentic, passionate, and curious.

Fourth, don't give up on yourself or on women. You may face some rejections, disappointments, or ghosting along the way, but that's part of the dating process. Don't take it personally, or let it affect your self-esteem. Learn from your mistakes, and move on. There are many women out there who are looking for a genuine and caring partner like you. You just have to keep trying, and be patient.

Fifth, don't forget to have fun and enjoy the journey. Dating is not a chore, or a race, or a test. It's an opportunity to meet new people, learn new things, have new experiences, and grow as a person. Don't put too much pressure on yourself, or on the outcome. Focus on the present, and the connection. Be yourself, be respectful, be attentive, be playful, and be open-minded. You never know when or where you might find your girlfriend.

I hope this advice helps you.",2024-01-03 17:10:49

don't give the impression of a threat to anyone ( even other interns ) and give your colleges and supervisors the chance to shine and feels important    


in my case i was more of a self learner and didn't give much about the uni or their outdated study program . which allowed  me to have some  real experience in the field , anyways on the internship i found a lot of old and messed up code, soo i suggested  and even convinced the supervisors  of updating a part of the  old code base before adding any new feature (it wasn't easy i got into small conflicts )  


of course this affected the whole team which made me appear like some one who is trying to steal theirs job and if not am gonna make it harder because i was kinda the leader of this big change in the plan  

at the end of the internship i could see it in there eyes that they were soo happy to see me leaving

When I hear 'I thought they were against it,' I wonder, against what exactly? And who are 'they' referring to - Arabs, Muslims, North Africans?  These stores are probably family-owned and passed down through generations.  If it proves anything, it's that women don't seem hesitant to purchase lingerie in establishments run by men. 

You don't need to get upset when visiting stores run by men. It's not your problem. We don't get upset when we see that in France, for example, the law prohibiting women from wearing pants was only abolished in 2013. 

 When traveling abroad, we don't automatically assume that women lack certain rights because we don't witness them exercising those rights.   It's because you project the idea that you are at the pinnacle of women's rights, even though, for example, in terms of abortion,  we might be better than you,   with little to no debate on the subject except for discussions on social media.

If Sigma Conseil tells you that *x* percentage of people plan to vote for *y* candidate, they can't sue you for repeating and republishing that information again as if you republished a copyrighted movie. Similarly, the national meteorological institute can't sue you for saying that the temperature will be 15°C tomorrow because you can't own data.

Frist of all ! no of you or you mother have to do with his life he is an adult and he knows what the right and whats bad . I talked with my dad about it and he was crystal clear that he wanna divorce with my mom . We decided that we will the hole family about the divorce.  He just dont wanna life with her anymore. Mom accepted the divorce then life continues  . Btw know that cheating is illegal and haram but as we are grown adults he chooses with me when i found out that he will assume consequences. As i mentioned we told my mom and to bze honset she was so upset but she knows that she cant force him to stay.  Any way  after year they get a divorce and i keept a good relationship with my parents 

Tip : talk to your dad about it. And dont you ever talk your mother alone about this . You shloud talk to your dad frist then your fathers family.

No one can check that the parents are respecting that rule, and meanwhile, children are exposed to that poison, and to the risk of getting some diseases

Speaking of diseases, smoking causes a lot of those, heart, respiratory, digestive, skin, neurological, blood vessels diseases, when a smoker gets sick, he will need to be treated, most of the time, it is a lost cause, they will die anyway or live with a lot of disabilities, and the public is going to pay for that, so that's a waste of public money. I am sorry, I don't want to pay for someone's bad choices (And before you go down that road, one chooses to smoke or drink alcohol, but no one chooses to be poor or have bad luck...)

Have a study to share with us that proves that (don't share me a sensational link about an incident caused by a Tunisian immigrant, that proves nothing)? Or is it the usual information from news outlets that made you say that? What's a high-quality immigrant according to you? Enlighten us please.

All Tunisians I met (yes. ALL.) in Germany (and I met hundreds) were absolutely non-problematic at all. Most of them worked in well-known companies/institutions (VW, Continental, etc.) and even if they didn't, they were extremely non-problematic.  
These Tunisians are making an extremely important contribution to EU economy: they are young, educated, culturally close to EU and EU wasted 0 Euros on their upbringing. This is especially true since the demographics of EU aren't looking good at all.  


All it takes is just one person from MENA region to commit a crime for news outlets to go insane. If the latest incident in Prague was done by a person having an immigration background, world would've gone crazy.

These VISA restrictions existed way before the illegal migration crisis and probably proves that western countries have some sort of... how to say it... eh... hate and prejudice towards people from MENA region. (will get downvoted to hell because how dare I say this to people here)

A buyer and a seller agree on a price for a share or a commodity etc. The buyer is buying because they think the share is undervalued. The seller is selling because they think the share is at the right value or overvalued.

One of these parties is automatically wrong for this transaction. It might be the other way around for the next one. 

Institutional investors own roughly 80% of the market. They compete against each other for the best mathematicians, algorithms, computing power and networking circuits.

Your question suggested that you were relatively new to this and were looking for people with more experience. I will not try to judge the quality of my experience but by quantity I would say I am fairly experienced having started investing 26 years ago.

As far as I know, according to Islamic scholars, buying shares in other companies is halal subject to a few conditions, namely that the company should not take loans with interest (ribaa) to finance its operations or operate in non-halal areas such as non-Islamic banking and insurance.

Also if the iPhone is original, there is no Original iPhone better than another Original iPhone.

Also you should note that used iPhones are another case, there are some used iPhones which their sensors had been worn out by time making them look “worse” compared to other same models.

Finding out an iPhone is fake is very simple, a camera that does not function as expected isn’t a sign that it is fake, rather a malfunction.

And you get a job, start adding 50 or 100 dinars each month in it. on the long term, you will make profit, after 8 years, you will be exempt from all taxes on those profits. A small simulation: if you put 4000 as a start, and 100tnd every month for 8 years with a yearly performance of 5% after 8 years you end up with more than 18k TND exempt from taxes, you would have invested 14k that's a 4k profit, after 20 years that's more than 50k and you would have invested 28k.

Those are very rough numbers calculated hastily, but you should approach an insurance company and ask for details, they will present a simulation with more accurate numbers.

You should know that when you just save that money into a savings account, if the interest is lower than inflation rates, you will be losing money, while investments in markets should generate rates higher than inflation (unless there are global economic crisis, like in 2008)

You should also know that there is a risk of losing money, that's why when you invest, you diversify your placements

https://m.gsmarena.com/apple_iphone_13-review-2325p5.php 

As the opposite they were kinda a bad and blurry . Even the iphone is on warranty and ""M"" model and when i checked it it was officiall but there's are a huge difference in pictures between them . That's why in my own mind and i might be wrong the safest way is to be from a legit reseller from apple in tunisia like zoom or istore .

Don't, just don't, you're buying the phone at 2x the retail price.

The cheapest and safest way to buy an iPhone is to buy it from another country (preferably USA/Canada/UAE) by telling a friend to buy you or going by yourself. There are other ways to get it from abroad, which is via ***KNOWN*** (not retail/reseller) stores, though they do sketchy stuff to get you that iPhone (such as registering the iPhone's IMEI with someone else's passport at a price), but at the end of the day it's an actual real iPhone.

Stores that I know of are (search on insta): Best Phone, PStore+, Tokyo Store... They usually give you waranty.

If you research enough and learn how to find a counterfeit/used iPhone, you can search on Facebook marketplace / Tayara and review the iPhone for yourself, usually they claim they're new and imported.",2024-01-04 16:48:43

Why? Because people are misogynistic according to your worldview? I respect your opinion, I agree that there is a sizable percentage of people that are sexist, but your statement is just plain speculation and it has no merit. Even in this post, there are numerous posts that advised OP to tell his mother. And a lot of posts that told OP to not tell his mother have some sort of rationale behind it (his mother has mental health problems so the revelation might affect her severely. in addition to that, she'll likely get a divorce which is going to affect everyone, including OP).

But democracy is a pretty straightforward concept, all I’m saying is that the people can’t lead, they never have and never will. 

You can’t call a lemon an orange because in your opinion it’s close enough. 

No country is in reality democratic, we’re welcome to try but the result will just be a different governmental system and not actual democracy. 

Everyone loves throwing that word around in politics to get people to trust them and vote for them, that’s why the spectrum was created in the first place, to give you and many others false hope that your voice actually matters or holds any weight or that your wants and needs were carefully considered when decisions were being made.

As did Tunisia on several occasions, most of them in Bourguiba's era. He even sent thousands of unknowing innocent people to their deaths in the Battle of Bizerte just to make himself look like a war hero to Jamal Abdelnasser.

As for the crimes committed by other Arab countries, Bourguiba didn't commit them because he didn't have the army and the population that was man enough to challenge him.

I grew up in a household with a lot of fighting myself. And I can't say it didn't affect me negatively.

That's why women should be independent and have a high education, not being forced to be with men, which don't respect them.

 If you are a software engineer you should be able to make money out of thin air. 
There are thousands of niches you can get into that can make you millions of dollars as an engineer and you don't need other people to hire you to do so.

 Build your own knowledge and experience and you will get to a point where you are really good at a specific thing, then many people will want to work with you instead of being a run of the mill junior with a degree who is almost a liability rather than an asset. 

If you know two more software developers then start a company and build a product or service. Maybe you know a teacher who knows a product missing from the educational space then you help them develop it and become cofounders.

All the successful people I know in the industry have tremendous experience in a very niche area and that's how they can distinguish themselves from the millions of other developers.

Work on open source projects and find what you like to do most and what you excel at and work and money will follow. 

You can work freelance or build a company with your friends or build APIs or do hackathons or find small startups and work for free to get experience. 

The more connections you have and the more people you know the more opportunities you will have. 
Just looking for an office job will not get you anywhere even if you get the job you will make at best a slightly above average salary with no real prospects. 

Be creative. This industry is over-hyped for the average person who wants a 9-5, but if you are a creative person then you will not have any problems making money and lots of it at that. You just have to think big, learn and innovate and you will become very successful.

Trust me I know many many people in IT. From people who work in tech conglomerates to CTOs of big startups, to people who are founding their own ventures and people who are building new knowledge as academics. All of them are very successful in different ways. You just have to find something and be good at it and the money will follow.",2024-01-05 23:23:31

- If the person is really close (family), I never give it much importance. ""Hadheka had mokhou,"" so either I smile and let it be or I give a sarcastic comment that gives their fish brain a hard time.

  **Example:**
  - *Comment:* ""You look really old (dhhar 3lik lkobr).""
  - *Response:* ""I am living my life to its fullest. I have a lot going on while other people are still in the same spot they were 5 years ago (3Ayech 7yeti biltoul wbil3ardh w 3andibarcha mchaghil, mech kima barcha 3bed mazelet fi nafs lblassa).""

- If the person is a stranger, I will be as blunt as it gets (I do this especially at work).

  **Example:**
  - *Comment:* ""You gained a lot of weight.""
  - *Response:* ""It's none of your business / fuck off (oumour z*** ma3andik mamdakhlikfeha / rabbi ylahhina fi 7wayejna / ken telhit fi rou7ik khir).""",2024-01-05 18:15:46

As for the choice , I would say that your Best bet would be  in software Quality assurance ( QA testing ) as it does not require advanced technical skills and relies primarily  a Attention details and solid communication skills  .

I might have an inspiring story for you .

three years ago we had a vacancy in QA , one of the candidate was a 39  accountant who worked in ""quincaillerie"" for 12 years , and decided he has more potential  and can achieve more ,so he  quit his job and took online courses and certificates for quality assurance.

My boss and I  decided to  bet on him as he have shown a great desire and resilience  even though his english was really bad and we an english speaking company .

The guy did not disappoint , literally ""7ragha""   , he mastered every detail of his job in a couple of  months and everyone was so impressed by his work quality and his attention to every minute detail of our Softwares.

&#x200B;

After two year he  was the head of QA in our company , He did it while acquiring more certificates and working on himself even more .  He outgrew the company (salary wise) so he decided to move to a another one 

&#x200B;

last time I met him dude was making 120K in well known company and  has more certificates then his BOSS .

Dude is a legend , he inspired all of us  , I tell his story everytime I get the chance.",2024-01-05 17:57:23

Staying there is cool, getting caught being intimate is illegal.

But there is also a possibility they actually do press charges just cuz fk you ruining ur day makes their day. Usually janitor/concierge ultimately yakhra fih as long as neighbors dont hear or see shit (unless they are also cunts). As for his intentions it is the same as ur average mnayek: ""tnokh?

He either wants a piece of the cake (your cake) or ruin ur life outta jealousy. Idc what responsibilities he has, he has no business asking for ur phone number.
BUT, I dont know if ur bf being a foreigner is actually another law that idk about. So u should look deeply into that.

Tldr: keep ur wits about u, dont stay waiting near the cunt. Limit ur contact with him BUT when u do see him, act ""nicely"" dont provoke him. Look deeply into the law, either by asking an actual lawyer wala kasser rassek w googli. We all been doing this shit raho w the pigs know, as long u give them no reason to report u, u should be fine.

Tunisian father living in France here.

Kids since their first months are exposed to French at least 70% of their time, even if parents talk to them in Arabic, the first language they will pick up is French. Almost every one around them except for their parents speak french, but kids actually figure out pretty early that their parents speak a different language, and will adapt rapidly, my kid, which is starting to speak more and more uses some Arabic words exclusively with us. I always ask at the daycare and school if my kid uses some Arabic words and their answer is ""No"", actually they didn't know that my kid spoke any Arabic.

When kids grow up, some parents don't care if their kids learn how to speak Arabic properly, and it can be hard to dedicate time and money to achieve that, so they just let it go, they don't plan going back to Tunisia anyways, so why bother. Some other parents will do that effort, and will ""force"" their kids to use Arabic when family is around.

People in general, have a preferred language that they use to communicate and express themselves, if you lived all your life in France, it will be easier for you to use french, if you lived in Spain, that would be Spanish if you lived in the Egypt, that would Egyptian Arabic.

The lawyer has to do its best to get a conviction and an international arrest warrant. However, don't publish anything that might cause you problems, like his photo and say that he is the murderer, before he is officially indicted. Basically don't sabotage the procedure. You'll have to be patient.

I assume the murderer is smart enough to go to a country that will not extradite him to Tunisia like Italy or France, so you will hope that interpole will catch him if he travels.

>if you believe 80 % of humans 1000 years ago are pedos then you are insane

80%? Where did you get this number? **Stop lying to defend your religion.**

**Anyone who has had sex with a child is a fucking pedo, whether it's from 1000 years ago, 2000 years ago, or 300,000 years ago. MAN, Fuck the PDF files and their defenders.**

Tbh, this kind of nonsense, not only disgusts me, but really makes my blood boil.

Well, Aisha was a young girl. [https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5134](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5134)

[https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3324](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3324)

>It was narrated that 'Aishah said: “*My mother* was trying to ***FATTEN ME UP*** when she wanted to send me to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) (when she got married')...

&#x200B;

In case you don't believe in Sunnah:

There is not even a single verse in Quran that forbids pedophilia. **In fact, The Quran is absolutely OK with child marriage here as in this verse:**

[https://surahquran.com/aya-tafsir-4-65.html](https://surahquran.com/aya-tafsir-4-65.html)

>**وَاللَّائِي لَمْ يَحِضْنَ**

&#x200B;

So STOP trying to defend child marriage. It's really disgusting.

>if you beleive there are countless errors in Holy Quran you you are ignorant ... there is none.

Ofc, you keep lying over and over again. Like man, could you please stop?

There are many, but let me give you one example or two because I don't have all day, and I'm not here to teach you your religion.

The Quran states that humans think [from their hearts, not their brains,](https://quran.com/en/al-hajj/46) and confirms that in many verses. And that clearly contradicts science. Muhammad fell in the same scientific mistake as the people of his time, and the concept of the heart as the source of the intellect was common in that region around that time.   


Islam 100% contradicts evolution in many verses, and falls into the same mistake as other religions such as Christianity, Judaism, etc.

[https://quran.com/15?startingVerse=26](https://quran.com/15?startingVerse=26)[https://quran.com/3?startingVerse=59](https://quran.com/3?startingVerse=59)

>if you beleive something can result from nothing ..... then you do you

There are many other hypotheses out there that try to explain how the universe came into existence, **and they are more plausible than the God hypothesis.** I mean, I'm not here to teach you science either. But even if I go with you and say that ""God exists,"" I'm 100% sure he is NOT the God of Islam.",2024-01-05 12:19:09

It is illegal but no immediate action will be taken agains the API consumer, the party holding the API needs to file a lawsuit and prove the inappropriate usage of their data by the defendant, and the incurred financial damage. So if i use your API and make 1tnd on top of it, no judge will award a lawsuit over that amount, on the contrary you will be wasting the court's time and you might be pubnished for it.

I'll say about her she was a kind, smart, stubborn dumb ass ( said with love). She couldn't take what happened to her and fought for her right. She paid the ultimate price. We all told her to take the cowards way out. Get free of him and that in itself is a win. But she refused. The hand of the law was slow.

\> the claims is ridiculous it goes way back to abram in Mesopotamia

It sure is lol. Good chance he will come out Berber. Most Berber tribes like frechich and wled ayer used to claim arab lineage just for modern DNA studies to prove them wrong. Tunisia is among the most homogenous in the Mediterranean when it comes to paternal lineage. 71 percent of Tunisians come for amazigh lineages.

\> We have a lot of Arabs here especially if you're from Kairouan and the Areas where Caliphates settled

The arabs that came with caliphates are called Ashraf Arabs and there aren't quite a lot of them. Most of our arabs came either through Banu hilal immigration or later muslims running away from reconquista in Andalus.

\> Kairouen

Kairouen shows heavy berber ancestry in the city itself and arab ancestry in the villages surrounding it. I think banu hilal settled around the city.

\> not surprised that you're mostly Arab

I expected it. I come from Mthalith confederate.

\> most of us should be Phoenicians (Canaanites) and Amazigh I believe.

Most of us are Berbers and we have little to none Phoenicians ancestry. DNA studies around the mediterranean shows all the antiquity cities supposedly founded by Phoenicians in places like sicily , sardinia, spain have no Phoenicians  ancestry but rather believe or not Berber ancestry. It seems the few Phoenicians that came fisrt got absorbed and we just adopted to culture/religion. Berbers were the the later phoencians.

kgn3cci,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1908gcu/just_got_back_from_tunisia_wow/kgn3cci/,4,"I’ll give you 5 reasons:

1.	Maintaining Regional Stability: By supporting Palestine, the U.S. aims to appear as a balanced mediator in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This support is crucial for the U.S. to be able to advance its goals while the world thinks it’s looking out for peace and security for all. 

2.	International Image: the U.S. loves to don the hat of the global benefactor, a generous giant doling out aid to maintain its international image. Supporting Palestine helps the U.S. present itself as an equitable player on the world stage, concerned with human rights and resolving conflicts. It’s a form of soft power. 

3.	Counterbalancing Influence: The U.S. is well aware that a power vacuum in Palestine could invite unwelcome guests. By providing aid, the U.S. ensures that other potential influencers (think Iran, or Russia and China) don’t gain a foothold. It’s like keeping your enemies close but your frenemies closer.


4.	Leverage in Peace Talks: Financial aid gives 
the U.S. leverage in Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. It’s akin to holding the carrot in front of the horse – ensuring that you have a say in how the horse trots.

5. Domestic Politics: Never underestimate the influence of domestic politics in foreign policy decisions. Supporting Palestine can appease certain domestic political groups in the U.S., you see now how Biden is trying (and failing) to tiptoe that line between supporting Israel for his zionist voter base and supporting peace for his other, larger voter base 

Others have put it in much better terms than I have; for that I’ll implore you to check out Nye’s work on ‘complex interdependence;’ dependency theory by Andre Gunder Frank, Brzezinski’s “the grand chessboard” and “dead aid” by dambisa moyo.

kgmvigk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/18zpmob/are_jendouba_bulla_regia_el_kef_and_subaytilah/kgmvigk/,1,"depends. there are some genuinly dangerous areas. usually law enforcement will place warnings or be on guard duty and prevent you from going to said places.

in cities, the danger is that like any other city on the planet, there are unsavory people who may mug you if you go to an unpopulated area at a bad time of the day.

if you plan to go camping in the outdoors, there is the regular warning of being aware of wild animals like wolves and boars in those areas.

the real issue in my opinion as a resident of Bou Salem (a city in the governorate/state of Jendouba) is transportation. it gets a bit tricky since we mostly rely on collective taxis or whatever they are called in english (vans that transport up to 8 people), and each car has a set trajectory, will only depart with a full passenger load, and there aren't many cars or people travelling depending on the destination. public transportation is an alternative but not very reliable.

another issue you may face is the language barrier. i'll probably get some hate for this, but in general, people driving those transports aren't versed in languages, so if you don't know arabic and french, you may struggle a bit. and with how different some things operate here compared to the other countries you visited, it may be a bit confusing for a first timer.

hopefully, you'll find someone who can help for a bit until you get used to stuff.

if you have a question and need more details, feel free to dm me, and i'll try to answer to the best of my ability",2024-01-06 21:02:45

The reason for the discontinuation of the flight has to do with the limited Slots available at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport  and Tunis Air not respecting their slot times. If an airline doesn't respect their alloted slot times by having to many delays and cancellations, the Dutch Aviation authority will cancel their slots. Tunis Air could in theory request new slots (don't know if they did so or not), but there is a waiting list.

Remember back in 2021 when there were very long lines for people to get the covid vaccine, and there was an absolute fiasco with the organisation?  Our current president / national savior took over power because of that event. Not long after that people stopped wanting the vaccine altogether. You see this phenomenon in other things too like when at one time every radio station had some token foreigner as a ""chroniqueur"". I don't find any of them now. People complain that Zgougou is more expensive each year, but the lines at the Zgougou shop in rue d'Espagne are just as long each year.

This is our culture:   
أخلط لا تمنك   
We all think similarly. And I'm not saying that this is a purely Tunisian thing. It may well be a global phenomenon.

This is made worse by our successive leaders' inability, or unwillingness, to think strategically. The first president considered the country to be his own plaything, and saw himself as a genius, a nigh-sanctified being. So he tried a thing after another, including an attempt at ruling until death. The second president took the job like any other government employee would: a way to make money, further his personal objectives, and use his position to help others who can help him personally or his family.

For me personally, I would not go mountain man camping Bear Grylls style solo south of Jendouba or in Kasserine - too remote, not much to see, and a very slight possibility of accidentally running into a lunatic yahoo living off berries running away from Tunisian Military forces. ;)

It depends if u're a devout person u will find it haram but generally speaking in tunisia everyone is doing it anyway just don't do it publicly bcz it's illegal.

> Do Tunisian girls know how to kiss a boy? (after marriage) and how can I show affection to a Tunisian girl without making her uncomfortable?

Again tunisian girls are not aliens, who doesn't as human beings we know these things it's normal n natural to show affection to ur significant other, It depends if she's experienced or not ofc if she never kissed someone before it would be weird at first.

First u should make a good bond with her n know from her body language if she's into u or not if u connect well with each other then u can ask her it's simple but u should respect her if she wants to do this with u or nah.",2024-01-06 14:09:45

If you remove:

* the trip (less ~30k)

* reduce the cost of some of the house items (less ~5k, in your case all the house stuff)

* do it in a ""sala"" not a Hotel (less ~3k)

* Rent a suit instead of buying it (less ~2k)

* cheaper gold (less ~2k) though what we did was super cheap too because we didn't even want to do it, it was ""me5dha fel 5ater"" to our parents.

&nbsp;

Then you just removed 41k of what i spent, so you end up with ~25k 

I think this is the minimum average to spend. 

&nbsp;

Keep in mind that i didn't do a ""mbita/7enna"" because i dont like those either, instead I went with 17 of my friends (all boys) we rented a very big chalet somewhere outside Benzart for 3 days, and it was basically a private festival, food, alcohol, weed, music, pool, good nature, etc.. that is the ""ba3be3i"" part in the sheets lol

&nbsp;

I ended up doing the ""3ché"" though which is the equivilant of ""7enna/mbita"" but i didn't give a single Dannous there, my family covered it, i think it costed ~4k or something. 


&nbsp;

My wife also didn't do ""wteyya"", instead she just did the ""7ammem"" thingy with her friends and some family members, I think it costed ~2k. 


----

Obligatory sad-political reminder that :

25k tnd is barely 7.5K euro...

I hope this help.

First of all, that security guard needs an ass whooping for making such advancements towards you.  
Second, there's no laws preventing anybody from having anyone over at their home (I learned that after being harassed for months). The law most of us are/were paranoid about only concerns premarital intercourse and you have to actually get caught butt naked to be tried and convicted (do a quick search and read about it yourself if you want).  
Also, the police do not care about couples even if they knew you were having sex (I also learned that after months of living hell). It's too big of a hassle for nothing so they don't even bother unless there's narcotics involved or a hint of prostitution then they will start investigating.  
If you act scared, you're facilitating your own harassment. The security guard could have relationships with a few corrupt officers that he could use to harass you or your boyfriend (in my case he kept asking for money) when you guys aren't even doing anything wrong to begin with.

Obviously.

Even if you both don't know you can practise together. (After marriage obviously)

> and how can I show affection to a Tunisian girl without making her uncomfortable? 

You gotta take a decision, you said you pray in the mosque in another comment. Are you going to choose to go against God's words for your lust or someone's lust or are you going to focus on doing right?

As for the generalised idea, some do and some don't but the ones they do (basically the ones that don't care about religion and/or their family's values and just follow their lusts), do it in private. Even married couples do it in private, it's also haram to be a cuck and display your woman for others to lust over like that (just like porn basically).",2024-01-06 13:08:50

That's why I called it pseudophilosophy, we dealt with our economics the same way a redditor who comments without reading the entire post does. We never tried an entirely capitalist or an entirely communist regime.. -not that I suggest we do-
We just go after snippets and highlights, hoping our circle fits in the square. 


The problem of the government with their policies is the same as the people with their career choices.. «just try what is trending half heatedly then cry about it not working out.» 

It's an unsettling irony.

We speak Arabic at home, my daughters understand most. But can’t speak a lot really. And we’re not connected to many Tunisians where I live, so kind of on our own. If they don’t speak Arabic at home they don’t do so at all. Cuz the other Arab friends we have - non-Tunisians - speak different dialects which is a different language to our kids than the one their parents speak to them (us, parents). 

So it’s completely understandable that those 2nd or 3rd generation Tunisians who are born and raised abroad are much more comfortable discussing topics in French instead of the often very basic Arabic they only heard at home.

Maybe because this Subreddit is not the right place to ask for fatwa? Right?

&#x200B;

But anyways, let me help you with this question...

According to Islam, [it's totally halal for wife to even suck your cock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpIqzjGkmg). Since oral sex is of course halal, you can conclude that kissing would be halal as well.

Don't worry. This type of horny questions is very often asked on Islamic Fatwa websites and on Youtube.

Although, OP,  asking about islam in Tunisia's sub reddit is not the best way to do it even though you might get an answer. I recommend starting a habit of going to the mosque (if you don't do it already) and asking trusted knowledgeable imam for Islamic Knowledge.
You can also get informations from islamqa.info

To work legally, you need a legal framework:

* you can be resident in the country of your employer, and then you'll need to pay taxes in this country

* you can be solely resident in Tunisia. And in that case you need to create a company (entreprise personnelle is the simplest form) and export your services to your employer (so they will be paying you fees rather than a salary). Taxes in Tunisia are generally lower than European and American states, and you get particularly favorable treatment as a société totalement exportatrice (a good accounting firm would help you create your company and take advantage of all tax cut opportunities in Tunisia).",2024-01-06 11:10:11

kgkikgm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/18zwxzy/capitalism_hit_tunisians_as_a_pseudophilosophy/kgkikgm/,3,"Tunisia is a tutorial level country. No economic policy was implemented here with the best interest in mind. By that I mean with full consideration of the characteristics that made this land (historically) an attractive boon to conquer. It's a successive shuffling of multiple copycat economic ""reforms"" from other shitholes. Remember the communist experiment? Then we were quasi-socialist. Or not? I could chalk this up to top down buffoonery from the people warming up executive offices, but no that's not.. it? Everyone agrees that our cabinet in the 70's/80's were comprised of relatively competent people. Not competent enough to put off a bread revolution thoughever. Not competent enough to prevent the planting of the seeds that would later lead to the dismantlement of multiple native industries in favor of transitioning the economy to a pseudo-service economy. 

The most hysterical facet to observe is seeing genuienly sound policies, breed incremental dismantlement of Tunisian fabric of society. See the literacy boom of the 1960's, 70's, 80's. The ""ten7iyet le9mal"" campaign. This uncontested success of our post colonial governments, was taking a virtually agrarian, middle-ages tier society and forcefully marching them all into the 20th century. Fuck. Me. We had internet before a majority of the Latin speaking world. We had institutionalized edicts that incur beheadings in certain world regions. We had settled debates that still plague parts of the first world (eg abortion). We moonwalked into globalization ass first ready for a good decent rape. 

The result is... curiously enough, not that different from the countries we'd tried to emulate. An over-""educated"" (formally of course) populace. A saturated local market, overflooded with degrees from wherever with whatever inscription engraved on top. Did you know that 40% of tenured public sector employees got in (post 2011) with forged certificates? Of course you didn't know that because I just pulled that number out of my ass. That doesn't make that queer fact any less queer and any less true and any less sickening frankly. 

That's what makes our localized recession even more insidious. The dishonesty, slyness, corruption, not those no. Those are global vices, and they are present in most post-industrial advanced countries. It's the lawlessness. Tunisia is a lawless country. It's not a capitalist hellscape, or an immoral hovel of un-islamic practices. Tunisia is **lawless.** Tunisia is the proverbial 21st century mini-me wild west. It props up institutions under the guise of enforcing the law. But does it? It stalls. It procrastinates. It pretends to execute some form of the law. ""It"" (being the powers that be lmao) tries to straddle the middle ground so steadfastly, by placating everyone and their mother that the law becomes moot. The law is an ornament. It's the cosmetic operation with which we hope to not get clocked as a  ""pretend"" country. 

Anyways, what was the og goalpost? Oh, yeah. People are le people. They'll do anything to ensure their stability (financial, etc) and unfortunately, that could come with at the cost of some (also man made) ideals like national identity. Tunisia has been relatively inhospitable even prior to the revolution. (inb4 no life was le good. You were a kid, probably middle cl\*ss). It is what it is. People yejriw wra l5obza since circa 1970. That's why every Tunisian family had that one distant (or close) uncle who immigrated to rebuild France post ww2 in the days where the green passport was a respected nifty document. It's not ideological. It's not cultural. It's a perennial strife for survival by accumulating wealth. It's human nature.",2024-01-06 10:56:23

Super, ca me fait plaisir, je te souhaite beaucoup de courage dans ta reprise. C'est pas facile ! Perso j'apprend l'arabe littéraire actuellement. j'ai 2h de cours par semaine + duolingo, et je visite de temps en temps le site arabic toons qui a pleins de dessins animés ou ils parlent en arabe littéraire parce que c'est impossible de trouver serie ou film dans ce language. Pour ce qui est du tunisien j'ai deja une base du fait de grandir avec une mère tunisienne. La difficulté a été d'arrêter de lui répondre en français et commencer a lui repondre en tunisien, quitte a se prendre quelques petites moqueries gentilles mais découragentes de la famille qui te dit que tu parle comme un touriste. A force tu va absorber l'accent aussi. Donc c'est sur la pratique orale que je me concentre, avec ma maman et mon oncle principalement. De plus, j'ai un livre assez amusant qui s'appelle ""Parler tunisien fissa !"" qui pretend pouvoir t'apprendre le tunisien a raison de 30 mins par jour dessus, squi est une grossière exagération. Mais qui se révèle etre assez utile ! Pour ce qui est film, il y a un site qui s'appelle Artify ou tu peux louer des films tunisiens pour des prix absolument dérisoires (3e le film). GROS hic, il n'y a pas de sous titres en francais. En fait, yen a jamais. Comme les productions tunisiennes et plus largement du monde arabe ne s'exportent pas en France, tu peux rien trouver avec des sous titres francais, vu que c'est le pays exportant qui s'en charge. C'est super mega frustrant parce que je pensais aussi que passer par les films et les series pourrait m'aider a apprendre le tunisien. Les series tunisiennes sont encore moins accessibles lol. Meme des series légendaires tunisiennes comme ""choufli 7hal"" n'ont toujours pas été traduites alors qu'elles datent. Pas de chance de ce coté. Je n'ai pas exploré youtube mais tu pourrais surement y trouver des vidéos qui t'apprennent pas le tunisien en entier mais quelques expressions. Sinon, en cherchant quelque chose l'autre fois je suis tombé sur un compte tiktok qui s'apelle tkallem tounsi qui fait de courtes vidéos ou il t'apprend des mots et des expressions tunisiennes et leur prononciations. Manque de chance, tu peux pas faire pause sur tiktok ?!? Quand tu finis une vidéo ca enchaine sur une autre direct ?!? Quel enfer ! Impossible de prendre des notes. Mais si tu es un utilisateur de cette platforme ca pourrait t'interesser. Voila, j'espère avoir pu t'aider en partageant mes ressources actuelles. Il faut pratiquer pratiquer pratiquer ! Si tu a le temps je suggère aussi d'apprendre l'arabe littéraire. Je sais pas si je le conseille en meme temps car entre ca et l'argo tunisien ya un monde et tu mélange un peu tout hahah. Mais savoir parler sans écrire c'est assez embarassant. Qui plus est apprendre a lire l'arabe t'aiderait a regarder des films et series tunisiennes sous titré en arabe ce qui serait plus accessible ! Bon courage ya rhouya !",2024-01-08 00:37:43

I was born and raised in Tunisia, but I am half european. I grew up in an upper middle-class circle (relatively wealthy, but not Ferrari wealthy) in a relatively well educated and cultured environment (private schools, elite schools, private music lessons, frequent travel, etc...). So, like most people in my social circle, I went to study in Europe after finishing school (bac), and it was not that common at that time (I am quite old). For some reasons, I didn't go to France to study, but to another european country, even though I have a tight connection with France its culture.

Like most foreign students in Europe, I was mostly hanging out with other foreign students from all around the world, but most of us were pretty much from the same social class, and at that time I was not aware of that concept of ""social class"". I already knew in Tunisia that I was ""different"" and some people hated me for no apparent reason, but I never did the match.

When I went to Europe, I noticed that my middle eastern friends (turks, iranians, lebanese) never hang out with their fellow countrymen from the diaspora, even on the same campus. I didn't understand why, until I got to know a few diaspora tunisians and I made my own experience.

My experience with diaspora tunisians was also my first experience with xenophobia and racism. They assumed, that I was stupid, uneducated, and greedy, just by projecting the same characteristics of their cousins back home on me, and when they realize that I did not fit those stereotypes, they got really angry and switched to another kind of exclusion game by constantly joking about my ""exotic"" aspect. They were just constantly saying: _""tunisians suck, but we know you are not like most of them.""_ and I was really sad to see how those people who are at the very bottom of the foodchain both in Tunisia and Europe were desperately looking for somebody else to let their accumulated frustrations on.

When I talked with my turkish and iranian friends about that, they just laughed at me and told me _""you should never hang out with goat fucker kids.""_ and I sadly have to admit: they were right.

Since then, I made my opinion about working class immigrant kids, and found my peace of mind in avoiding them.",2024-01-07 23:28:26

Arab Jews have existed for a long time no one is denying that. What we are saying is that the state of Israel , the colonial Zionist state of Israel, does not have a long rich history.

Majority of the ppl of Egypt today are descendants of the people of ancient Egypt who built the pyramids and are features on the wall art. Egyptians today got hellenized during the Greco/Roman era which did not replace the Egyptian population but it did involve a lot of mixing with Greek people. That mixing still makes them the descendants of the ancient Egyptians as no one got eradicated or exterminated. Arabization did not exterminate Egyptians either. It replaced the administration language of the day which was Greek with Arabic and brought in Arab culture in the region which got indigenized over time with native traditions. Arabs never exterminated any of the original populations they arabized. So this contradicts your  statement that it is only the Coptic and Bedouins who are direct descendants.,2024-01-07 23:03:27

kgssdkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/191255d/your_view_about_tunisians_born_abroad/kgssdkl/,1,"Salut ! 

Merci pour ce long commentaire, superbement bien rédigé par ailleurs. J'aurais bien répondu en tunisien mais de un ce n'est pas forcément évident par écrit, de deux il m'est plus difficile d'utiliser le tunisien pour exprimer des pensées complexes ! 

Je comprends pour les clichés, des deux côtés. Oui, moi-même je dois bien admettre avoir des vues plutôt conservatrices et être tourné vers la spiritualité. Il faut bien comprendre que nos parents ont émigré en France il y a plusieurs décennies (les miens dans les années 70 !) en quête de perspectives économiques. Il n'y avait pas internet, whatsapp ou je ne sais quoi, ils pouvaient se sentir isolés et ont passé des moments très difficiles loin des leurs... Quand tu es isolé, tu te raccroches à ce que tu peux : l'image du pays que tu as laissé, tes croyances religieuses... c'était tout ce qu'ils avaient. Voilà donc pourquoi on est peut-être un peu plus imprégné de certaines valeurs ""d'autrefois"", nous qui avons grandi à l'étranger. 

Par conséquent il y a parfois un décalage entre les Tunisiens de l'étranger et les Tunisiens Tunisiens, c'est vrai. Mais je pense que globalement ça peut bien se passer quand chacun se respecte. Car le jugement peut venir de certains faisant la morale religieuse aux gens là-bas, je suis d'accord, mais il peut aussi être dans l'autre sens avec les locaux qui se ""moquent"" des zimigris ne boivent pas, ne sortent pas en boîte et font la prière, et qui pensent tout savoir mieux sous prétexte qu'ils ont grandi dans un pays musulman en Tunisie. Perso j'ai jamais fait la morale tant qu'on respecte mes choix personnels. 

&#x200B;

> De plus il y a l'idée que les natifs vont automatiquement essayer de profiter des leurs compatriotes en demandant argent etc sans limites. 

Moi-même je m'en veux d'avoir eu cette image pendant longtemps, surtout à cause de mauvaises expériences personnelles. Mais en même temps j'ai aussi appris à relativiser ce point, ne le prends pas mal : et si c'était vrai, serait-ce mal ? Je veux dire, beaucoup de zimigris ont pris l'habitude de flamber en Tunisie, laissant croire aux locaux qu'ils ont beaucoup de moyens même quand ce n'est pas forcément le cas. Or, un moment donné, quand on va en Tunisie il faut aussi tenir compte du contexte économique des gens et de l'image qu'on transmet, et qu'à titre personnel si je vivais en Tunisie, dans un village, et que je voyais des gens chaque été se ramener avec des vêtements  et des appareils tape à l'œil et bien j'aurais été un ""profiteur"" peut-être. 

&#x200B;

> Aussi, les tunisiens à l'étranger sont aussi pas super chauds à l'idée de se faire des potes tunisiens ailleurs car ils ont peur que ceux-ci parlent de leur modes de vies à leur famille au pays, etc. Étant moi-même tunisien en france, on s'évite de pzur de se faire juger voir de devoir rendre des comptes si on se fait balancer. Bon généralement si les deux sont sur la même longueur d'ondes l'amitié devient possible 

Je comprends mieux, d'un seul coup, ça fait sens 😆",2024-01-07 22:40:05

So yes, lot of French-Tunisian are way more fluent in french than tunisian, to say things kindly.  That being said, I absolutely don't want to blame others, but responsabilty also comes from : 

\- Parents : lot of parents of North-African ethnicity are partly french speakers. So a lot talked french to their kids instead of fully talking them into proper dialect (and arabic, more generally), like other communities do (Portuguese, Chinese...). The thing is I even see young parents nowadays, with both rencently immigrated, who still do this and don't talk tunisian to their babies. 

\- Familly : when your cousins do talk french and clearly say ""talk french, your tunisian s\*ck"" instead actually helping you improving, well you end with a very bellow average level. Not saying EVERYBODY was like this, but that was pretty common.

Alors, les relations entre ""natifs"" et ""nés à l'étranger"" (aussi appellé zmigri) est , comme tu l'as décrite, assez ""je t'aime moi non plus"".
Je vais essayer de faire un résumé concis

Les natifs perçoient les zmigris comme arrogant, hypocrites, et très jugemental. Cela vient du fait que certains zmigris ont un comportement plus que problématique une fois en tunisie, n'hésitant pas à se plaindre à tout va voir de faire des leçons de morales aux locaux, notamment sur la religion( les zmigris SONT BEAUCOUP PLUS CONSERVATEURS que les natifs) ou certains aspects. Aussi plusieurs personnes candidates à l'émigration en France ont cru avoir de la famille en france mais ce sont fait lâcher par ceux-ci une fois arrivé en france... Tu ajoutes à cela simplement le rejet de la différence des autres. Pour autant les natifs vont être très généralement accueillants et vont soutenir les tunisiens de l'étranger.

Ceux nés en France voient généralement les natifs comme arriérés, bledards, profiteurs et indigne de confiances. Il y a toujours un sentiment que les natifs sont en retard sur certains points, voir qu'ils refusent la ""civilisation"". De plus il y a l'idée que les natifs vont automatiquement essayer de profiter des leurs compatriotes en demandant argent etc sans limites. Les zmigris percoivent aussi les natifs comme impies car n'étant pas assez islamique à leur yeux

Bon, il y a tellement de clichés entre les deux populations qui n'ont pas été cités, mais c'était justz pour illustrer le fait les visions et préjugés que les uns ont sur les autres. 

Aussi, les tunisiens à l'étranger sont aussi pas super chauds à l'idée de se faire des potes tunisiens ailleurs car ils ont peur que ceux-ci parlent de leur modes de vies à leur famille au pays, etc. Étant moi-même tunisien en france, on s'évite de pzur de se faire juger voir de devoir rendre des comptes si on se fait balancer. Bon généralement si les deux sont sur la même longueur d'ondes l'amitié devient possible",2024-01-07 21:44:28

One of them is that Tunisians from France don't bother to learn tounsi.

Half of what the Hafsids controlled isn't even part of Tunisia today. Do the people of Western Libya and Eastern Algeria not also have a claim to the legacy of the Hafsids ? And technically parts of Southern Tunisia (especially around Tozeur and Kebili) weren't under their control, are they not part of your Tunisian nation then ?

If such an ""essential era of the Tunisian nation"" included people you don't deem as Tunisian and excluded people you deem as Tunisian, wouldn't you say calling it ""Tunisian"" is rather inaccurate ?

>Nation has no accurate translation to Arabic as it was newly introduced to the Arab sphere from foreign sources. Ummah is a broad term indicating a ""supranational"" society like the islamic Ummah.. we cant discuss modern concepts with irrelevant terms like Ummah.

The term Ummah has been used to mean Nation in an Arabic-speaking context for the last 200 years already. ""Al Ummah al 3arabiya"", ""Al Ummah al Masriya"", ""Al Ummah al Tunisiya"" were all terms frequently used by pan-Arabists and anti-colonial activists all through the last century and the one before it. Ummah doesn't indicate a ""supranational society"", you are referring to what is commonly referred to as ""Al Ummah"" or ""THE Ummah"" which people usually mean as ""the Islamic nation"" (with the connotation of the existence of a united Islamic sense of nationhood that transcends political borders).

kgrovoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1908gcu/just_got_back_from_tunisia_wow/kgrovoc/,1,"> • stop playing on words, being zionists means supporting the state of israel and its settlers over a land that isn’t theirs, 

Being Zionist means supporting the jewish people’s right to self determination, without which we would not exist as a people. That’s it. Not supporting Zionism means you don’t support the right of Jewish people to self determine, which would result in the genocide of our people. 

Of course - there are different sub-groups of Zionists within that umbrella term. Some of them support the settlements. I am not one of those people, nor are most of the American Zionists I know irl. 

>tunisia don’t support this and this has nothing to do with being jewish, we have one of the biggest jewish communities of the world and even a space of jewish pilgrimage located in djerba, if you go over there i bet you are going to find a lot of zionists like you, if that’s what you’re looking for.

That’s why I had two people in this thread reprimanded not by the mods of this sub - but by Reddit admins themselves - for threatening me with anti semitic Jewish stereotypes and violence?

> tunisian people are literally one of the most open minded people of the MENA 💀 

I believe you, in most regards. I’ve seen a lot of welcoming people on this sub the last few months when Reddit has for some reason been putting it in my feed five times a day. The exception to that is with regard to queer people and Jews. 

> but of course you have to take in consideration the history of the country you’re visiting. there are still people with different mindsets or homophobic people, you can’t do anything against that except doing what you gotta do with your girlfriend in private or in clubs that are lgbtq friendly. but i still think that it wont be a problem if you kiss your gf in public touristic areas, no one is gonna throw punches at you. as a queer tunisian, i can tell you myself that if i had to choose an arab country for my safety as a queer person i’d still choose tunisia

Most of that is really good to hear. Thanks for sharing your experience. 

> you literally can’t assume what people in tunisia think about queer people, just look at this sub and the number of queers/open minded ppl

I’m trying not to assume, that’s why I’m asking! So far I’ve had 2 threats, one of them was a violent threat. 

> yes you will be treated like a friend but bro this happens in most of the countries of the world💀 don’t act surprised

Unfortunately that hasn’t been my experience in most parts of the world. People *really* hate Jews. But I’m glad to hear you don’t think I would experience the same things I’ve seen on this sub irl! Perhaps Reddit just attracts extremists.",2024-01-07 19:04:56

In tunisia if parents are easy, then they are very easy, but if they're strict, then they are very very strict, you don't really find in betweens. And if you try to change a strict parent's opinion (especially dads) then you basically have no chance whatsoever. Arabic dads are strict, but Tunisian dads are something else. If you try introducing yourself you'll not only fail but probably get humiliated, and that's not because her father is a bad person but he probably just cares so much about his daughter... All Tunisians are like this. And btw if you try to introduce yourself your relationship with her is gonna basically end, he'll just prevent her from ever being able to contact you so you'll just end everything like this.  
What you can really do though is count on her, cause not only is she the only one that has any chances of convincing him but if she tells him that she wants to choose who she wanna marry then she'll probably be able to convince him. As for you though you can only convince her to convince him and try to encourage her as much as possible. That's all you can really do.  
Hopefully you reach your desired relationship though, wish you luck (;

I did leave Germany in the end (to the disapproval and disappointment of almost every person I know) and came back home. Now I feel much happier. 

Even the louage thing, something I took for granted before my stay in Germany, now has a special flavor and I savior it as well as all the other “small things” that I couldn’t find in europe. And yeah, you can never be alone in Tunisia, no one will leave you be 😄

2/ Swiping the second national language from French to English is not a solution as people don’t manage to master French already, let alone English. I am bilingual in French and English, it only brought me opportunities and an ability to speak and learn faster Latin languages such as Spanish.

3/ Liberalize law: good but it needs to be done smoothly if you don’t want social unrest.

4/ Lower taxes and cracking down on the black market: the black market is big because the government is unable to boost economic prosperity in some areas, it represents 60% of the economy given the latest figures. You need to get them into the formal economy, not cracking down on them because you can’t.

5/ Low interest mortgage: It bolsters inflation. You just can’t do something like that in Tunisia if you know basic economic playbooks. If you want to implement such measure, you need to reduce the inflation at a 2% threshold. We constantly had at least 5% inflation every year since 2017.

6/ Create a new economic capital ? Egypt has this idea and its economic return is very uncertain. We already have 3 large cities with a high amount of human capital. Let’s try to invest in the infrastructures there.

 7/ Fund new startups ? I am 100% supportive of startup nations but Tunisia cannot already manage to attract standard companies. How will you attract VCs if there is no even 24/7 electricity and water in some suburbs of Tunis, the economic capital.

8/ Create a free market economy? I am in favor and this is a very hard move politicians need to do. This will create social unrest and this is necessary in my view.

9/ People hate intellectuals in this country. We are seen as parasites working for “western” powers. For many people we embody what they hate: the upper class. Having a good situation, being happy and proactive, not setting for mediocrity is something not liked among many of our fellow citizens. That’s why this country may never see ambitious/forward-looking leaders.

1. The hammamet area is not that big, while there are taxis you can get most places by foot. If you need it though taxis are everywhere and not that expensive. If you intend on getting far from hammamet like nabeul you can take “Louage” which are privately owned collective taxis that have designated spots for every city (you can ask your taxi driver to take you to the louage station)

Most people speak french on a semi fluent level but basic English should get you what you need.

Google maps works just fine for everything except for public transport.

2. For actual Tunisian cuisine you’re better off trying it in Nabeul to immerse yourself in local culture, but then again options are available in Hammamet too.

3. The amusement parks / the medina / yasmine hammamet / the port / the old city / thats as far as my knowledge goes

4. Hammamet is very touristy, thus more on the safe side. Use common sense and you should be okay.

Some Keywords you use regarding the economy are interesting tho - and they sound very neoliberal, which i think CAN be very dangerous for a country like Tunisia.

Because while neoliberal policies may foster economic growth in some contexts, applying them indiscriminately in an undeveloped small country can lead to heigh inequality and increased economic instability. A balanced approach considering the unique challenges of the country is crucial for SUSTAINABLE economic development.

The danger lies in the potential erosion of the country's economic and political independence, as neoliberal policies may inadvertently expose it to foreign interests and control, hindering its ability to shape its own developmental trajectory.

I am against neoliberal policies. I believe the right approach is in the political center. There are sectors where liberal policies are neccecary and appropriate  - though extreme caution is necessary to protect the local economy, especially for a small country. Additionally, there are sectors and crucial assets that should be in state hands. I am aware that the government currently fails in this regard. 

The solution should be to improve and combat the corruption. While this may be more challenging than just privatization, it is undoubtedly more sustainable and in the interest of the people.",2024-01-07 17:31:54

There were a lot of kingdoms in north western Saudi arabia who were engaged with Mesopotamia & levant civilizations in trade & wars.

A lot of kingdoms in eastern Saudi Arabia that was engaged with Persia & Mesopotamia. Same with southern & central KSA.

One of my favorite experiences was when I tried to enter a mosque, actually. I was denied entry by the guard. I am not a Muslim, I understand. But, a man stood up and defended me, saying that ""all should be welcome into this place, this man should be allowed to learn our religion"" to which the guard clearly did not care. 

A few minutes later, the iman of this mosque came out and talked with me. He explained that, understandably, this is a holy mosque and that non-Muslims are not allowed inside. He then explained to me a lot about the religion, which my local friend I was traveling with translated for me for a solid 15-20 minutes. 

After that, the man who stood up for me showed us around the area - Monastir. We had tea, we explored various areas, et cetera.

kgpvmpa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/190okmf/job_offer_in_saudi_arabia/kgpvmpa/,31,"Salary is quite low.

I just left saudi arabia for good, after trying my best to find a job there. I was met with salaries like this, and i rejected them all. 

due to many reasons.

1- Job security: there is no job security in Saudi arabia specially for foreigners and Arabs specifically. Saudization laws are being struck yearly and you just have to put your hand on your heart everytime you open twitter/X when a new law is on.

\- if there is a saudi national who comes to apply to be an english teacher at your school, and sees you. the school might push you out unethically.

&#x200B;

2- Renewals: I dont think this will come as an issue during your contract, specially if they give you two years IQAMA instantly (if they give you 1 year IQAMA it might be a hassle to renew it if the school wants to let you go). 

\- If you decided to leave the school to go find another job (given that the school allows you to do that), you are looking at a very competitive market that millions of foreigners are looking for jobs, especially now with the Sudan situation and other Arab nations problems they all flooded the job market.

\- Also if your IQAMA expires, you would need to find Kafeel and everything you made or saved up during your employment will be returned back to KSA and Kafeel.

How ? 2000 transfer IQAMA fees

9800 SAR to renew the IQAMA

1000 SAR for health insurance (must and cheapest)

400\~500 SAR per month for the Kafeel.

Oh and transportation in Saudi is expensive and the public system is new and extremely unreliable.

so you would need a car which would cost you 20k upwards. and you cant own a car without saudi driving license.

and driving license would cost you from 1000 SAR to 3000 and more, including transportation back and forth.

3- Slavery: going in the Kafalah of the school or a kafeel is like marriage, if they are good then you are very very lucky and if they are bad then you will be miserable.

\- say you decided to go outside of KSA, you need to be allowed by your employer to leave in the system. you cant just get your passport and leave.

\- even if you leave saudi for good you need allowance from the employer or the Kafeel.

&#x200B;

4- diminishing economy: The economy is not what it looks like from the outside, it is actually pretty bad, and you can feel it. the people foreigners and citizens alike are not liking it here, everything is getting more expensive and the income is not changed.

&#x200B;

\- unemployment rate amongst Saudi people are high and the govt is trying to kick foreigners and replacing them with locals. so you might see locals on twitter ranting about foreigners.

&#x200B;

5- weather: the weather is extremely hot you cant imagine it until you come here. it is bad period, going to the south the weather might be better but it can get extremely cold and it sucks.

&#x200B;

Think of your end goal. You’re going to a country where you won’t save with that salary and you know a country like Saudi can never be your end game because the day your contract isn’t renewed you’re out within a week. And since your employer is your immigration sponsor you won’t be able to change a job. It’s also not a pleasant country like poor asian countries where expats spend 2 years of their lives getting paid next to nothing but at least exploring a culture and enjoying it. So ask yourself is it worth it? Hell fucking no! Tutor english in Tunisia and you’ll make much more than that.

The French got their Napoléon, the English got their Oliver Cromwell, we got out Kais Said.

It is disappointing for sure, but not totally strange. 

What we have in particular compared to the other examples I cited is the fact that our Ceasar/Emperor/Lord Protector is utterly incompetent. Like totally ill-equipped to anything related to the matters of the State. In that, I think he reflects:

* the level of understanding and clarity of the majority of the population in Tunisia.

* a mentality that is maybe a cultural specificity: we trust the incompetent more. We think that the incompetent will be unable of taking advantage of the system. Both the political spectrum and the average Tunisian trusted KS because they knew he had no experience.


So yeah, of course the Tunisian population is absolutely responsible of what is happening right now in Tunisia. But maybe the utter incompetence of our newly appointed king is a blessing in disguise: it is a bitter lesson to learn, but a useful lesson: no individual should have all the power nor be responsible of fiding the solutions of all the problems. 

I have little to no hope that the 55 years and + people in Tunisia would be able to understand this lesson, as clearly their mind is to influenced by the nostalgia towards the ""blessed Era"" of ""competent depots"" like Zaba and Bourguiba. But I do have hope for younger generations.

If the answer to any of that is that I would be treated differently if it were a queer relationship - then I wouldn’t feel comfortable in the country. 

I had to decide where to have my honeymoon based on the laws around queer people. Some international hotels wouldn’t let my ex wife and I have the honeymoon suite (for our *honeymoon*!) or were very concerned about us being visibly queer in front of children.

I'll pre-answer some of the things people will ask/think:

**What about other products where imports increased?** 

They're all locally produced and their production went down significantly so while imports increased it doesn't mean it was not enough to cover the deficit.

Here's [figures](https://www.oc.com.tn/ar/%d8%aa%d9%82%d8%af%d9%91%d9%85-%d8%b9%d9%85%d9%84%d9%8a%d8%a9-%d8%aa%d8%ac%d9%85%d9%8a%d8%b9-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%ad%d8%a8%d9%88%d8%a8-%d8%b9%d9%84%d9%89-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b5%d8%b9%d9%8a%d8%af-%d8%a7-10/) from Office des Cereales. They actually incorrectly labelled 2023 as 2022 and vice versa (I'll pretend that's not intentional) but local production went down to less than half of last year. For ble dur, the decrease amounted to 3600000 quintal = 360000 tons. We can't simply calculate the expected impact compared to the first 9 months because the government got to use the 2022 production in those months. 

Local production of sugar accounts to close to half of needs and it's been going down recently. Potatoes production tanked after farmers stopped producing them because they were being arrested last year for keeping them in freezers to sell out of season. Milk production tanked after the government refused to raise prices and people started selling cattle. 

**We produce ble tendre/farina** 

We do but it's negligeable. It's about 5% compared to ble dur and last year there was almost 0 production in ble tendre in 2023 so decreasing its imports is even more blatant proof of causing shortages. This is also the real reason why they want to make bread with ble dur because ble tendre is imported.",2024-01-08 22:21:04

a question though ,why you are only looking  in Tunisia?

i am a data  analyst in Belgium but started with several internships (first Tunisia then Ukraine and finally Netherlands), i can help you out if you want to be more efficient. by checking your CV, helping with cover letter and make a proper plan even beyond the internship, i think the end goal is not the internship itself, it should be a station to land a job you like.

As for mansions, in grand Tunis is unreasonably expensive (haut standing appartment s+2 goes up to 400k dt in a good neighborhood), if you build you own and KEEP AN EYE on the construction deal, I think it'd be a better option 400k can build you a castle.

French people 
Tunisian french people 
Tunisians that idolize french culture. 

French people: French people are known around the globe to be pretentious (especially parisians). They display arrogance because of the so called western values. The western philosophy implicitly states that western values are the best and are a synonym for progress and class. So basically whenever they go they try to implement these values and often complain about how locals do not adopt their ideas and their way of living. Therefore they couldn't grasp the basic idea that we are very different from each other as human beings but can accept our differences and respect other cultures. We all saw how french complained about how qatar not allowing alcohol in the world cup. I will also share that the year my mom decided to start wearing hijab they kicked her from a swimming pool in a Tunisian hotel because some french people felt unsafe. ( go figure that out). I am not generalizing on the french population but usually these incidents makes the masses adopt a certain point of view.

Tunisian french: I think everyone here highlighted in a good way how constantly doing comparisons and telling tunisians what they should do and what they should not do would actually make you unwanted in the party. We are not the typical bledard in paris that says wesh yal khou every 3 seconds, have no respect to his surrounding and lazy as fuck. And we do not like people whom gives this image about us. Whether tunisians born abroad or Tunisian immigrant. 

Tunisians that idolize french culture: basically same as Tunisian french people but this guy visited france for tourism. Speaks only french or 80% of his words are french. Believes that tunisian dialect is tgou3ir and Tunisian culture (religion or aspects that doesn't have to do with religion) are low level. To them, being educated in tunisian programs is equivalent to not being educated. Usually they put their children in french programs schools in tunisia. You'll find them usually around el marsa. I lived in marsa for 3 years I can only say that marsa is full of authentic Tunisian history, architecture, culture and Oh ACCENT. That place is amazing but unfortunately there are incentives to make it ""frenchy"". I would welcome some change to be honest but it shouldn't be the norm to a point it makes our rich amazing culture devalued. 

I would wrap all this up by saying that you are Tunisian. You don't need validation from tunisians to be one. If you make the efforts it would be very appreciated. If you try to embrace the culture you ll be mesmerized (تذوق تحصل). A lot of tunisians actually start to appreciate our details only when they leave the country. 

That being said we are not perfect and we have a lot of work to do in order to change ourselves and create a strong connection with our identity and culture. Searching ourselves in foreign countries is not a solution and eventually we need to thrive as a country no matter the cost. It is not an option anymore. And I am sure that your grandparents/parents would love to see tunisia a better and stronger country and I am sure that they would never leave it if it was. At least, I know I would never leave it. 

There may come a time when France doesn't accept you for who you are but Tunisia will always embrace you. 🇹🇳",2024-01-08 19:40:02

I get your point, those who lived abroad are a little bit more ""conservative"" and may think they are superior. I don't. But don't do like local Tunisians are absolute fans of immigration themselves. Sometimes just talking about immigration saved me when I had nothing to say, and the other person had A LOT to say about it 😅🤣",2024-01-08 16:11:06

The way of thinking, the way to talk (yes i'm more introverted, in Tunisia being very  extrovert and straightforward is encouraged for men, I admire you for that haha).

Yes, we come and dont live reality of Tunisia. But at the same time I would not consider myself as a tourist :  go to see familly, stayed in our house or familly's house, kid K stayed months in immersion in ""houma"", buying grosseries to the ""hanout"" and eating ""cloub"" with cousins and other kids of the neighboorhood. Enjoyed staying on villas as much as I enjoyed old houses, ""dar arbi"" 😆 Nearly never stayed at the hotel or any very touristic area in Tunisia. Ofc summer is ideal because that's when we have hollydays and we go to the beach, however I came several times on March/April and I just loved the vibe so much. Much much more authentic !!!!

Except few long-trun empire, all countries have been influenced by colonization, and at a certain point we were the colonizers, so, that's not an excuse.

Politics:

- serious democratic backsliding, major concentration of powers in the presidency and no checks or balances, weak state institutions, endangered judicial independence (the minister of justice under presidential orders is meddling in the judiciary), arbitrary political regime with unclear prerogatives, growing restrictions on freedoms, extreme populism + conspiract theorists + paranoia (you are either pro-president or a traitor to the people), growing diplomatic isolation, opposition leaders in jail for malicious charges, restrictions on media and civil society, journalists in prison...

Economics:

- Stagflation + unemployment + increasing debts + low credit rating (Fitch and Moodys) + increasing taxes + considerable reducation in public investments + inadequately big state budget + random shortages touching some products (local production is doing down simultanously with reduction in imports) + serious agricultural decline + small and medium entreprizes dying in a serious rate

Well, a youtuber ot tiktoker is not exactly ""Western media"".

The thing is, Western media is not a single homogenous entity. It's plural. You can find all kind of opinions. There are pro-Palestine news outlets and there are pro-Israel news outlets.

to be honest as a tunisian born here , i share you with you looks and physical similiarities ( if both your parents are tunisian ; there is a big chance you don't have blue eyes and blond hair which not common in here) and even that is not a really reliable criteria 

we don't speak the same language ; our thoughts are mostly not the same given the enviornment you greew up in 

education not the  same 

culture not the same 

you come to tunisia in summers , so does other tourists 

you are tunisian on paper yeah you are more than welcome in the country because legally it is yours and no one can take that away from you

For Punic history, first, we use more Carthaginian instead of Punic, except for the wars, they are called Punic wars, as you said, Punic is a Roman word, which I think (not sure) means Phoenician, may be Romans never wanted to acknowledge the distinction between the two civilization, or may be they were never considered as distinct and that Carthaginian empire was a continuity of the Phoenician civilisation, I don't know.

&#x200B;

The youth is certainally the future and we are nto including them in the process of revitalizing the society especially with """"""supreme leader"""""" KS  bringing ideas out of the 60s. I believe the future will be grim to our youth, where we will apply the ""motherland"" mentality and we work them out completely just to keep them poor and outdated (literally work harder to stay poor).

I think the currently open market in IT, should be the way out for most youth but the goverment is not capitalizing on it, it's not trying to gain anything from the wild west of mobile apps and generated data, which proves it's glaring stupidity and it's short sight and especially it's incompetence in proiding or the future generations.   


in the ben ali era we had a ""sovereign fund"" in some way called the ""youth account"" but they didn't put it into good use, probably as the goverment was so coorked they forgot their main purpose of prospering the nation to which we pay taxes to.   


I believe digitilization of goverment services is an absolute need, but i think it should start by startups capitalizing on the long proceadure and create a standard ""human API"" that will be adapted by the goverment afterwards. which is something i didn't see yet (will be extremely interested in working on one, ""an IT worker here"")

The surveillance part is very dystopian in my opinion, the UK and US have it like taht now because of gradual steps and is extremely scrutanized in each step. in our case it will become an instant dystopia if we do it that way, thankfully we have a lot fo money problems that it will take it's time.

Also when I was at the end of 18 years old I was 169 cm or even less (measured it at hospital with shoes), I became interested in height when I hit GYM before my 20th anniversary. 
The best things that help are deep sleep (when I was 18 bac student I was the best student so I was often sleeping between 4 and 6 hours and that's too few), good nutrition( milk, cheese, eggs and natural yogurt in breakfast, chicken, meat, fish, something with high protein in lunch, amonds, fruits, vegetables especially one carrot per day), sports and exercise ( try sprinting everyday in the morning, hanging at GYM)
Also I'm thinking about using supplements, there are cheap things in Tunisia and expensive things outside but I should take a decision and choose wisely to avoid getting scammed.
Good luck mate.

&nbsp; 

Xenophobia which is the dislike/hate and prejudice against people from other countries, was the ""normal"" behavior for every society in history, some led to extreme racism and some are more casual and stayed within the realm of ""we don't marry from these people"". 

&nbsp; 

Eventually, with globalization the world is slowly evolving into shifting from these old mentalities, but to do that, you need to keep up with the natural evolution of societies in general. 

&nbsp; 

In a country in which is still acceptable among many (or some) of its people to have the following shit happens : 

* Suggest/force a girl to marry her rapist.

* feel superior because your grand parents had sex in the north instead of the south, or in a sea-side city instead of internal city.
 * -> hence you are a Targarian master race that must offer the ""jabri"" or ""weld bled""  tag to everyone you meet.

* Every other religion is not only 100% wrong, but their ritual/beliefs are disgusting and/or has been modified

* primary and highschool teachers/professors are a cartel to drain money from the parents.
 * the parents are mad about losing money but don't give a shit about the disaster these behavior will implant in their children


* Zawalizm and top rojla mentality is a majority thought-process.
 * yet Cops who casually kill/abuse people for the fuck of it.
 * still شعب ميبون who never properly reacts. 
 * yet they believe li they are more ""guer7in"" than all of the western world combine, here is a [preview about a proper شعب  doing a real protest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLjToexLzPw) 


&nbsp; 

So yeah, as much as i love this country and wish the best for it, i deeply believe that nothing will change on its own, the age of a ""one leader"" who can influence a people into a one direction is over, and its impossible when you have even a half-functionning democracy, unless we go full China/North Korea, the only glimpse of hope is to re-educate the entire population, but how do we do that when the educators themselves are a piece of shit ? and how can you (and me) blame them when their salary don't last them half a month. 



&nbsp; 

Once we understand all this, seeing this sort of behavior should become expected. 


&nbsp;

PS:

Explaining, understanding and expecting **IS NOT JUSTIFYING**, and doesn't mean you (or me) shouldn't help to improve the situation and avoid these disgusting behavior. 

&nbsp;

PS 2:

Sfax is a *VERY* special case compared to the rest of the country, i would say the only other shithole is the capital, which make sense since it has the biggest population in the country, hence, the highest chance of cunts co-existing together.",2024-01-08 10:49:39

> One side wants to live as peaceful neighbors (Israel)

Lmao. That and other lies you can tell yourself, Israel is a far-right state which wishes to ensure a Jewish majority on what was not Jewish majority land. To do so, it has to commit ethnic-cleansing against the Palestinian people. To maintain it, it must keep said Palestinians out and uphold a race-based colonial system. The Palestinian authorities in the West Bank chose to make peace with Israel. In return, Israel increased its settlements in the West-Bank and ethnic cleansing of Jerusalem, and Palestinians there live humiliated under the mercy of the Israeli military occupation, seeing new settlements keep being built for some random crazy religious Brooklyn guys who come armed.

There will never be peace as long as the Palestinians do not receive justice for all they have endured since 1948. Personally, I could never heal if I were in their place",2024-01-08 06:06:40

I do indeed recognize meaning it personally at first, but its inherent generalization of this messed up plethora of cognitive bias that countless Tunisians do hold, while at the same time claiming otherwise is just sickening. You are not without knowing, notably during info wars (typically the current Middle Eastern unrest), our not so impartial and rigor-driven compatriots, for decades ongoing, keep cherry-picking information in an unequivocally one-sided fashion. You got some that ofc do realize the communitarian bias, but that do indulge under the dubious pretext of a ""greater cause"" or simply by religious-cultural brotherhood. One way of doing that I'm philosophically, absolutely opposed to, as I believe truth-approaching state of facts are a universal, incredibly nuanced and subtilized canvas. Infringing this paradigm often results in gatekeeping, calumny, and sweeping bad fandangos that one's side perpetuated under the rug. 

&#x200B;

Typically, an example would be proven Hamas' wrongdoings that are still to this day disregarded, contested and so on. Whereas, it suffices, for the average Tunisian Joe, to share any shady-sourced video upon sight, as long as it undermines the pointed enemy action and bolsters the general view of an xyz case. Again I'm using the Israelo-Arab conflict as the par excellence example, but it still holds true for some Anti-Westernism/Europism and the sacrosanct primal Anti-Americanism which all, at this point, just sculpted a whole societal discourse/narrative that do influence million of Tunisians in their consideration for the outside world. 

&#x200B;

And Seeing everyone reproach American sources for so-called biased view, was for me the apotheosis of bad faith, boldness and unselfawareness. My aggressiveness was far from elegant but I'm genuinely sickened to see that the crushing majority of my compatriots do not have a critical questioning, that do prevent self-centric potentially dangerous views. And you were the scapegoat. I believe you might have a bit of empathy and impartiality to at least recognize all of this perduring problems in the Tunisian society views, most of which, are more likely than not indefinitely perennial.",2024-01-08 04:22:06

If not check them out. I’m not sure what they are up to now, after Kais Said’s coupe but before that in the parliamentary system they were a small political party with the same liberal (free market) ideas you shared here. Im not sure what remained of them today, whether they supported and still support the path of Kais Said (can’t imagine it but who knows) and where their (former) leader Yassine Brahim is these days.

Btw in todays system - engineered by our glorious leader - you would at least be considered to be “suspicious” by جماعة التآمر على امن الدولة most likely for holding two nationalities and actively involving yourself in politics or even just civil society s.

Taxis can take unnecessary turns to make it longer so always use Google maps. In Hammamet, I don't think it should cost more than 20 dt. The price doubles at night after 9 tho. 

You can use an application for taxis : Yassir, Bolt, InDrive. I don't know if they work in Hammamet. But I don't think you would find a problem finding a taxi anyway.

Learn few words in Tunisian, we usually appreciate it.

When I graduated and got a full time job, I was instantly in that isolation.

My circle of friends really shrunk to a small group, who although still close friends, live in other cities. This makes the frequency of hanging out small. I have to wait at least two weeks so I can see a friend. And for that, we have to plan, where and when, unlike random hangouts at uni. I don't wanto make friends with my colleagues, I am getting on well with them but I don't want corporate friends to become friends.

I met someone a couple of months ago, I approached her and we met and talked for some time, and now we are dating.

Seeing the camaraderie and willingness to help on subreddits like r/fishing, where people from all corners of the globe come together to support even the most inexperienced anglers, really highlights the value of community spirit. They're not just ahead in fishing; this attitude reflects a broader culture of sharing and helping that can be beneficial in many aspects of life.

It's a bit disheartening to see reluctance in sharing knowledge in our community. The real treasure is not just the fishing spots but the collective wisdom and the joy of helping others.

kh3iqia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/192hu0k/hot_takes/kh3iqia/,5,"its very easy to call you edgy, based on how you presented yourself here, but some part of it sounds and reads like ""a call to brutal honesty and unmasked emotions and affections"" but you will soon find out that people keep up appearances for a reason, its otherwise very difficult to build and maintain a civilization, (yes you too are part of this civilization/culture, though hard to believe or see it, people can only flee so far to come back and still go to the super market wela l3attar and exchange smiles wela glares) and it is hard for a social animal to just metamorphose in public and become an unfiltered monkey without ruffling way too many feathers and still be able to maintain a safe spot where he is, thats why people do it behind closed doors and even there, gossip victims are countless (am a fan of gossip as an intelligent mass destructive (and renewing) weapon!!) 

Point is, its not enough to point out contradictions or behaviors that dont align with yours, especially statements concerning culture as a whole.

Understand the rules, only then you can break them at your own terms as you develop a good sense of who you are.

Another thing regarding the cold blooded-ness, what is there is there, what isnt, isnt, you dont choose who you are, what you are chooses you, and your appearance, to me, hate has always been a motivation to be more sophisticated in taste and people, hate towards self, meant that there is some worms and characteristics that will die out in time, did not and will not belong for long (it was a trust the process thing), and regarding poeple, who i hang out with, mattered so much, and it was purely based on how i felt about people and those who couldn't hang with me i simply let them go, if you are truly unafraid of getting cutt off, then reverse the selectiveness, you select, not they, and it becomes more and more an issue of grace and dignity then with ""what i want and why"", having style and elegance and manners matters so much in designing not authenticity itself (thats what you should operate from) but how authenticity was presented, it really is a design! 

Just my two cents on the matter here, cheers",2024-01-09 19:45:16

I have no hope in changing Kais supporters hive mind

* Once you show them he's lying about shortages, they'll tell you it's good that there's shortages to save money.
* Once you show them he's actually taking on even more debt, they'll tell you it's not in dollars and will improve the country and support the economy.
* Once you tell them he cut public investments while increasing his own budget by astronomical amounts, they'll tell you he needs more resources and there was inflation.
* Once you tell them why should people take the brunt of that inflation but certain prices stay constant and hurt the economy while the president can't take that damage from inflation, they'll tell you no he didn't do it himself.
* Once you show them he's the one that proposed it or signed it, they'll tell you you're nahdhaoui and evil and the western world fed you lies and it's Israel's fault and the whole world including Bhutan and Tuvalu are conspiring against the country... or they'll just insult your family, move on, and turn on wataneya and facebook for their daily dose of conspiracy",2024-01-09 17:29:54

I wish that was the only thing. What's sad is that all of this is being done and resulting in an even worse situation. Debt as a whole has gone up but it's more internal debt that will lead to inflation.

At the same time, by doing this to keep prices artificially constant and harassing producers, local production will keep going down just like it did for potatoes and milk unrelated to weather challenges. So every year it will keep getting worse because they will need to import even more but they will have less money so they'll import even less. Shortages will get worse and worse.

This president had a golden chance to do reforms. People are accepting the pain of shortages and whatnot to hope for a better future. Instead, he caused pain and on top of that doubled down on the broken system, created more debt while also killing local production and civil liberties and even people's trust in each other. All of that to not sacrifice his populism and risk losing some votes.

It's a true disaster but people keep marching on into the abyss and chasing down the mysterious people killing the economy when in fact it is them and Kais Saied the entire time.",2024-01-09 17:23:29

kh1w5a2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/191255d/your_view_about_tunisians_born_abroad/kh1w5a2/,1,"> Par conséquent il y a parfois un décalage entre les Tunisiens de l'étranger et les Tunisiens Tunisiens, c'est vrai. 

Je ne te parles pas ici d'un simple conservatisme type prière et pas trop de fête, mais de personnes qui sont carrément alignés sur les mouvements islamistes ou et salafistes. Alors que la Tunisie a été victime de deux attentats qui ont plongé le principal revenu du pays (tourisme) dans la crise, on voit souvent des crétins qui reviennent en Tunisie pour nous faire la morale sur comment la tunisie n'est pas assez islamique et prôner des ""traditions"" qui ne sont même pas celle de nos parents, des fois en ne parlant même la langue du pays. Il faut appeler un chat un chat, beaucoup de zmigris sont influencés voir carrément adeptes des idéologies islamistes, ce qui ne passe pas du tout en Tunisie pour une majorité de tunisiens, conservateurs ou non. Pour appuyer mon propos, lors des élections présidentielles de 2019, le candidat salafiste Sofiane Makhlouf a reçu 50% de ces votes depuis l'étranger . De plus ceux-ci ont le culot de venir clamer que certains tunisiens sont ""occidentalisés""( alors qu'ils sont NES ET VIVENT EN OCCIDENT) car n'ayant la vision que eux ont d'un etat Musulman. Regardes les commentaires en français sur certains posts en ligne sur la Tunisie pour comprendre la débilité de ces gens, type "" C du kufr"" ""C de la fitnah ( ? ) ""nous c'est pas comme ça dans le Sud"" alors que de 1. La majorité de la population tunisienne vit sur la côte 2. Les gens du sud aussi, bien que plus conservateurs, ont tendance à s'alcooliser( cf récent empoisonnement à Mednine à cause d'alcool frelaté), à être plus ouvert d'esprit que la majorité des musulmans dans le monde et sont LOIN LOIN LOIN de la vision romancée qu'on les zmigris  


Bon il y a aussi le profils de l'inverse, ceux qui vont refuser tout contacts avec les natifs car étant barbares, blédards, et étant racistes envers les natifs, voyant le négatif partout dans leur démarche et étant très condescants sur leur manière d'être par exemple "" Ah bon tu utilises de l'eau pour te nettoyer"" ou "" Ah les femmes ont pas de libertés chez les arabes( c'est faux, ici en Tunisie du moins)"". Mais bon ces profils sont moins courant car ils ne rentrent pas en Tunisie pour les vacances   


>  qu'à titre personnel si je vivais en Tunisie, dans un village, et que je voyais des gens chaque été se ramener avec des vêtements et des appareils tape à l'œil et bien j'aurais été un ""profiteur"" peut-être. 

Bon l'image du village elle est trompeuse. La majorité des gens habitent aujourd'hui en ville ou dans les périphéries de celles-ci, et même si les conditions sont atroces, on est pas sur de la misère. Il y a beaucoup de gens qui font simplement de l'extorsion sur leur famille à l'étranger sous la menace de couper les liens familiaux et de salir le nom de la dite famille au pays. Il faut être honnête ça existe et c'est de la merde. Ils ont largement de quoi vivre mais font ça dans l'espoir de flamber avec des objets issu de l'étranger .  


Après il y en a qui immigre illégalement et s'attende à ce que leur famille leur donne refuge. C'est risqué parce que s'ils se font attraper c'est une amende de 25.000 euros pour la famille qui héberge.   


Bon on peut quand-même apporter de la nuance. Il y a aussi des gens qui vivent en france, qui promettent à tout va ""ouais une fois que t'es en france tkt je t'arrange le tout juste viens"" et qui les lâchent au bout de trois jours.",2024-01-09 14:08:47

It's hoonestly a scummy move to anyone with a stable business which means that all the money you paid to the goverment is not going to get back to you ever and you will keep feeding the beast for the next 5 to 8 years for no direct improvement to you. in my opinion we will see more tax evasion than before (as per the streisand effect). it will probably cause some big division between people too.

I work for a development company that helps tunisian businesses acquire machinery or technical assistance, I see on a daily basis the economic potential and the impressive skills available to the country, and yet change is slow. there's a minority that is doing what it can, and in that minority an even smaller actually brilliant minority that faces government bureaucracy, self-interested leadership and a stupid majority that doesn't understand the cost of progress or even want it. A movement would be nice, but we also lack leadership the people would actaully follow. I  will have great admiration for anyone willing to sacrifice for Tunisia.

Item #: SCP-KKKK  
  
Object Class: Euclid  
  
Special Containment Procedures:  
SCP-KKKK is to be contained within Site-XX, designated as the ""Presidential Suite."" Security personnel are to monitor SCP-KKKK's interactions with other entities, and any deviations from standard political behavior are to be reported immediately.  
  
SCP-KKKK is to be provided with a standard assortment of diplomatic amenities, including but not limited to: global news updates, diplomatic briefings, and an extensive library of political philosophy literature.  
  
Access to SCP-KKKK's containment area is restricted to authorized personnel only. Attempts to directly influence SCP-KKKK's decision-making process should be avoided unless approved by Level 4 personnel.  
  
Description:  
SCP-KKKK, designated ""President K,"" is a humanoid entity currently occupying the position of President in the nation-state designated ""Tunisia."" SCP-KKKK exhibits anomalous behavior, displaying tendencies that deviate from traditional political norms.  
  
SCP-KKKK has demonstrated a heightened affinity for utilizing constitutional mechanisms to consolidate power, resulting in the alteration of established political structures. The entity often engages in unorthodox methods of communication, including but not limited to televised speeches, decrees, and unconventional use of executive powers.  
  
Notably, SCP-KKKK has shown an exceptional resistance to containment by conventional political forces, leading to increased difficulty in predicting its future actions. Attempts to decipher SCP-KKKK's decision-making process have yielded inconclusive results.  
  
SCP-KKKK's anomalous properties may extend to its ability to influence and captivate the general public, leading to widespread support despite deviations from standard governance practices. The memetic influence of SCP-KKKK has proven challenging to neutralize, with citizens exhibiting an inclination to interpret its actions through various ideological lenses.  
  
Addendum KKKK-01: Ongoing research is required to understand the long-term effects of SCP-KKKK's anomalous governance on the geopolitical landscape. Researchers are advised to approach this task with a blend of caution and a sense of humor, as the entity's behavior continues to perplex both political analysts and containment specialists.",2024-01-09 11:04:07

kh16az0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/191ioly/political_economic_situation/kh16az0/,1,"You need some context to understand how deep is the problem:

Since centuries, even before the arrival of the french occupation, Big families, close to the king at the time, reigned over the countries economy, shared its markets. Also something like the local guilds\* dominated the markets and had a huge influence over the economy's progress and development. Those two factors caused huge setbacks of the development of Tunisian economy and technological progress.

Fast forward to 1956, after the independence, those same families were still the reigning families on the Tunisian economy, and the same corruption was still in place, it is just the head of state that changed, and they only had to adapt to that.

Starting from that point, a lot of things went good or wrong, Bourguiba had the good insight to invest in Tunisian infrastructure, with the low resources he had, I guess he tried his best. But he failed in the most important domains. To summarize, he failed to build a strong economy, to overcome the domination of the aforementioned families and corruption, and in his fear of his political opponents, (we have to admit that most of them did not have great ideas on how to govern the country) he did not invest a lot in the militarisation of the country (this is actually not bad, that made Tunisia one of the rare countries of the region not to be under military rule and domination) but he did invest a lot in homeland security, which made the police very strong, and especially by the end of his rule, which transformed the country into a police state. The economy was not doing great, it had its ups and downs, but was not performing at its full potential, and impacts of that will show later.

Starting from 1987, with Ben Ali, the former interior minister, as they say in french, the first policeman, he came with his police mindset, and things went downhill rapidly. At first he showed some signs of democratic rule but things quickly changed when the Islamist party (Ennahdha) proved they can gather popular support and be a real player on the scene, and at the time, Ennahdha partisans were more hard core islamist than they are now, so Ben Ali ended the ""playtime"", rigged the elections, imprisoned or pushed to exile most of the opposition and established his rule.

Economically, things looked stable, some kind of prosperity was happening, but it was all in the hands of either the same families, foreign investors, or the new ruling family: The Ben Ali family. Ben Ali married his daughters from his first marriage to rich men, who became even richer and acquired more dominance.

After marrying Leila Trabelsi, she brought her family into the game, but they acted more like Mafia, and starting getting involved in every economic sector, forcibly grabbing businesses or acquiring shares in prospering businesses. Soon, The Trabelsi Family were a name to fear.

Then came 2011, and Ben Ali and Leila Trabelsi, fled the country, and left behind their families, most of them were imprisoned, and most of their possessions were taken away, also the possessions of their allied families were frozen, until the government sorted out what was acquired via corruption... However, things did not go as expected, and again, the ""system"" was not taken down, those same families just allied with the next player, and continued their business as usual, with a new small but important difference, they are now the ones controlling the politicians and they don't fear the ruler anymore. So their dominance over economy and economy grew a lot. 2011 uncovered how bad things were economically, it turned out the Tunisian economy was very fragile, mix that with mismanagement during the 2011-2019 period, and political quarrels between the Islamist and their opponents, and rise of terrorism. Then came covid, it hit the country hard, and he economy is still recovering, add to that the Ukrainian war, and the global economic crisis, Tunisian economy is brought down to its knees.

All that to say that Tunisian economy has always struggled under the rule of greedy families who ruled over a corrupt empire, add a lot of mismanagement and bad decisions, that gives you a crippled economy, and very bad environment for investment. There are a lot of laws that were put in place and that are supposed to make Tunisia a better place to do business, but in practice, it is very difficult to start a serious business that can compete with existing established businesses.

Politically, Tunisia is in a very bad place, because of the economic crisis. The president and his government are failing to resolve the most essential problems, food shortages (it is not famine, but a lot of first necessity products are being rationed), and instead of taking actions and start reforming the economy, the president is spending a lot of money on a political project that no one is interested in, and is blaming the opposition for his failures to save the economy, is chasing down every voice that exposes this failure, and every one who criticizes his policies. The parliament is a literal joke, the government is not able to act without the president's orders and consent... Basically we have a bad king ruling over a struggling country during a global crisis. Just picture that",2024-01-09 10:01:40

The reality is that less than 1% of transactions (way less) involves foreigners (unless you consider Tunisians working abroad as foreigners).
Consider that foreigners won’t buy:
* In a country where there are no advantages when they can buy in Portugal (example) with several tax advantages, top infrastructure, security and stability, low cost of living.
* In a country where everything is made difficult for them to make a transaction as simple as purchasing a house (difficult, long and corrupt process of getting governors approval, difficult, long and corrupt process of getting their funds out of the country if they want to rent or sell)
* In middle class neighborhoods where there is a serious lack of minimal services like clean sidewalks, any sense of common civilization;
* They simply can’t in rural areas bc they have no legal right to acquire there

kh12h19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/190pfvk/the_economic_bubble_of_the_tunisian_housing_market/kh12h19/,1,"To answer your two questions in short:
* The tunisian banks are extremely cautious when according mortgages in Tunisia, there is a very thin risk of economic impact due to a housing market bubble.
* Government plans (I am not aware of any) to build homes wouldn’t devaluate the current housing inventory because (if this happens and it wont bc again the gov doesn’t plan to build anything) because it would be built in remote places with no public transportation, an no facilities (good schools, hospitals, work opportunities…) it wont be able to challenge the existing neighborhoods. So what will happen is that existing houses keeps their value, and new ones will be sold cheap for those who doesn’t care (or do not have the choice).

Now for the market in general, as many things in Tunisia, the issue isn’t the prices but the median Tunisian income. A house have a cost to be built, raw materials increased dramatically in the past years, the land value increased a lot in decent neighborhoods due to shortage of offers, interest rates are double what they where 10 years ago, all this makes the prices legit. But again, all comes back to salaries and the Dinar valuation, the country isn’t producing enough.
We need to work more, produce more, and push government to enabling more economic freedom laws/actions. There is no other solution.

PS: the housing market is a pain in the US too, Gen Z & millennials are no longer able to access to the housing industry.",2024-01-09 09:12:16

For instance, I've passed by coffee shops in Jordan ( Amman ) and the smell of Turkish coffee was so good that I'd stop for a cup plus something sweet to go with it.  

Service shouldn't be too friendly or chatty; I prefer staff to be rather professional and mind their own business.

Atmosphere should be relaxed, soft lighting, quiet with maybe a little jazz music in the background or similar ( elevator music is fine too ). 

The place should be squeaky clean. 

They should've a decent selection of cakes and sandwiches.  Just cover the basics  - tuna, cheese or chicken sandwich - chocolate cake, apple pie and traditional Arabic sweets.  Focus on quality rather the variety.

First would be quick: get coffee, get in get out.
Second would be if I’m hanging out for a while with others
Last would be if I’m planing on working or studying for a bit

I am going to prioritize location, convenience and speed, pay by card etc if it is a quick trip. I won’t care about aesthetics/decoration.
But not as important if I am hanging out. 

If I’m hanging out, then chill servers are appreciated. Ambiance is a factor but I would take better quality coffee over ambiance.

If I’m working/studying: outlets are great. WiFi. Smaller table options. 


For me I typically look for:
-Coffee quality (I’ll pay more for better coffee)
-healthy snacks/food options. Why dont places sell straight fruit? 
-pay by card. Biggest reason is the constant dance to have coins can be hard 
-non smoking area can be great, especially if children are around

For context consideration, I’m a foreigner. I recognize I may have some differing cultural values when it comes to coffee shops.
I am also upper middle class here so that is another factor to consider in my case.

That’s not to say no mistakes have been made on the Israeli side. And like I said, I don’t support the WB settlements.

But no it didn’t lead to any real improvements in the daily lives of Tunisian citizens, it was actually politically speaking a big chaos which reflected very poorly society as a whole and since 2011 it’s been going economically overall from bad to worse. 

Since the coupe detat it’s at BEST a democracy like Turkey is. At BEST. If u ask me it’s not even that. It’s closer to Morocco which is not a democracy. Where the big boss bends the rules in his favor, without resorting YET to falling back into 100% dictatorship. But there is nothing that can prevent Kais Said or one of his close associates in the future from becoming an absolute dictator now. No checks and balances anymore to prevent that. Nor are Tunisians on overall really concerned with that; majority doesn’t give a fuck anymore at this point and after all what happened from 2011 onwards. Which means democracy is already dead yes. 

We’re both part of the (miserable) Arab world buddy….this is our status quo. Won’t change anytime soon.

Just for fun, I decided to look at the list and write down which countries have only been founded in their current form since 1900. 

Egypt- 1971 (Preceded by United Arab Republic) 

Greece- Hellenic Republic- 1974 (preceded by Kingdom of Greece and Greek Junta)

Italy- Italian Republic- 1946- Preceded by Kingdom of Italy 

China- PRC- 1949- Preceded by last Imperial Dynasty and Republic of China

France- Fifth Republic- 1958- Founded by Charles De Gaulle after collapse of Fourth Republic.

Spain- Kingdom of Spain- 1978- Founded after death of Franco and the end of the dictatorship.

India- Republic of India- 1950- Founded after collapse of the British Raj.

And on and on and on. 

And *Tunisia.*

Republic of Tunisia- 1957 (but the Second Republic since only 2014)- Founded after independence from the French. The current flag has only been official since 1999.

Again, if we're talking pure evidence based science then historians like Wasnbrough (1977) have concluded that the Quran was assembled in Iraq a few decades after the death of the prophet and the source material of which the Quran was compiled would have been a more diverse grouping of (inter) related texts which would have been compiled during the prophets's lifetime or shortly after his death, primarily by Abu Bakr who ordered Zayd ibn Thabit to compile a single manuscript which was later standardized under Uthman.

These emergent properties are not explicitly present in the individual components but become apparent at a higher level of organization. The whole system exhibits characteristics that cannot be fully explained or predicted by examining its individual parts alone.

An example is the way individual neurons in the brain interact to give rise to consciousness. Consciousness is an emergent property that emerges from the intricate connections and interactions among neurons, even though no single neuron possesses consciousness.

In physics, another example is the behavior of water molecules. The properties of wetness, fluidity, and surface tension emerge from the interactions of countless water molecules, yet these properties are not inherent in individual H2O molecules.

Emergent phenomenas are basically properties that we cannot predict by only analysing its components. We cannot predict the structure of snowflakes by knowing the properties of water molecules, for instance.",2024-01-11 00:30:49

Also, ask yourself, your personal values that don't align with islam where did they come from? Western culture? some of these things may come from being over exposed to the western world, from living in a personal limited bubble (Par example you probably never lived through a war donc makch mestensa b concept l slavery. Maybe this won't please certain people ama ma tansesh it's war. Fama hajet kbar isirou in war such as killing other human beings. Juste la3alla enti mestensa tasma3 b killing w matasma3sh b taking people as slaves.) My advice to you is learn about islam from qualified and trusted sources, Pray to allah sincerely to guide you, W remember eli Manaarfouch kol chay w manefhmouch kol chay. We are weak humans.

Islam is the truth, it didn't come from a human being. why would another human tell you whats right w whats wrong? alech moch enti mela tqolou? hak enti zeda human. Islam came from the creator, Allah. Who knows far far more than what we do. When you are Muslim, you submit to Allah. Dont get me wrong, it's not blind faith. Ama i advise you to stay away from the sources eli ichawchou aalik afkarek (so many westerners are hypocrites, they apply their rules only to what pleases them. yahkiw aal freedom w liberalism ama Look at Gaza now. See, that's why we need the truth from the creator and not from humans. Alot of humans did so much fased)  w i advise you to learn more about religion from qualified scholars of knowledge.

\-determined : yeah that's one of major traits of success, no one want a lazy person with no goal in his life,  not determined person is one step closer to be a big baby   
\-being professional : shows how much control the person has over his thoughts, which shows ability to think rationally, knows limits,reliable, positive attitude etc etc  that's more than attractive and a potential good partner   
\-family responsability :  that's attractive,  because a girl will be his next family, which shows if he will be responsible enough   for her and the kids or not  
\-commited to hobby / gym :  that shows if he has the ability to have commitment lol , if he does not  commit to himself, to his body or his hobby \[activity he loves\] , how will he be able to commit to another person, or to the well being of a family lol   
\-work and studies : reflect generally career and success ,  ofc it's not always the case , but it's most cases  
\-being quit often , meeh that's not attractive for most people but for those who find it attractive because they know, it's a sign for high intelligence and self control

all of those are not physical traits like you said , rather characteristics or personality traits or whatever

good looking guy  \[ which mean , tall, symmetrical face, clear skin , sharp eye nice hair etc etc \] which mean good genetics  as potential good kids   etc etc

Specifically what parts do inspire and help you? As a believer, you seem to have lost the ""awe"" which would inspire fear and guilt and love, and tie down your spirit to its meaning and purpose, spiritually this would be more powerful and harder to put into words, because its an individually intimate experience, to me, religious people (most of em) are no different than atheists, much much less different than they think they are, because they both have no sense of that experience that makes them sensitive to anything beyond themselves, rarely do you sense a soulful person, one who is actually animated, bursts with vitality and life, that is wholly motivated by his own being and his own beliefs and his own spirit, nvm where he gets it from, god or his own ass, he is fearless, and you dont become that way by either knocking shyly at the door of your nihilism, or entering and wallowing there scratching at the walls like a pitiful bug, my point is! Start seeking and Face your fears, if you truly feel like a hypocrite nvm the outcomes, ask and answer your questions and follow the threads to the very end, be discerning and mindful of your own well being, and pay heed to the green areas where you feel you can work with/in (that would be looking out for the principles and values you do treasure about islam or outside of islam or wherever,) but have courage and take this seriously if you seriously mean it that you want to attempt to further understand your world and spirit, there isnt really much else to do, sweeping things under the rug would be giving up!!

* Local Tunisians who think Tunisian French are too much, lecturing everybody how they're too westernized. 
* Local Tunisians, like you, who think Tunisian French hate how much locals are not liberal enough. 

I guess that depends on the individual and their own history (we always are the ""liberal"" and the ""conservative"" of someone, I guess).

Otherwise, thank you for your wonderfull post !! That's great to read someone who value their culture, traditions, and don't think key is to copy others ! I read so much Tunsians who seem ashamed of what they are, until those who live in Tunisia and go to french school, not even talking arabic, that's a waste !! (for what I read only, I don't wanna generalize and I know Reddit may not be representative of all Tunisian people).  

I know I don't live here, I know I didn't really have to be impacted by reality of everyday's life in Tunisia. But, somehow, my parents gave me the love they had for the country they left.

Correct your numbers ya sahyuni, it was not 1200 civilians, a large number of them were soldiers and police officers, and a large number of israeli ""civilians"" was killed by the idf itself. no hamas didn't think the zionist entity would do nothing, they expected them to do a land invasion which they prepared for.

>If they did, and this is most likely,  then they are no more than a tool and TERRORISTS in the hands of Iran,  which does not care about the Palestinians (and this is probably because  of the Saudi-Israeli normalization deal, which doesn't please Iran).

Oui, c'est vrai que par simplicité c'est tellement cool d'avoir des gens qui parlent ta langue, moi le premier ça a fait que je n'ai pas toujours fait l'effort de parler. D'autant quand tu rentres en vacances, entre les cousins de France comme toi et les locaux bien francophones, t'as pas trop besoin. 

Mais y a aussi l'autre côté, sans même parler de moqueries, parfois tu essayes de parler Tunisien mais l'autre en face ne joue pas le jeu et te parle en Français (parce qu'on va pas se mentir aussi, beaucoup de Tunisiens hebou y warri rouehom 😂).

Tunisia was ruled by the Ottomans from 1574 until 1881. Before which it was briefly ruled by *drumroll* the Spanish Empire.



Islam adopted the 6 pointed star. It was first mentioned by Josephus as a Jewish symbol in the first century. Islam was founded in the 8th century. So no, you have no idea what you’re talking about.

So… the Ottomans upheld a medieval state that ran on slavery and was the successor to a state that had its capital in Damascus? Cool cool.

On the other hand, contraband people are mostly ""good"" people, the majority of the people in Tunisia consume smuggled artifacts. If it was not the contraband, many kids and families wouldn't enjoyed el3id essghir since the legalized artifacts are much more expensive; neither could've they managed to get school utilities.

In short, I'm not pro-contrband, but the few guys I met who work or worked in contraband have work ethics khir menn employee ydaldel fehom w yokhles b tax money.

kh90wiz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/190o1ou/so_they_included_usa_saudi_arabia_and_morocco_but/kh90wiz/,1,"> Considering Israel as a name has been continually used to refer to the region by Jews, and others, alongside Syria-Palestina since the Roman Period, the primary language is a descendent dialect of the original regional language and that spoken by Samaritans, and the flag has a symbol that has also been continually used to convey the region, as expressed in literal archaeology and architecture even on Palestinian buildings within the West Bank, your argument is asinine and inaccurate.

Having a name that could be traced back to antiquity doesn’t make a state “older”. Mauritania as a country dates back to the 20th century yet it gets its name from an ancient North African kingdom in northern Morocco and western Algeria. Both of them have nothing to do with each others. Besides, the region was also known as Canaan or Palestine from at least the 5th century BC.
The flag of Israel dates back to the end of the 19th century and was adopted in 1948. The star of David itself comes from the seal of Solomon which as a symbol was used by both Muslims and Jews. It started to be used as a symbol of the Jewish people much later on. 

> The current state of Egypt has been entirely other states since before the 1970s and was British and Ottoman in the 19th century. It does not have the same administrative language, governmental system, or capital as 150 years ago, and does not have the same language, religion, capital. or system as before the 700s.
Tunisia was French for a long period between the 16th C. and today and has had a bunch of flags.
Unless you consider the capital of Tunisia to be Paris or Tunisian people to be Ottoman Barbary
Pirates?

Muhammad Ali Pasha is regarded as being the founder of modern day Egypt. Cairo has been the capital of successive states since the 10th century. After their conquest of Egypt, the Ottomans kept the same governmental system that dates back to the Mamluk era. 

Tunisia fell to the french in the end of the 19th century, before then, it was a full nation state with its own dynasty, laws , modern army and flag with the monarch (the Bey of Tunis) swearing allegiance to the Sultan. Tunis has been the capital since the 13th century. 

Both of these cases are completely different form Israel. Israel literally was never the successor of any preexisting state.",2024-01-10 19:28:15

I can tell you this is far from happening everywhere in Tunisian families, I am a man, a brother and a father of a girl, I will never behave like this toward any women surrounding me. It all comes on the values you were raised around, and the environment you grow up in. This to tell you that you should not accept any kind of violence/abuse nor consider this acceptable.

Now this doesn’t mean you should turn your back to your family. And I will go against lying, this is unacceptable too. You should tell them something like « count on me to give you as much as I can and beyond, but my salary is my business, nothing is guaranteed, I am on probation period, but again count on me to give you the maximum I can, please respect that. »

Also I understand you went thru difficult times during your earlier years, financially wise, you might be tempted to spend more, that’s fully your right, just do it wisely, don’t be provocative with your personal spendings otherwise they will ask you to give more.
Once you move to your own house, you may have the lifestyle you want.

Finally, I’d say CONGRATULATIONS 🎉🥳 on your new job, do not let anything/anyone prevent you from enjoying your moment. This is the first step in accomplishing what you have been working on for years during your studies.",2024-01-10 19:06:28

I am not saying you shouldn’t dream. You should absolutely dream, especially when you’re young. 
It’s just that a dream is not a strategy.

And if I had a nickel for every some young person comes here and starts wanting to fix Tunisia by fixing its administration, I would be able to pay off the debt out of my pocket.
The key is in the economy. Once the economy flourishes again, you will be able to afford any changes to the public sector.
Once Tunisia becomes a cash cow, you can create all the autonomy you want on a regional or local level.

In the meantime, stop thinking about more tax and more admin and let the people do some business and have the safety to invest.",2024-01-10 18:23:39

if it was a male society as you said logically men would be the providers and they wouldn't ask a woman for her money, also your brother seems like a loser, giving money to your parents seems understandable but your brother have no rights


Now here is what I would do in your situation, you should tell them you get the minimum salary, you shouldn't tell them the truth, depending on where you live, maybe you could say 400dt or 600dt  (it should be something believable)


Not sure why your brother want to know the salary but for your parent soonner or later you will have to help them, it sucks but with the current economy and unfortunately you can't pick your own family, you should consider helping them if they need it, you could consider it as paying them off for what they did to you growing up, you can start small by giving them 100dt or something maybe and especially if you are living with them, consider it rent, food.. 


To avoid your family and your brother in general you should consider moving out, go abroad or leave in a different city...


This was something that bothered me when I started working, my parent didn’t ask me directly for money but they showed some hints as if I am an investment for them where I would be paying them back the rest of my life, at first it bothered me, I didn't help at all in the beginning as I was still trying to figure out my life, I saw a lot of my friends sending money to their parents which made me feel bad, but after getting more and more stable I started sending small amounts which increased with time...

I realized life is getting more and more expensive, my parents weren't smart enough to have a good retirement plan and family is family, you can't replace your own family, as long as what you are sending wouldn't affect your life that should be ok, it may delay saving more money or buy stuff but that's the least you can do, better me not buying that usless thing over having the idea that my parents didn't have enough money to eat...",2024-01-10 17:55:38

My wife was born in Tunis, but she lived in Bizerte since she was 5 years old. 

when she wanted to make a passport for the first time, a birth certificate in French was required. 

In order to get that birth certificate: 

* **she has to go to the Paladeya of the capital in which her parents registered her in 1995, and ask for a first-time birth-certificate in french**

* Once they give it to her once in Tunis

* She can get from anywhere else in the country

So for her case, the effort needed to make a passport, had an extra bonus step of going from Bizerte to Tunis.

Life has dealt her shit cards, she needs to play with what she has. 

Besides, a job is temporary? Human life is temporary, her family could die tomorrow. She shouldn’t depend on anyone for anything, including her family. 

Obviously, that said, I advised her to stay until she saved up enough to move out, emergency funds are important. 

I understand women have it worse than men when living on their own as some people don’t want to rent to single women in fear of prostitution and that “immoral things” and she may become prey if the neighbourhood is bad, all sorts of criminals will want in. 

But tbf, a lot of women manage anyways, it’s not impossible and will probably be a better living situation for her, she can rent with a roommate if she’s scared.

You can give a number lower than what they'll pay you (even though that won't help because if s.o wants to know the salary based on your job category and the company name , they can find an approximate info). No one has the right to your money without your consent (it works for your fam, and your significant other ...) 
I suggest you buy your parents a gift each, out of love nothing else but never give money, based on what you said that your father doesn't need money. 
Suggestion 2: rent a place on your own if you can and stay away from the family drama, you're beginning a new chapter and you'll have other professional offers and you don't need that to affect your future choices

You will see how expensive the overhead of federation is. I still believe it makes sense for Germany or Spain. Tunisia is just too small and too poor to afford it.

And yes, of course you will have more politicians and more government clerks because you automatically create functions and work on the regional level that you had on a central level before.

This is not limited to governments. It’s a phenomenon every large company needs to deal with when it tries to give more autonomy to its regions/countries etc.

The second issue in your reasoning of „let me use my own tax money“ is the structural disparity of Tunisia‘s regions today. What you tax are the economic activities of people and businesses. 

I am sorry, I couldn’t quickly google more current or accurate data:
https://www.statista.com/statistics/1247008/distribution-of-gdp-in-tunisia-by-region/

The current state of Egypt has been entirely other states since before the 1970s and was British and Ottoman in the 19th century. It does not have the same administrative language, governmental system, or capital as 150 years ago, and does not have the same language, religion, capital. or system as before the 700s. 

Tunisia was French for a long period between the 16th C. and today and has had a bunch of flags. Unless you consider the capital of Tunisia to be Paris or Tunisian people to be Ottoman Barbary Pirates? 

Again, I am not saying that those countries are illegitimate. I am saying that the whole argument is ludicrous.

Like Egypt and Tunisia, Israel/Syria-Palestinia/ Palestine were part of foreign empires for extremely long periods of time. The last independent states there *were* Assyria and the Kingdoms of Judea and Samaria. Syria-Palestina was a Roman administered region whose capital was in modern day Syria and named so immediately following the third Jewish-Roman War.

Correction:

It wasn’t even called Syria-Palestina by the Ottomans, just Syria.

Then, make it with your dad, make him understand that because of the past events, you can't trust him with your money, even though he is your father, and it is not gonna change anything if knows how much you are paid, the money is going to your bank account anyways and he can't access it without your consent, so he has no choice but to accept your deal. And as for your brother, talk to your father about it and ask for protection or you will have to go the police.

And please, at any physical violence, don't just let it go, go to the police and let yourself pressured into dropping it. Women die every day because of that. Family cohesion is valued, but your health and value have much more value.",2024-01-10 15:53:31

I don't know how old you are but sometimes when you are in a living hell you can leave and start your life somewhere else

Lie, deceive, hide, have a double personality and a plan for your future.

You can shut them up by contributing sometimes , pay a bill or 2, buy groceries sometimes, buy your brother shoes or any gift, decieve them by making them think you work for their comfort.

If you can, try a find a place closer to your workplace and rent it, or get a husband as soon as possible (no pressure), basically, get away from your family.

This is quite a story: He always supported some candidate after 2011, in exchange for immunity (he had his share of financial crimes) but he always wanted to be more powerful. Before 2011 he was associated with powerful men and supported Ben Ali to the last minute, but he was kind of no one, just another entertainer, after 2011, he aimed for the top place. So he was involved in a lot of political affairs, and tried his best through his TV channel to influence the political scene. Not gonna get into details. I don't remember when exactly, he lost his son in some accident, so he launched a charity that helps a lot of people, he would bring some families in need, homeless or living in very bad conditions or sick... and ask for donations... then he started distributing food around the country (especially pasta)... people started ""chanting"" his name and asking him to become the next president... of course, that all was an act, and it worked, he announced he was a candidate for 2019's elections... the government at that time tried to stop him through a law that got approved in the parliament but the president BCE stopped it (it was non democratic, unconstitutional, but those were not the reason why the president stopped it) BCE died soon after, and the elections were held and NK passed to the second tour, but lost to Kais Saied. That was the story of how we nearly had Nabil Karoui as a president by buying votes, but he created a party (actually literally bought one, it was a small unknown party that ""suddenly"" changed its name, and elected NK as its president. A ""mystery"") and entered the run of the legislative elections, and his party won the second position in number of seats. That announced the start of the political crisis in Tunisia. Nabil Karoui's party allied with Ennahdha (first party) and tried to form a gov, but it did not work, Ennahdha were not serious about it and a lot of other details you can find on the internet... one thing led to another, and we had the coup of Kais Saied after July 25th 2021 events. Since then, the situation has not got any better politically. Sorry for this long text, but your question about vote buying opened a lot of wounds for me.

To get better we need to start by getting rid of the current president, and all those who are around him and supporting him. He is like a schizophrenic hearing voices in his head and acting on them, and everyone around him is validating his behavior. No one dares to convince him of his situation and those who dare to raise a concern are lynched on the public place. I know I may be delusional, but the political rivals (of the 2011 - 2021 period) who are the current opposition of KS, need to sit together seriously, admit their failures, and agree on allying their forces toward a lot reforms, especially political and economical... I am optimistic about this because I know it can happen, because it happened before in other countries (like in South Africa). It doesn't need to be perfect, I don't ask for people to be punished or imprisoned even though some of them are actual criminals, I think that a national reconciliation is possible, where every side admits its errors, and commits to never backslide.

We, as opposition (Yes I am politically active), hoped that international pressure would push Kais Saied to back down, but it doesn't seem that the West is interested a lot in those matters, and that makes things even harder. Political action for now is risky and merely efficient, we are just surviving. Tunisians are no longer interested in politics, not even enough to express their disapproval, even though individually a lot of Tunisians are suffering or are fed up with the situation, but they are aiming the anger at each other. Also the president's propaganda seems to be working, when he puts the blame on the opposition or some criminals who act in the shadows, for every problem. The economic actors are just waiting for the storm to pass, but meanwhile the socio-economic situation in the country is not getting any better. My fear is that some day we reach the point of ne return, and the people rise against the state and against each other.

Israel was just the southern region of Canaan than came Romans and took it just like Israelites took it from Canaanites and that land specifically has been fought over by literally everyone, yet it belongs to Canaanites historically which are now modern-day Palestinians, Lebanese, Jordans and many more.   


Carthage was also a Canaanite Empire, but they separated themselves from the levant and specifically Tyre and lived in Carthage for thousands of years and they mixed with the local Amazigh population and lived in peace together for so long that you can't distinguish them from each other when talking about Carthage. That long time created an independent ethnic group and an independent nationality you could say of Carthage in the region of what is now Tunisia so.  


One more fun fact, actual Israelites are modern-day Palestinians as well because Israelites themselves were a Canaanite cult that worship Yahweh and thought they are special for doing so hint why they stole the part of the land for themselves twice and got it taken from them each time. The Zionists that are in Israel right now are Caucasians Europeans and from everywhere but the Levant itself.

If the latter, you should definetly watch Al7a9i9a wassarab (I know it's a masri show but it's such a masterpiece of early 2000's directing it is Emmy tier).

There's another wonderful production by alwatania from (2016?2015) called warda wa kiteb. What a trailblazer that was! So thought provoking (I especially enjoyed contemplating on which illegal substance the profits from that show helped launder so cool!).

That he wanted you to find those messages?? He had to have known, that you would access the emails in order to get the password and therefore would be privy to his personal messages. Perhaps he's too chickenshit to tell your mother himself, so this way, he figured you'd be the one that would go running to her to break the news.
If you're super close to your mom, perhaps, this is what he was counting on. Idk, I'm just speculating.
But regardless of whatever motives your dad may have had, you're still a kid. It is neither your place nor responsibility to talk about your father's infidelities with your mom.
I can't even begin to imagine how scary and nerve-wracking it would be to confront your father about the current situation. But perhaps, you could print out one of the more incrimidating emails (but certainly, not one with any kind of sexual content), and ask him if he would care to explain the situation to you. This way, you more or less force his hand into addressing the situation with your mom.
Only you know what kind of man your dad is and whether he avoids conflict at any cost. And only you know, what will send your mom over the edge.
So short of playing it stupid or confronting your dad with the emails, I would try my best to stay out of it. This is a very, very adult subject and one that you shouldn't even be remotely involved in.
As a mom myself, my heart breaks for you in this situation you find yourself in.

kh57217,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/192spo1/what_are_a_good_salary_range_in_tunisia/kh57217/,2,"Mahdia will be the cheapest overall in the Sahel. Sousse and Monastir are expensive during the high season for accommodation. 3-4k you will live comfortably if you are in a family. 

Let’s do some breakdown for two adults and two children: 

- a 2/3 bedroom nice apartment or house rent will be around 700-900 tnd, if you buy property and assuming you’re getting a mortgage from Algeria where interests rates are much better in per example Palm Lake resort in Monastir it will cost you roughly 1200 tnd a month to pay your mortgage 

- Bills including mobile phone, home internet, electricity, water, syndic will average to 300 a month 

- Groceries and house supplies will average 500 a month

- Car insurance, fees, taxes and fuel will cost 250 and depending on your usage 

- Eating out, entertainment, hobbies, activities for parents and the kids etc is another 300-400 (the beach is always free and watermelons are cheap in summer lol) 

- Education for your kids in public schools is roughly 12 tnd per kid annually and must be done in early August 


3-4k is an average middle class household income in Tunisia (both parents working). and in Mahdia or even smaller towns like Salakta you and your family will live comfortably with that wage.

It’s important to note that I’ve taken the higher average for prices than the middle or lower. Because in reality people can live completely on half that amount in a small town, you just need to live in a حومة شعبية and look for deals when shopping, use public transport or biking. There are direct low cost flights from Glasgow to Enfidha so maybe come check the area out and ask in person to be more sure.",2024-01-10 01:36:34

khfss44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/193lsj0/how_do_you_deal_with_doubts_about_religion/khfss44/,1,"Regarding life coming from water: 

In two verses the Quran states that Allah created every living thing from water: 

Have those who disbelieved not considered that the heavens and the earth were a joined entity, and We separated them and made from water every living thing? Then will they not believe?

Quran 21:30

Allah has created every [living] creature from water. And of them are those that move on their bellies, and of them are those that walk on two legs, and of them are those that walk on four. Allah creates what He wills. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent.

Quran 24:45

The key to understanding the meaning is the context apparent in the first verse, 21:30, which is about the creation of the world. Gabriel Said Reynolds notes in his academic commentary on the Quran an earlier parallel taught by the Syriac church father Ephrem (d. 373 CE). He writes, ""[...] Ephrem, who explains that God created everything through water: 'Thus, through light and water the earth brought forth everything.' Ephrem, Commentary on Genesis, 1:1-10).""[13] 

Ephrem's comment is in the context of the Genesis creation story, much like the first Quranic verse, 21:30. Ephrem says that when heaven and earth were created there were no trees or vegetation as it had not yet rained, so a fountain irrigated the earth. Tafsirs say that when the heaven and earth were separated rain fell so that plants could grow. 

There is also a similarity with Ephrem in the other verse (24:45), which mentions creatures that move on two, four or no legs. Ephrem explains that as well as the ""trees, vegetation and plants"", the ""Scripture wishes to indicate that all animals, reptiles, cattle and birds came into being as a result of the combining of earth and water"".[14] For many more parallels between the Quran and Syriac Christian literature see this article. 

Critics of the miracle claim sometimes also point out that the ancient Greek philosopher Anaximander proposed that the first living creatures were made from evapourated water.[15] 

Black holes and pulsars

Some modern Islamic scholars and popular voices, particularly Harun Yahya, have argued that the Quran 77:8 and Quran 86:1-3 contain an accurate description of black holes and pulsars. Quran 77:8 speaks of the stars being ""obliterated"" or ""effaced"" and Quran 86:1-3 speaks of a star of ""piercing brightness"". 

Critics have argued that neither of these verses imply anything other than the eschatological disappearance and observable brightness of stars, neither of which statements is particularly noteworthy. Indeed, it is said, that the sense of the word used in Quran 77:8 which means ""effaced"" even suggests a solid firmament above the Earth upon which the stars are some sort of sprinkled light. 

Critics also point out that the same verse (Quran 77:8) is interpreted by Islamic figures, including Yahya, to describe both black holes and pulsars and that this is plainly impossible as the two are in no way the same phenomenon.

Yusuf Ali: Then when the stars become dim; 

Corpus: So when the stars are obliterated, 

Daryabadi: So when stars are effaced.

Quran 77:8

By the Sky and the Night-Visitant (therein);- And what will explain to thee what the Night-Visitant is?- (It is) the Star of piercing brightness;-

khfsi8u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/193lsj0/how_do_you_deal_with_doubts_about_religion/khfsi8u/,1,"Regarding the expansion of the Universe: 

The universe is steadily expanding

Some modern Muslims scholars are of the opinion that the Quran had already told that universe has been constantly expanding even before this was discovered by modern science. 

They present the following verse as their proof: 

وَالسَّمَاءَ بَنَيْنَاهَا بِأَيْدٍ وَإِنَّا لَمُوسِعُون 
Muhammad Assad: AND IT IS We who have built the universe with [Our creative] power; and, verily, it is We who are steadily expanding it.

Quran 51:47

Zakir Naik writes regarding this verse: 

The Arabic word mûsi‘ûn (in verse 51:47) is correctly translated as ‘expanding it’, and it refers to the creation of the expanding vastness of the universe. Stephen Hawking, in his book, ‘A Brief History of Time’, says, “The discovery that the universe is expanding was one of the great intellectual revolutions of the 20th century.” The Qur’aan mentioned the expansion of the universe, before man even learnt to build a telescope!

The Quran and Modern Science by Zakir Naik

Mistranslation

Critics point out that some modern Quran translations have altered the meaning of 51:47 in four ways: 

They have translated the Quranic word “heaven سَّمَاءَ” as “universe”, which is not correct.

They have taken the Arabic noun “We are the expanders”, but turned it into the verb “The Universe is expanding,”

And then they added the entirely superfluous adverb “steadily” in an attempt to insert into the Quran additional ideas that are not actually there.

In any case the meaning of the word most like means vast or strong (as was understood in tafsirs)

With these four translational liberties, they have completely changed the meaning of this verse from a simple description of Allah’s creation of the heavens into a scientific statement of Hubble’s expanding universe that is not actually contained in the Quran. 

Critics point out that the term “lamūsi‘ūna لَمُوسِعُونَ ” in this verse is a noun and not a verb, and it describes ""God"" and not the ""heaven"" (i.e. the term “wa-innā lamūsi‘ūna وَإِنَّا لَمُوسِعُونَ” at best means ""God is the Expander"", and not ""the Universe is Expanding""). 

Thus the earlier Quran translators translated it as: 

Yusuf Ali: With power and skill did We construct the Firmament: for it is We Who create the vastness of space. 

Sahih International: And the heaven We constructed with strength, and indeed, We are [its] expander.

Pickthall: We have built the heaven with might, and We it is Who make the vast extent (thereof).

Quran 51:47

Moreover, the root word of لَمُوسِعُونَ (lamūsiʿūna) is و س ع (waw-sin-ayn), which Lane's lexicon of classical Arabic explains as to make ample room or width.[8] In the Quran, this word and its derivatives have elsewhere been used in the meanings of ""Encompassing"". 

This is seen in the following verses: 

وَسِعَ رَبِّى كُلَّ شَىْءٍ عِلْمًا 
Sahih Intl: My Lord encompasses all things in knowledge

Quran 6:80

Also see verses Quran 7:89 and Quran 20:98. 

In another verse the word ""احاط"" (encompass) has been used instead of ""wasi'a"" 

وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ قَدْ أَحَاطَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عِلْمًۢا
Sahih Intl: and that Allah has encompassed all things in knowledge.

Quran 65:12

ٖFor this reason, a few translators used this figurative meaning: 

Maududi: And heaven – We made it with Our Own Power and We have the Power to do so.
Abdul Majid Daryabadi: And the heaven! We have built it with might, and verily We are powerful.

Quran 51:47

Critics also point out that exactly the same grammar has been used in the next verse 51:48. 

Yusuf Ali: And We have spread out the (spacious) earth: How excellently We do spread out!

Quran 51:48

Pickthall: And the earth have We laid out, how gracious is the Spreader (thereof)!

Quran 51:48

In this verse, the word الْمَاهِدُونَ l-māhidūna (spreader/smoother) has exactly the same grammar [9] as the word لَمُوسِعُونَ lamūsiʿūna (i.e. expander) in the previous verse, but no one translated it as ""earth is steadily spreading out"". It is from the root mahada مهد which means to make plain, even, smooth, spread a bed[10]. Also from this root is the noun mahdan, meaning a bed or even expanse, which appears in other verses about the creation of Earth where it was made a bed in the past tense. The tense is clear in those verses to mean a past event rather than an ongoing process (Quran 20:53,Quran 43:10 and Quran 78:6-7). 

Universe consists of ""Space"", while the Quranic heaven is a solid canopy which could not expand

Critics also point out that according to science, the universe consists of space and galaxies are travelling away from each other in this space and thus it is considered as an expansion of the universe. 

However, the Quran heaven is a solid canopy: 

الذي جعل لكم الارض فراشا والسماء بناء وانزل من السماء ماء فاخرج به من الثمرات رزقا لكم فلا تجعلوا لله اندادا وانتم تعلمون 
Who has made the earth your couch, and the heavens your canopy; and sent down rain from the heavens; and brought forth therewith Fruits for your sustenance; then set not up rivals unto Allah when ye know (the truth). 

Quran 2:22

The word translated as canopy is binaa or binaan ( بِنَاء ). This word means ""building""[11]. Here, the heavens are described as a multi-story building over the earth. There are seven layers or stories to this building called the heavens. The heavens are built on a foundation called ""the earth"".",2024-01-11 23:30:20

Everyone in the seventh century knew it was impossible to survive without water.

Calculations of the mass deposited by subsequent impacts show that these impacts were comparatively insignificant in changing Earth's iron levels, making the claim false. Additionally, those impacts came from bodies originating within the Solar System - not around other stars.” 

https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/41234/did-all-iron-on-earth-come-from-outer-space 

Elements on Earth were either: 

1 - Present at Earth’s formation 

2 - Were formed on Earth 

3 - Came from outside (eg. meteors) 

The amount of iron that came from meteors is insignificant compared to the amount of it on Earth and barely any of it sank to the core. 

The Earth was formed out of debris around the solar protoplanetary disk which contained almost all minerals currently on Earth including iron. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Earth 

Iron is one of the 10 most common elements elements in the Solar system so it’s abundance on Earth is to expected.

khfhf35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/194cs75/travel_situation/khfhf35/,4,">all we see here on the news is the refugee crisis that occurs in Tunisia

That was long time ago.

- **The crisis isnt about refugees**.. it was about **illegal immigrants** who penetrate Tunisia in shady ways. Tunisia already hosts a lot of refugees. Please dont confuse a refugee (legal asylum) with an illegal immigrant. It is wrong to enter a country illegally and violate its laws. Tunisia is not a lawless state. Our laws apply to Tunisians and non-Tunisians.
- Now to the real crisis: the crisis of illegal immigrants in Tunisia: Tunisia is a a developing country with a low GDP per capita and big socioeconomic difficulties. Tunisians overthrew their government 13 years ago due to bad social and economic conditions. We are not a wealthy country like Western Europe or even Eastern Europe. We cant even afford a good quality of life to our citizens let alone illegal immigrants who use Tunisia as transit to reach Europe.
- There was a rise in the number of illegal immigrants and a formation of ghettos. Unfortunately many of these illegal immigrants were involved in [violent acts and crimes](https://fb.watch/lopuxEL6MA/?mibextid=NnVzG8). At first I thought some Tunisians were exagerating over this issue until I visited Sfax (a Tunisian city with so much illegal immigrants) myself for one day and saw myself a street fight myself involving >10 subsaharians. Some of these violent immigrants have clashed with locals.
- Tunisia is currently ruled by a populist (will be voted out this year hopefully) who tries to hide his economic failure by raising these fake topics. It is easier for a populist to just blame the illegal immigrants which triggered the response of Western media .. thus what you saw in the news months ago **not anymore today**
- The incidents with some subsahrian africans are condemnable but also isolated and by no mean represent Tunisians in general. I see dozens of subsaharians daily living peacefully here: attending our universities and working in restaurants, cafés... those kind of immigrants face no problems here and many are well integrated.

>if whether Tunisia is still possible to visit this year? 

What do you mean by still possible? Tunisia is not new to tourism. I see tourists every day and every season. Tourists are visiting Tunisia daily and you are welcome to visit of course.

khfguhw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/193lsj0/how_do_you_deal_with_doubts_about_religion/khfguhw/,1,"Read the text fully please.

One alleged miracle is as follows: ""The word rajul (man) and the word imra (woman) are both mentioned 24 times. That is a miracle and it means men and women are equal.""[1][2] 

The word count 24 is achieved by arbitrarily ignoring all dual and plural forms.

Forms with suffixes and prefixes are arbitrarily counted although in the 365 days miracle, they were not counted.

All the words meaning ""man"" with the root امر are ignored.

This word count includes the controversial word (رَجُلًا, rajulan) from the verse 7:155, which is in the singular form, but is clearly talking about seventy men (سَبْعِينَ رَجُلًا, sabAAeena rajulan).

The number 24 doesn't signify anything and seems to be a product of coincidence.

Equality in word count does not imply equality under law - and it is indeed the case that men and women are not valued equally under Islamic Law (see: Islam and Women). 

Male is mentioned 12 times in the singular and female is mentioned 18 times in the Quran.

The other alleged miracle is as follows: ""The word man and woman are both mentioned 23 times and in formation of an embryo 23 chromosomes are from the mother and 23 chromosomes are from the father.""[3] 

The word count for singular ""man"" can be 23 (if we don't count the controversial word in the verse 7:155, as mentioned earlier), but the word count for singular ""woman"" is 24.

The word count in this miracle contradicts the word count in the previous miracle.

Word Counts

The word man (rajul) in all its forms appears 55 times, while the word woman (imra 26 + nisa 59) 85 times.

The word ""woman"" unlike the word ""man"" is often in the form of ""my woman"", ""his woman"", ""your woman""... which decidedly implies the ""women are a property of men"" attitude.

Thus, word count is wrong.",2024-01-11 22:19:55

The historical Philistines only occupied Gaza.

The Egyptians used the term Peleset in the 12th-century BC to refer to a neighboring people or land. The Assyrians also called the same region ""Palashtu/Palastu"" since the 8th century BC. 

> ""Practically independent"" is not something that makes any sense or is historically accurate; it's revisionism. It had a regional flag, entirely different from the other Tunisian flags. Having a regional battalion does not make a region independent either, as that is the modus operandi in large nations or empires.

Most historians agree that all of the North African provinces of the Ottoman empire were highly autonomous. They had different political structures and waged war against each others. The modern day political division of the Maghreb (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya) dates back to the 16th century. 
The modern Tunisian army was formed in 1831 by Hussain II Bey. It wasn’t a “regional battalion”.

The chromosome miracle is not convincing for the simple reason of being utter nonsense produced by people who wanted to arrive to a certain conclusion and created evidence for it in any way possible. Why are the chromosomes important when it comes to a bee and a pig, but not for an elephantf? Elephant is mentioned in Quran. Why doesn't the elephant get to share in the chromosome counting? Why are the numbers in elephants interpreted as relating to gestation, instead of chromosomes? Or whale? What's with the whale discrimination? Why not do the chromosome magic with all the animals mentioned in Quran, if you want to make the chromosome counting a thing? By the way, the verse you provided speaks of sperm, but fascinatingly, Quran thinks that sperm comes from between the backbone and ribs and the book also has no bloody idea about the existence of the ovum, it doesn't think woman contributes that much of own material to the production of an embryo. The creator apparently knows no damn thing about creation, or a human body.

What follows is based on my own personal experiences with the majority of Sfaxian people I have encountered. It's crucial to recognise that individuals within any group can vary widely, and my observations are specific to certain encounters, not applying to all individuals from Sfax.


I have spent my entire life in Tunis, but I worked in an environment where approximately 50% of the employees were from Sfax or had Sfaxian backgrounds. Similarly, during my time at the pioneer high school (Lycée Pilote Bourguiba), a significant portion of my classmates were also Sfaxian. Not to mention the few friends that I have. From these interactions over the years, I noticed certain patterns.


First, they are good with finances and money management, which have been ingrained in them generation after generation within their own families since childhood. Secondly, Sfaxian families are generally highly competitive, pushing themselves to be the best among their peers and pushing their children to take school very seriously, achieve high scores, and pursue prestigious, high-paying careers.
This competitive environment, however, can create frustration and pressure especially among younger people which is something they express to their friends but never dare to speak to their families. Young women might find this especially frustrating since it can even go to the extent of impacting their private love life and turning into pressure to marry young into a wealthy Sfaxian family.


I have also observed what I perceive as malicious and cunning behaviours in most of them. They use ruses and tricks, lying straight to your face to get what they want. They have no genuine friends and find no problem using people to achieve their goals. They tend to take more than they give, even in simple matters.

While there seems to be a prioritisation of personal interests over genuine connections with others, this is not the case when dealing with fellow Sfaxians. Favouritism within their community is clear, not only in personal choices but also in professional settings, where certain individuals receive preferential treatment and more opportunities solely because they are also Sfaxian. This favouritism contributes to their success.


A few examples illustrate this point: I had a Sfaxian coworker who insisted on going back to Sfax for a simple dentist appointment, refusing an excellent one in Tunis. They strictly believe in using services and making purchases only from fellow Sfaxians.
A Sfaxian boss favoured our Sfaxian coworker, granting them more privileges than the rest of us.
In school, teachers paid more attention to students with typical Sfaxian family names (Kammoun, Hachicha, Besbes, Fakhfekh, etc.), possibly influenced by the fact that many teachers at Lycée Pilote come from Sfax.
In my workplace, most directors and higher-ups are Sfaxian, often favouring fellow Sfaxians for positions, even if objectively better candidates were available. It sometimes feels like a regional internal conflict, reaching a ridiculous extent.


I am not saying they're not hardworking, but from what I observed, some are and some aren't. The majority of the most hard working people I ever had the chance to work with were not from Sfax. Some Sfaxians are brilliant, and some are average, which is really much like anywhere else. My perception is that they are under significant pressure and highly competitive people who care a lot about their own image within their community, which leans them toward excelling academically and professionally.",2024-01-11 21:16:05

Maybe she was, but not anymore, and she made that clear. It was louder and clearer than whatever her intentions were with you before. She was given the chance to confess -if she did have feelings- but she chose not to.

This is why I suggest that you forget about her and move on. Try to keep things strictly professional. It would be hard to work together while things are very awkward and uncomfortable. I understand this might be challenging, and it's important to acknowledge the discomfort.

Consider reflecting on this experience for personal growth. This kind of thing happens a lot, don't worry.
You can maybe express your regret and apologise if you made her feel uncomfortable. You can try to set together clear boundaries through open communication. That might help alleviate the tension and reduce the awkwardness on a professional level. My suggestion for you for the future (and I say this sadly based on my own experience): avoid mixing your professional life with your love life. Not many people are mature enough to handle such a thing without it affecting work and if things don't go as planned, it often ends badly for everyone and ruins the whole mood at work.",2024-01-11 20:10:19

So when i got my first job as engineer i dropped my salary by about 500 or sth , i told them i will be getting benefits like phd assistance and flexible time etc 
When my parents asked me for some money i gave them , i also have the habit of buying some groceries , olive oil , meat for a fancy meal once a month ( i go home once at around half the month , so i bring some stuffs to please them as well ) 
The idea is to keep the real income a secret and share a small bit with them while also detailing your expenses and inflating them a little so you have room for hard times or special occasions without forgetting they are your family and it is never gona hurt to help a little or share a bit ( قال الرسول عليه الصلاة و السلام خير المال ينفقه المرء ينفقه على اهل بيته )

Having a regional battalion does not make a region independent either, as that is the modus operandi in large nations or empires. In the U.S. and Soviet Union/ Russian Federation, states and oblasts have their own military battalions, local governments, flags, and anthems. None of them are independent.

How can one claim descent from a nation from the Middle Ages that ceased to exist for almost a half a millenium? (Again, I am *not* making the argument that Tunisia is a fake nation. I *am* pointing out the hypocrisy in your logic.) 

Israel is the *only* successor of the *only* independent state in the region. Unless you consider Israel/Palestine part of Syria?

Hamas goal is not the establishment of am Islamic Sharia Law state either? And if you are talking about their fanaticism and hardline embrace of Islam it is related directly to oppression, many people try to relate Hamas to ISIS and the Islamic brotherhood, firstly, ISIS and Hamas are not the same in any shape or form, not on their goals, not in their methods not in their idiology.

>**2- Fallega weren't a puppet in Iran's hand, which has killed many people in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen.** (It's OK to get support from anyone, but Hamas and Islamic Jihad have gone too far and are now a puppet in Iran's hands.)

That's a new buzz word that the west is pushing because Iran is the new Boogeyman of the west. Hamas existed and operated before even Iran started spreading their influence in the Middle East.
And being supported by a foreign power does not make you a puppet of them, because this logic can be also applied by Russia and other imeprialists to justify themselves grabbing smaller nations.

The Hamas government in Gaza has been reliant on the PA to help provide electricity in Gaza, with import duties on Gaza's fuel purchased via Israel being collected by Israel, as per Protocol on Economic Relations, which are passed to the PA, which pays the bills to Israel and Egypt for the electricity they supply to Gaza. In April 2017, the PA ceased paying the electricity bills issued by Israel Electric Corporation (IEC) and by Egypt.[5] This decision was reversed in January 2018.[6])

Wrong, very wrong and here is a full analysis of it:

1. The Oslo Accords were not an offer of statehood. It established the PA as an interim authority during the 5-year 'transitional period' for negotiating a permanent settlement. No such settlement was ever reached, and Israel never made an offer. 
2. This was the closest that Israel ever got to actually offering Palestinian statehood. The 'state' that Israel offered in the 2000 summit was 5 discontinuous areas of land. Palestine would not have sovereignty over any part of Jerusalem, and Israel would maintain sovereignty of all airspace. In addition, Israel would be allowed to build permanent radar stations inside of Palestine, be allowed to deploy troops in Palestinian territory in 'emergency' situations, and maintain control of all water resources in the West Bank. Palestine would not be allowed to maintain a military, sign international treaties without Israeli approval, or allow any foreign military west of the Jordan River. That's not statehood. The agreement also would have required that Palestine make no future demands against Israel, permanently barring the possibility of full statehood. 
3. The Taba Talks lasted 7 days before they were ended by Israel in advance of the Israeli election. The Likud party was elected, and they chose not to restart the negotiations. 
4. Israel did not accept the roadmap. They approved accepting some portions of the roadmap with the addition of 14 provisions, which included a demilitarized Palestine, Israeli sovereignty over 30% of Gaza and more than 50% of the West Bank, a full cessation of violence on the Palestinian side but not the Israeli side, no negotiations on borders, complete replacement of the PA leadership, and full Israeli control of all borders, airspace, and communications. These weren't even their conditions for accepting Palestinian statehood. These were the conditions they demanding for entering into negotiations. 
5. Israel made no offer of statehood at the Annapolis Conference. Palestine made a proposal that discussed statehood. Israel only offered a peace treaty. Neither proposal was adopted. 
6. The Kerry negotiations led to Kerry proposing six parameters for restarting peace talks in 2016. Netanyahu rejected the proposal outright and criticized Kerry for attacking Israeli.

""As a Norwegian who moved to the Czech Republic, I would say that yes, the Czech Republic is a good place to live. 

The Czech Republic is a safe country - you're allowed to speak your mind, and you can walk around without fearing being mugged/attacked (you can be unlucky anywhere in the world, but a fact is that the Czech Republic is a very safe country) Indeed, it even scores higher on the Global Peace Index than my home country. I have personally never been the victim of any form of crime either back home in Norway or here in the Czech Republic, but the city where I live now (Brno) feels safer. Sure, Oslo has more than twice the population than Brno, but both are modern European cities with their own problems. Violent crime is, unfortunately, more likely to happen in Oslo than in Brno, and probably Prague and other Czech cities. If we put the topic of crime and perceived safety behind us, and focus on other things, I would also say that some of the good things about the Czech Republic is the separation of church and state, the varied nature we can find across the country and here I also refer to the many hiking paths! The level of unemployment is one of the lowest in Europe, so you probably won't struggle to find a job as long as you have a marketable skill. I personally had a job ready for me before I moved here. 

Even in Brno, a relatively small city, there are loads of activities, restaurants, pubs, and other things to do and experience. Prague definitely has more on offer, but you also have to accept the fact that Prague is one of the most popular cities to visit in Europe, so there are tourists ""everywhere"", well, at least in the more central areas. I'm not the one to comment on it, but I presume that the rental prices in Prague are rather high compared to rest of the country. 

Coming from a country where ""everything"" can be handled online, I find the modernisation of official offices to be lacking, but this seems to improve. In general I also find the quality of goods in my local shops to be quite bad when comparing it to what we can buy in Austria or Germany, although I know I can get better quality foodstuffs from the larger hypermarkets or online delivery services/farmer shops. It certainly is useful to know a thing or two about cars, mechanics, plumbing, or other skills unless you want to get ripped off by unscrupulous salesmen/craftsmen -- they won't hesitate to rip you off if you don't know what you're talking about. This is something I've rarely encountered in Norway. Traffic is shit, and the city isn't scaled for the amount of drivers, this causes a lot of jams and in turn bad air quality and noise. Motorways and main thoroughways seem to be under repair/construction 24/7/365. Thankfully, public transportation is good and cheap in the larger cities. 

As a Norwegian, the cultural differences between the Czech Republic aren't that big, so I presume they will be even smaller for a Pole. Make sure your job pays enough for you to have a roof over your head, groceries, savings and some entertainment and you're good to go.""",2024-01-11 17:06:55

**2- Fallega weren't a puppet in Iran's hand, which has killed many people in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen.** (It's OK to get support from anyone, but Hamas and Islamic Jihad have gone too far and are now a puppet in Iran's hands.)

**3- Fallega are Tunisians.**

khd9hi1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1942b8n/alech_tounes_na_pas_participé_avec_lafrique_du/khd9hi1/,-1,"Here’s ChatGPT’s answer:

The ICJ is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations and its role is to settle legal disputes submitted to it by states in accordance with international law.

For a country to initiate a case at the ICJ, like the one South Africa has brought against Israel, a few key conditions generally need to be met:

1. **Jurisdiction of the Court**: The ICJ must have jurisdiction over the case. This can be established either through specific treaties that both parties have ratified (like the Genocide Convention in the South Africa-Israel case) or through special agreements to submit the dispute to the ICJ.

2. **Standing of the State**: The state bringing the case must have standing, meaning it must be significantly affected by the issue at hand or have a legitimate interest in the matter.

3. **Exhaustion of Diplomatic Remedies**: Usually, states are expected to attempt to resolve their disputes through diplomatic channels before approaching the ICJ.

As for why Tunisia or any other specific country has not initiated a case, this can depend on various factors:

- **Diplomatic Considerations**: Countries may weigh the diplomatic repercussions of bringing a case to the ICJ against another country, especially if the accused country is a significant global player or holds considerable influence.
  
- **Legal Strategy and Priorities**: The decision to initiate legal action at an international level might be influenced by a country's legal strategy, priorities, and its assessment of the potential success of such a case.
  
- **Political Will and International Support**: Political will and the level of international support or opposition can play a significant role in a country's decision to pursue legal action at the ICJ.

- **Resources and Expertise**: Engaging in international litigation requires considerable resources and legal expertise, which might influence a country's decision.

The specific reasons for Tunisia or other countries not initiating a case similar to South Africa's against Israel would depend on their individual assessments and circumstances, including their foreign policy priorities and diplomatic relations.",2024-01-11 14:50:08

The Hamas government in Gaza has been reliant on the PA to help provide electricity in Gaza, with import duties on Gaza's fuel purchased via Israel being collected by Israel, as per Protocol on Economic Relations, which are passed to the PA, which pays the bills to Israel and Egypt for the electricity they supply to Gaza. In April 2017, the PA ceased paying the electricity bills issued by Israel Electric Corporation (IEC) and by Egypt.[5] This decision was reversed in January 2018.[6])

>The West Bank is Palestinian territory by the united nations. Israel is illegally operating there as an invading army and by the way here is what ""protecting themselves"" look like in the west bank.

Okay let's set it clear they never accepted the un partition so which territory u're talking about n the west bank was ruled by jordan they waged wars n lost it n israel took it but let's pretend for a moment it is a palestinian territory, it was a palestinian territory before waging useless wars they will never win lmao, so in ur mind israel should accept their attacks n wars with open arms without even responding, they won the war n in order to protect themselves they need to demolish n invite settlers n army, jordan n egypt learnt the lesson of waging useless wars will lead to nothing when will balestinians learn it lol (even tho it is too late imo enough is enough).

They chose war over n over n over again since the establishment of the jewish state they never accepted the un partition n every time the two-state solution comes to light they reject it n wage wars, yes they are terrorist u should be blind to not believe that or a terrorist sympathizer pick which one u are.

I started a new job last year and on my first day this coworker came to me and said « you will be reporting to me and I am your manager » ama hiya she is not my manager at all, she is just more senior than me and we work on the same project. I didn’t say anything since it was my first day and I didn’t want any trouble yet. She spent the first few weeks assigning me tasks that she should be doing and other things not in my job description (photocopies, 9ahwa, etc.) until my actual manager came from abroad (she is the regional director and lives in another country and comes to Tunisia a few times a year). I asked to sit down with her and asked her « who is my actual manager and who is allowed to assign tasks to me? Is it ´coworker name ‘? And from there we started a discussion that led to my manager privately asking my coworker to stop bothering me.
From time to time this coworker still tries to be disrespectful to me and I just brush it off and say no gently and ignore her.
My main advice to you is don’t cause a scene in a professional setting as it might badly reflect with your managers, if it goes too far privately talk to your coworker and say that you are not comfortable with the way she talks to you. It neither of these work, ask for an informal meeting with your manager and share your grievances but always be the better person. Here’s a example of what you can say to your manager « I’m happy to be part of the team and work but sometimes there are challenges dealing with some coworkers. While I cannot cross boundaries with these people, is it possible for you to step in »

And yes, by law you can toss your child out as soon as they hit 18 but you must be the most fucked up human being to do so. Most 18-year-olds can't live alone because of how stupid our societies are and they barely know anything about real life and literally they are children and can't do shit so in reality it's still the parents' responsibility to take care of them even after 18 until they find their first job and slowly get into the adult life. You clearly lived such a rough life and I feel sorry for you, but this isn't normal, buddy.   


Stop thinking of people as properties and think of them as sentient human beings that are alive being brought to this world without their consent and you'll get how fucked up what you said is. You brought a sentient being to life you take care of it till they are able to take care of themselves and it's not a favor you do, it's by force and if you don't want to take care of children then don't give birth.",2024-01-11 13:07:20

khcupxa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1940wre/some_advice/khcupxa/,4,"I've been in the same situation when I started my job. A colleague, although she joined one year earlier, was assigned by the manager to provide us with assistance since we were new. The first couple of months were horrible with her. She was patronizing and judgemental of the quality of my work even when the manager appreciates my code, gossiping, she'd said it has something lacking or not persistent. The other new colleague and I were really pissed, and soon altercations started. I've been trying to tell her to fuck off in the most professional way, refused to backup her when she was not available, which she took personally. Also I didn't hesitate to report to the manager in the 1-2-1 evaluation sessions.

Soon enough, the manager separated us, it's been a year now, any discussion between us that doesn't concern work wouldn't exceed ""bonjour"".

So bro, my advice is to keep ignoring her, tell her to fuck off in a professional way (I have urgent deadlines, I can't assist with you I have tight timeline. Don't hesitate to report to the boss the personal actions she's commiting and that she's treating you in an intimidating way.

Yes.   


I am aware that some of the french culture is already present in our everyday life. And that's fine to be honest, Tunisia took a lot of cultures that installed themselves in Tunisia (either due colonialism like France, Empires shifts like the Ottoman Empire, Roman Empire or people that immigrated to Tunisia like the Moors etc..) and I think it's beautiful to be honest and it made us connect with around of civilizations in the modern days. But my big point is adopting and idolizing french culture won't make us Tunisian liberals. It will make us French-like conservatives.   


> I read so much Tunsians who seem ashamed of what they are. 

Well some Tunisians are ashamed of what they are. But I wouldn't say the majority is ashamed. I would say they are underestimating themselves and what they have to offer. And it is manifested in small details. For example, studying and presentations and everything that has to do with professionalism should be done in French. If you talk French people will see as smart, educated or something in that sense. If you would suggest to adopt Tunisian Dialect for these things, you'd have someone argumenting that Tunisian dialect is for the streets. Personally I think it's a shame because Tunisian dialect is a beautiful mixture between arabic, french, turkish, amazigh, italian and spanish. Maltese Language is veeeeeery close to Tunisian Dialect btw. (Yes, Tunisians are not aware that they speak another language which is maltese by just merely existing). I could name a lot of examples that are soo simple. But these simple details are in the Tunisian unconciousness that they manifest in other forms. That's why when a Tunisian would try to manufacture a vehicle, you'll find a non negligeable amount of people that will make fun of him.

Not because they are terrorists, they are terrorists, but they are fighting Israel which is a state that was founded and continues to exist because of zionist terrorism so yeah it will be stupid to expect them not to employ terrorism ( I think they are also often unnecessarily violent especially towards gazan opposition). However I find them to be ideological fundamentalist blinded by violence and to a great degree do not care for their people. I remeber once in Egypt a hama official was asked why don't you build in addition to the tunnels some underground shelters and the hamas official said:"" It is not our job to protect the palestinian people, it is the job of the UN"" TF you mean it is not ur job? Hamas's existing represents the natural violent ideological turn that subjugated people take under similar circumstances for that I don't think they have anything of value to say or to add that a sane person can't figure out by themselves and their existing can represent a danger for Tunisian civilians",2024-01-11 08:29:08

khby8on,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/193lsj0/how_do_you_deal_with_doubts_about_religion/khby8on/,3,"It can be a mental burden to have doubts in a religion that's deeply engrained in your life, community and background. You were raised on it for most of your life, and it is what everyone around you follows and believes to be the unquestionable and ultimate truth. However, it's important to stay true to yourself and your values. Your own beliefs significantly impact your life and wellbeing, so prioritise finding what resonates with you.




For your truth-seeking journey, I suggest you do your research about different other religions and belief systems. You will see that they can also have amazing values and teachings (otherwise people wouldn't have believed in them in the first place) and they might align more with your values and needs in your life right now. Find the ones that bring you feelings of comfort and conviction, even if they look a little different from what everyone else is doing.

Additionally, exploring different beliefs can be an eye-opening experience. It will open a door to a whole new library of ancient wisdom, modern interpretation and diverse ideas. You might stumble upon things that click with you in ways you never expected. 

Remember, that doesn't mean you necessarily have to throw away your religious background. Islam, or any other path, is always there waiting for you if it still feels like home. You can get back to islam with a renewed faith and this journey can even re-strengthen your belief in it.




And don't worry, you're not alone in this—there are tons of resources and communities out there ready to lend a hand, no matter where your path takes you.
Here are some ideas to get you started, you can choose whatever resonates with you:

* For a personal and spiritual perspective: explore mystical traditions (like Sufism or Kabbalah) which emphasise devotional practices.

* For a deeper connection to nature and the universe: delve into Earth-based spiritualities, pantheism, Taoism, or other traditions that revere the natural world.

* For more focus on your own well-being and inner peace: Buddhism, mindfulness practices, and even some Stoic philosophy can offer tools for cultivating mental and emotional well-being.

* Within Islam itself: there are many different schools of thought like Sunni, Shia, or Sufi traditions. Each offers unique interpretations and practices. Maybe you'll find your answers there.


There are countless paths out there, so please be patient, keep an open mind and always trust your intuition. The most important thing is to find what brings you closer to your truth and makes you feel alive.

I hope this helps!",2024-01-11 07:04:40

khbex8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/193lsj0/how_do_you_deal_with_doubts_about_religion/khbex8b/,1,"My apologies. I tend to confuse Byzantines with Persians in this context. 

*Alif, Lam, Meem. The Romans (Byzantines) have been defeated in the nearest land. But they, after their defeat, will overcome within three to nine years. To Allah belongs the command before and after. And that day the believers will rejoice.* ([Quran 30:1-5](https://legacy.quran.com/30/1-5))

These verses from Surah Ar-Rum are said by Muslims to be ironclad proof of Islam; a true prophecy of a Byzantine military defeat and their later victory in the Byzantine-Sassanid war. 

However, there is a major problem with this ‘prophecy’. According to the Islamic sources it was actually revealed ***after*** the Romans has already won the victory. 

>Narrated 'Atiyyah: Abu Sa'eed narrated: **""On the Day of Badr, the Romans had a victory over the Persians. So the believers were pleased with that, then the following was revealed**: 'Alif Lam Mim. The Romans have been defeated, up to His saying: 'the believers will rejoice - with the help of Allah... (30:1-5)'"" He said: ""So the believers were happy with the victory of the Romans over the Persians."" (https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:3192). **Grade: Sahih**

A[SECONDhadith](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:2935), graded hasan,  likewise repeats that the ‘prophecy’ came down *after* the Byzantine victory on the day of Badr. One Muslim response to this is to attempt to attack the integrity of the above ahadith by saying that one of the narrators, Atiyah bin Saad Al Awu’fi is weak. Yet, we find that Atiyah is actually well respected in [the books of a great many Sunni scholars](https://dhulfikarmashriqi.wordpress.com/2020/08/07/atiyah-bin-saad-al-awufi-an-oppressed-narrator/), supporting the high grading of these ahadith. There is also a [THIRD hadith](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:3193), graded sahih, that likewise indicates the revelation occurred on the day of Badr.

So, we find three strong hadith indicating that the Qur’anic ‘prophecy’ is no prophecy at all, but a falsehood that emerged *after* the very event it was meant to predict.

 Therefore, we can pack up and go home, right? No.

 In true Islamic fashion there is ANOTHER hadith, a somewhat contradictory one which actually attempts to place the prophecy as first coming down in Mecca *prior* to the predicted events (http://qaalarasulallah.com/hadithView.php?ID=33407). This sounds better for the Muslims, but in true Islamic fashion, it does not work at all. 

The Meccan hadith states the following:

- ”Abu Bakr and the idolaters made a bet, and they said to Abu Bakr: 'What do you think - Bid' means something between three and nine years, so let us agree on the middle.' So they agreed on six years; **Then six years passed without the Romans being victorious**.

 The idolaters took what they won in the bet from Abu Bakr. When **the seventh year came and the Romans were finally victorious over the Persians**, the Muslims rebuked Abu Bakr for agreeing to six years. He said: 'Because Allah said: 'In Bid' years.' At that time, many people became Muslims.""

On this basis, we can determine that as the Byzantine victory occurred on the day of Badr (624 AD), according to this hadith, the Qur’anic prophecy came seven years earlier in 617 AD. 

But how do these dates make sense for Mecca? In reality, within FIVE YEARS of 617, the Muslims would flee to Medina, so how is it that Abu Bakr is now depicted as being in Mecca in year six (623 AD) to pay the wager? Skirmishing actually started between Mecca and Medina that year. 

The hadith makes no mention of the hijra at all and even implies the Muslims are STILL in Mecca in year seven (624 AD)! Consequently, the content of this hadith is provably false due to it being completely ahistorical.

So, in summary, Muslims are faced with two choices:

- (1) Go with the weight of evidence that the Qur’anic verses were first given at Badr *after* the Byzantine victory, making it a fake prophecy.
- ⁠(2) Go with the Meccan hadith that is obviously false because it has people in places where they should not be and deletes the entire hijra.

There’s too many problems with this whole prophecy.",2024-01-11 04:10:20

Asking her for money and how much she makes are two different things. He's probably assigned to do that by her father, since she refused to tell anyone.

> As a man I would never 

Let's stop that bullshit. If you're going to inherit the woke agenda bullshit from the west, inherit all of it, don't cherry pick the ones you like. There's no ""as a man"" or ""as a woman"" because the moment a person would say ""as a woman she should"" he'll be called sexist so I'm not even gonna discuss that with you.

> they shouldn't have children if they can not provide 

They never said they can't provide and nothing is certain 100%. Everything in life has a risk. You could be making millions today and tomorrow you'd be homeless which should never be a reason for not having children or literally anything in life. In OP's case the mother is deceased which no one would've foreseen.  

> did she ask to be born

No one asks to be born and there's something called human decency. If someone is taking care of you your whole life (and you technically owe them your literal life) must have power over you man or a woman. You can't have it both ways. You can't be 100% free and having a private life while at the same time living rent-free under someone else's roof who you don't deem trust worthy enough to let them know your salary. It sounds like she's using them till she actually can live on her own waiting to cut off ties with them as soon as possible.

> when I started work at 15 I bought my siblings everything my parents could not afford and bought food for the house. And all that because I wanted better for them. And I did that because my parents told me they don't want my money they want me to save for my future. 

And? How did you manage to make the whole thing about you? It's not about you. Any half decent human being would've done the same. Any half decent parents would've done the same. No one ever said that she must give all of her money to her father. No one. But as a half decent human being, she's entitled to carry her own weight and make up for past years he took care of her (nevertheless on her own without being asked to). 

> Real parents don't ask their children to pay for a life they decided to have.  

The father didn't. But, again, as a decent human being you're entitled to buy your parents stuff because it will make them happy and you're technically paying a dept.

> don't think they should ask her 

No, they should. It's only natural to ask someone who's really close to you (aka your parent/daughter) who just scored a new job for the salary to evaluate how good of a job it is. Even close friends share that (and I bet if she has a very close friend she probably have told them already).

This is actually not true at all, there is ONE claim about this and it's in an old manuscript in the India office library in London (Arabic, 2807, 152-173) and was quoted in a book called ""Muhammad Rasullulah"" and written by Mohamed Hamidullah.

The claim is that the legenday king of India Chakrawati Farmas (he is also known by Cheraman Perumal afaik) witnessed this event happen.

Thing is, almost every historian alive who tried to trace back when Chakrawati Farmas lived came to the conclusion that he lived in the 9th century, 2 centuries after the prophet Mohamed's death.

There is also one other stupid claim from a muslim PDF  about how chinese astronomers when ""Sun Wu Kong"" who was the king at the time saw it happen with his own eyes"".

It's certainly the case that they don't have enough foreign currency reserves available to import without accepting more IMF loans, without which the coffers of the large majority of other options for both multi- and bilateral loans too become unavailable (as most require a good standing with the IMF). I think anyone in Tunisia who's engaged in any sort of economic work/analysis/fields/circles see this as a completely uncontroversial fact. That's of course why the few institutions that are willing to loan Tunisia money still are able to do so at a higher interest rate.

What they're trying to achieve, I think, is to slowly wane Tunisia off of the debt spiral its gotten progressively more and more caught into since 2014, but doing so without 1: engaging in any sort of radical moves that would shake relations with the EU and US too much, 2: losing power to opportunists who claim they'll be able to sort it all quickly, but whose plan in reality is to just take another IMF loan and continue the starvation of the public sector in the service of the wealthy, and 3: avoid having to educate the Tunisian population on the complicated economics and political implications of dealing with debt and especially with the IMF (hence the stupid conspiracies).

But yeah, for the most part imo, it feels like it's going to be at least a solid handful more years of these shortages that aren't severe enough to really endanger the people, but also are severe enough that they're a constant nuissance and gives everyone the feeling of living in a failed state whose development is completely stalled.

Yes you got that right. Also definitely lying about the reason why they didn't import because there was a huge reduction in funding for imports so the cheque story is the president's newest wild goose chase to distract from the real reason they couldn't pay.

> And what are they trying to achieve with that ?

They don't have the money to buy those imports so I guess you could say what they're trying to achieve is not defaulting on foreign debts.

At [14:30](https://youtu.be/DjDQeWQauRI?t=865), Saied mentions a key information that the money that was supposed to be used as guarantee for the loan was sent to the state owned sugar company (Société tunisienne du sucre). It's apparently shocking to the president despite him personally pushing to fund this state company first of all and more importantly this clearly shows that there was a decision to be made between coffee and sugar, both having shortages at the time. This of course contradicts the president's claim in the video above at the coffeeshop when asked about sugar and coffee shortages.

On the other hand, the claim that the cheque from Bank Isken was the issue is vague at best. The president says it's a cheque not a bank draft so it's not clear whether the money was available afterwards. More importantly at [17:00](https://youtu.be/DjDQeWQauRI?t=1018) Saied mentions that money was taken out instead of going into the Amen bank account and that obviously will make Amen Bank say that OCT was not serious. They needed the money somewhere else and this proves there was indeed financial difficulties contrary to what the president follows up with at [18:38](https://youtu.be/DjDQeWQauRI?t=1117) saying the money was there. Finally, after talking about what is clearly financial and import issues for 10min, Saied concludes that [18:45](https://youtu.be/DjDQeWQauRI?t=1125) that the issue is with distribution and e7tikar.",2024-01-12 21:16:21

I know that your post is mostly hyperbole to make a point. I also understand that it comes from frustration when facing the current recession. However, that does not change the fact that things are more complicated than you make them to be.

1* there is no 3 € cancer drug. That does not exist. Cancer is far more complicated than that.

2* when you visit a doctor, you are not getting 10 mn of attention. You are getting 10+ years worth of studying, clinical rotations and night shifts. You are not paying for 10 mn. You are paying for the 10 years that made those 10 mn possible. ""BuT I dOn T gIvE A sHiT AboUT DoCtorS NeEDiNg 10 YeARs tO bE AbLe tO DiAgNoS mE"". In that case, you can go to the first rando that you meet on the street and ask them to treat you. You get what you pay for. Or you can visit the affordable public hospital. It costs 3 Dt to see a doctor there. You have to wait a full day for a 10mn visit and you get the drugs for free. But again, you get what you pay for. In the private sector you pay for convinience, time saved and the fruit of 10+ years of knowledge. You get more in the private sector, so you have to pay more.

A basic concept in life : You can not get ""Cheap"", ""Fast"" and ""Good quality"", all at once. You only get two of those at once.

3* The 200 dt + prescription is a product of the average patient in tunisia. If the patient pays 60 dt to end up with a 3 dt prescription, they will feel scammed. They will not visit that doctor anymore. Now, if they get a 100 dt prescription, they will feel that they got what they paid for. Subconscioucly, they will think that doctor is a better one.

Now, it is not exactly a tunisian thing. It's more of a human thing. We tend to value ""expensive"" stuff far more than ""cheap"" stuff, regardeless of the actual quality.",2024-01-12 20:18:43

- Get Tunisian license
- Once in germany, do a Umschreibung einer ausländischen Fahrerlaubnis in your closest Bürgeramt.
- Go to a driving school and tell them you want to do an Umschreibung. This means:
   - No need for a minimum amount of hours.
   - No need for theory hours, you can just study by yourself and go do the exam.
   - The instructor will take you on one hour to see where youre at in practice. If youre really lucky/good they can request the exam for you right away. I needed like 5 hours though.

Cost me around 500 bucks total. Driving with the tunisian one is not allowed as soon as you do an Anmeldung/stay longer than 6 months.

No, many of them aren't illegal immigrants. Many of them are students and ordinary workers who have lived in the country for a long time. In fact, even many black Tunisians have been subjected to unfair treatment and racial slurs because of their skin colour. 

But let's say I am wrong and all of them are in fact illegal immigrants, that doesn't make it okay to brutally throw all of them out overnight and put them all together in the desert like cockroaches without giving them food and water. There is something called the right of asylum. They have the right to seek asylum if they want to and if they are not granted asylum, then after that you can deport them in a legal and civilized way. That's how things work in a somewhat civilized society.

Also, don't you see that approaching every black person on the street in an intimidating and violent way while asking them to identify themselves, is in itself very problematic and a very racist act?",2024-01-12 17:46:13

Basically all of europe health sector is crumbling around them and the only ppl eking out are the french because WE make up 80% of their doctors and health care providers. For france there wont be any stats on this coz they dont make ehrnic/racial based census (ofc else they would realise its built on our backs) but for the uk (national health service) 20% of doctors are not british. Not even immigrants yet. They literally dont have british nationality. Among the 80% rest most of them are immigrants or 2nd gen immigrants. https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-7783/ 

This is the uk so imagine how it is in france if there were ethnic based stats.

Also in the west, if by pure misfortune you have a zionist doctor (yk who actually owns and runs most public and private hospitals right) there are testimonials and lawsuit happening that they purposefully misdiagnosed arab black and brow muslims by having unnecessary organs removed or amputations or even giving them really painful procedures

It's also silly because Tunisians actually loved illegal immigrants too when they could exploit them to death and pay them little to nothing for jobs that tunisians didn't want to do anymore and then kicked them to the curb with the slightest inconvience. 

And about Tunisian harraga , yes I actually condone that behaviour , I always condone the search of a better life , if you had lived in some popular neighborhood , you'd see the struggle some people had to go through everyday , the poverty , the lack of opportunities and chances to the point where life and death become equal.As much as I don't encourage it , I do understand why people resort to it.

However , what I do not understand/tolerate is countries depriving me from my right to roam freely , the social and racial profiling that happens during visa procedures and all the humiliation that everyone has to go throught for a 3-day interance to some country , and rejection of people who were already accpeted for jobs , universities then get their visas declined for no reason at all.",2024-01-12 15:07:46

I'm 33 years old now. I bought all the kid magazines I could as a kid (including this one). I could get some of the major comic books from France even, as well as any other global pop-culture hit that reached Tunisia.

I was raised in a completely non-political, religiously indifferent family and environment, with no ideological indoctrination whatsoever in my childhood. No religious education in anything except in state schools. I was not even in the كشافة. Nothing. Except the ""5obzist"" Tunisian mentality of the 90s. The objective to ""Study, have good grades, graduate and have a good paying job in an office somewhere, fuck everything else"". So you can say I was as neutral about the matter as one could as a kid. The only thing peculiar about me compared to my peers was that I personally liked to read ever since primary school, so I just read whatever I could lay hands on, whether it was from the East, or the West. 

As a very young kid, I was seeing Ben Ali's pictures on these magazines and everywhere else, and I read those articles that glorify him. I bought his propaganda line hook, line and sinker. I really thought he was a hero. But as I kept reading, thinking about all things around me, and contrasting his supposed accomplishments with the reality of my environment and Tunisia as a whole, I figured out by myself (at the age of 12) that the propaganda of Ben Ali, of the ""progress"" he did, and his cult of personality was mostly a sham (I didn't even have access at the time to Internet, any book about Tunisian political history, or any family member who had a stake in hating Ben Ali). From then on, the more the years went on, the more I became convinced. 

Bourguiba for me took more time because Ben Ali erased most the information about him in the public sphere, and there was only the minimum info about him in the history curriculum (I kid you not, the first time I even knew he existed was the day he died). After we started learning about him in the official curriculum, I didn't take much time after to start reading some historical books about him and his era to know more (I read everything that I could get my hands on, some pro-Bourguiba, some anti. With the help of the internet ofc). By the time I was 17, I had my final opinion on him, his ideology, and the ideologies of the West as a whole (big thumbs down). And again, without anyone IRL helping me whatsoever  (Though ofc I can't claim I knew all of the details, history, and specifics back then, but with the Internet and daily readings/exposure to everything I could, from East and West, my opinion did solidify as the years went on).

Oh, and all the tunisian, french, and foreign comics/tv-shows/books that I knew of still couldn't (and wouldn't) prevent me from reaching those conclusions, though deliberating all the messages in them until I felt I was finally fair to them took me some years.

If a kid in this era had no indoctrination or stakes from his family or peers like I did, and with the help of the internet and books that are available from an earlier age than what was possible in our era (and without censorship), I reckon that if he was sincere and never stopped reading until he was certain, he could at least figure out both Ben Ali and Bourguiba before reaching 17 years, if not 12. Let alone if he was a true born genius (I ain't this), or if he had some help from a mentor so that he can start by reading only the most relevant material (and not just brute-force read through everything like I did).",2024-01-12 14:24:09

General advice, you have to be more responsible than this, and use some kind of contraceptive solution (there are many), the obvious one is the daily pill, but if she is trying to hide this from her entourage, she might get in trouble if someone stumble upon them, plus they have side effects on fertility, specially if she uses them for a long time, so she needs to check with a doctor, obviously, if we are still trying to keep it a secret, don't go to a doctor where you can meet people you know (doctors have to keep your situation secret, it is the law, and they can't just divulge that to the family, if she is not a minor). There is also the IUD (stérilet) that can be installed by a doctor, but just don't forget about it if we are still keeping this secret, and she has to undergo an X ray scan, it shows in X Rays. Keep in mind that all these are not 100% efficient.

If you are not exclusive, you must use protection, and this should not be debatable.

And on a side note, if you choose not to use any contraceptive solution, and count on the regularity of her menstrual cycle, let me present you to 4 of my (married) friends who had accidental pregnancies even though they were very careful and organised and had very regular cycles.

For a lot of time, all types of drones were banned, and holders of drones are severely punished, while in other countries, small drones are not prohibited, and if used in a way that may harm other people, then sanctions can be enforced. This makes total sense.

So if you as a government, are afraid of people laundering money, may be you should be more careful about suspicious transactions, and just ban the use of foreign cards all together. That's why laws are stupid in Tunisia. As a law maker, you should not be putting barriers everywhere, you should be facilitating life, proposing solutions, and those who misbehave, and only those who misbehave are sanctioned. We have a wrong perception of the role of the state and the government and law makers, their job is not that of the police, their job is to find solutions, create and modify laws to make things easy and clear for every one.

An example of stupidity, in Tunisia, if for some new technology or industry or product, there is no law that regulates its trade or use, it is automatically considered as illegal, which is the opposite of what the law says, because nothing can be prohibited or banned without a law. That's why, some people owning crypto currency where arrested, and the crime is possessing crypto currency that can be used in illegal activity and cyber crimes!

Peleset (Philistines) were a group of sea peoples from Greece or Cyprus who were frequently at war with the Lower Kingdom of Egypt and settled Gaza. 

I can find very little information on the origins of Palashtu to speak on, so I’ll just leave that one. 

Again, having different regional governments in individual territories is very typical of empire. And kingdoms within an empire fighting each other was very common in the Middle Ages, i.e. the Holy Roman Empire. Neither of these make a state independent. If one doesn’t have a country, then having the equivalent of a national guard is a regional battalion. Whether that offends your masculinity or not is of no consequence.

Again, Israel is the follow up state to the only independent state that existed before a long period of empire under the British, Romans, Sassanids, Ottomans, Crusaders, the Ummayads, and more. 
I’d love to learn about the other independent regional states you seem to think existed there. As some say, put up or shut up. If you have info and resources I don’t, feel free to share it.

Personally, I’m firmly in the two state solution camp. Because the timespan of a state and people does not determine that existence or legitimacy of that state. That is true for both Israel and Palestine.

Beyond that, I have serious reservations about resources like IllustrativeDNA claiming to track ancient DNA populations when other DNA analysis companies openly admit that they can only reliably estimate origins in relation to modern populations within the last three hundred years or so. Anything beyond that is probably pop-science rather than quantifiable science. That’s a standard that I’m applying to everyone, not just Jews and Palestinians.

The deep rooted cultural history is more complicated. Modern Palestinians do not have archaeology, linguistics, or cultural practices that are exhibited by indigenous levantine populations. I’d be happy to be proven wrong, if you have examples. My understanding is that most practices are imported from Arabia, Syria, and Turkey, culinarily, linguistically, religiously, and even in regards to fashion. 

Jews, Old Yishuv (those who stayed) and those who were/are in the diaspora, have always identified as one people with common origins and have always maintained ties with each other. The difference between the Muslim Ummah and the Jewish community is that we see ourselves as being ethnically brothers with a common history and ancestors as opposed to a unified religious group.

The idea that Jews, pre-political Zionism or not, lived in harmony pre-1947/1948 is a contemporary politicized fallacy.

Thanks.

I've got it now: TND may not be exported in any amount (as with Soviet roubles back in the day), and foreign currency may be exported up to a value equivalent to 6000 TND. 

Presumably the Tunisian citizen must show paperwork to Tunisian customs on departure to prove that they bought the foreign currency (GBP) legitimately in a bank or bureau?

(This is not someone who has been outside of Tunisia before or imported foreign currency. They will buy the GBP with TND inside Tunisia.)",2024-01-12 09:39:36

The undeniable fact is that genetic analysis of Palestinians shows deep-rooted history and very close genetic ties to their levantine ancestors. 

While it’s true that the jews that were indigenous to Canaanite still exist in Palestine today, it is fallacious to pretend that Israel’s claim to Judea is based on this small minority. 

As stated earlier, 45% of Israelis are from European descent, and these were the occupying jews that came as refugees in 1947. The indigenous jews were living in harmony with muslims and christians before then so using them as your argument in support of Israel’s claim to their “homeland” is either misguided or insincere",2024-01-12 08:23:26

* **To be respectful of the culture:** 
It's advisable to dress modestly, but that usually applies in more traditional and conservative areas.



* **Engaging with the queer community:**
This may require discretion, as attitudes can vary. While there might not be specific venues openly catering to the queer community, exploring more liberal and urban areas in Tunis could increase the chances of meeting them. Approach these interactions with respect for privacy, as not everyone may feel comfortable openly discussing their sexual orientation.




* **Rich Culinary scene:**


1. The local cuisine: here are some of our best and popular streetfood which are cheap and mouthwatering: kafteji, ojja merguez (merguez is traditional Tunisian suasages), lablebi (very good for cold weathers), brik, fricassé, chapati (while the Indian chapati is a roti/bread, this one is like whole sandwich with round and thicker and fluffier bread), mlewi, mtabga, sehan tounsi, etc. You can find this pretty much anywhere especially in downtown Tunis.

You can go to fancier restaurants which can be more expensive but the setting is very beautiful. They offer a variety of traditional food like couscous, soups, stews, salads, tajines, and we also have a wide variety of pasta dishes (Tunisians are fond of it and the second-largest consumers of pasta globally, following Italy) etc. I suggest going to the Medina (downtown Tunis) to restaurants like Al Ali, Dar el Jeld etc. Try places in Sidi Bou Said, La Goulette, or Soukra.

Tunisian cuisine has a nice blend of Mediterranean European influence (France and Italy), North African Amazigh cuisine and a bit of Levant and Turkish influence. Beware that our food is usually spicy, and we consume lots of tuna, eggs and seafood.

2. Sweets: you're in for a treat! We have amazing pastry influenced by the Europeans in most pastries. You can find croissants , mille-feuilles, pains au chocolat, bûches, éclairs, Paris-Brest, Galette des rois, macarons, schneks, and different types of puff pastry. I suggest Eric Kayser, Madeleine & Proust, Le Gourmet, Gourmandise, Pavlova. You can use Google Maps to find nice pastry shops especially around La Marsa, Jardins de Carthage, they're the best.

Tunisian traditional sweets are something else and definitely a must-try. We have maqroudh, kaak, baklava, yoo-yoo, different puddings etc. You can get these in El Medina of Tunis but also in some popular pastry shops like Madame Masmoudi, Gourmandise etc. Btw we have Mkhareq (Tunisian version of the Indian Gulab Jamun but we do them in the shape of a donut), Jalabi too which are called Zlabia here. Both are best bought from Beja (North West of the country).



* **Historical sites:** here is [a list of some archaeological sites](https://www.tunisiepatrimoine.tn/en/sites/) and these are a few less-known ones in the North West of the country [here](https://wildyness.com/news/archaeological-sites-unknown-tunisia). My favourites are Carthage, Bulla Regia and El Jem. You definitely have to visit el Jem amphitheatre! Not only is it [one of the best preserved Roman stone ruins in the world, it is also one of the biggest amphitheatres in the world](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphitheatre_of_El_Jem). Many scenes of the Oscar winning movie The Gladiator were filmed there. Speaking of movies, Tunisia is also where several scenes from the origin Star Wars trilogy were filmed. Fun fact, the name Tatooine comes from the name Tataouine which is a region in the South of Tunisia. The set is still there and people go visit it to take photos.


It is important to note that the experience in Tunisia is different than in other archaeological sites in Europe for example because the place won't be crowded with tourists and you have access to the whole place to free roam without barriers which offers a lot more intimate and special visit.

Next to most archaeological sites, you find a dedicated museum in which they store artifacts excavated from there. However, I think you definitely have to visit the Bardo National museum (Tunis) which has a nice collection of interesting artifacts. Even though we are a relatively small country, our history and culture have been influenced by the Amazigh, the Numidian, the Punic/Carthaginian, Romans, Arabs, Ottoman Turcs, the Moors, the French, the Italians, the Jews. You can see it in our food, architecture, traditional clothes, historical sites etc in varying degrees in different places. I am sure there are other places which I failed to mention in the south of the country for example.


* **For cultural events and the art scene:** you can seek information on the internet like [here](https://www.haya-mag.com/date/et-apres) or look for them through Facebook. There are nice art galleries in Sidi Bousaid, la Medina de Tunis, look for what they have next in the program in Theatre Municipal (Downtown Tunis), some restaurants and bars offer special events for music, poetry reading, dancing etc, so make sure to check that. Some hotels also do expositions and cultural events.



Tunisian hospitality is notable, so engaging with people openly and respectfully can lead to meaningful connections and rich exchanges. Please feel free to contact me if you have a specific question or need further assistance. I hope you enjoy it here!",2024-01-12 06:02:57

Disons que même en France ces profils restent rares, relativement . Mais il est vrai qu'il y a une certaine polarisation des idées qui se fait en occident, avec une jeunesse de l'immigration un peu nihiliste qui ne croit plus vraiment aux valeurs occidentales telles qu'elles nous ont été prônées (""liberté"" mais au final certaines vérités ne sont pas bonnes à dire, ou alors les politiques qui font leurs choux gras sur l'islam depuis 40 ans). Certains ont donc cherché d'autres codes et à retourner aux sources, si j'ose dire, un peu par opposition à ce discours libéral à l'excès. D'autres se sont même dit ""pourquoi pas la Tunisie ?"" pour peut-être s'établir quelque part plus en accord avec leurs valeurs, en se rendant compte finalement que ce n'était pas si différent de l'occident sur certains points (à prendre avec des pincettes, imo je trouve que ça reste toujours plus simple d'être musulman pratiquant en Tunisie que dans n'importe quel pays occidental). 

> Bon il y a aussi le profils de l'inverse, ceux qui vont refuser tout contacts avec les natifs car étant barbares, blédards, et étant racistes envers les natifs, voyant le négatif partout dans leur démarche et étant très condescants sur leur manière d'être par exemple "" Ah bon tu utilises de l'eau pour te nettoyer"" ou "" Ah les femmes ont pas de libertés chez les arabes( c'est faux, ici en Tunisie du moins)"". Mais bon ces profils sont moins courant car ils ne rentrent pas en Tunisie pour les vacances 

Alors crois-le ou pas, on est pas mal à avoir installé des mini douchettes près des toilettes ici ! Quant à la liberté des femmes, c'est vrai que la Tunisie n'est pas ce qui se fait de pire, loin de là ! Mais je suppose que c'est quand même assez relatif par rapport aux réalités de chacun : l'expérience est différente selon qu'on habite dans une grande ville ou une petite ville rurale, qu'on soit d'un milieu aisé ou alors d'un milieu plutôt modeste.

>Bon l'image du village elle est trompeuse. La majorité des gens habitent aujourd'hui en ville ou dans les périphéries de celles-ci, et même si les conditions sont atroces, on est pas sur de la misère. Il y a beaucoup de gens qui font simplement de l'extorsion sur leur famille à l'étranger sous la menace de couper les liens familiaux et de salir le nom de la dite famille au pays. Il faut être honnête ça existe et c'est de la merde. Ils ont largement de quoi vivre mais font ça dans l'espoir de flamber avec des objets issu de l'étranger .  
>  
>Après il y en a qui immigre illégalement et s'attende à ce que leur famille leur donne refuge. C'est risqué parce que s'ils se font attraper c'est une amende de 25.000 euros pour la famille qui héberge.  
>  
>Bon on peut quand-même apporter de la nuance. Il y a aussi des gens qui vivent en france, qui promettent à tout va ""ouais une fois que t'es en france tkt je t'arrange le tout juste viens"" et qui les lâchent au bout de trois jours.

Le principal problème, comme je disais, c'est le manque de compréhension des réalités économiques de l'autre. Certaines personnes au pays pensent qu'on roule sur l'or en Europe. Alors certes, soyons honnête, on a un pouvoir d'achat supérieur au Tunisien local moyen. Ceci dit ce n'est pas forcément tout rose, d'autant que pas mal de franco-tunisiens en France composent la classe modeste/ouvrière (cela change, avec de plus en plus d'enfants d'immigrés qui réussissent), avec nos parents qui faisaient des métiers pas qualifiés (ouvriers, gardiens, ménage...) et habitant souvent dans des conditions pas folles non plus (logements relativement petits). Donc accueillir quelqu'un est parfois difficile, voire carrément impossible. Pour te donner une idée, j'ai grandi à 3 dans la même chambre jusqu'à mes 20 ans à peu près. J'ai pas été traumatisé, j'en garde un super souvenir, mais on vivait déjà les uns sur les autres quoi. Dans la maison du bled, bah oui elle est si grande qu'accueillir une personne de plus ou de moins ne change rien. Le mieux encore est de ne pas faire de promesses qu'on ne peut pas tenir, c'est sûr, si je dis à quelqu'un de venir j'assume. Et à titre perso, si j'ai vraiment quelqu'un de ma famille proche qui est là et qui n'a nulle part où dormir, bien sûr qu'il vient chez moi même si c'est pas grand. Malgré note hoka tone qui nous servait de maison, je peux te dire qu'on en a acceuilli des gens haha

Et tu fais bien de parler des sanctions, c'est aussi délicat d'aider quelqu'un en situation irrégulière. Dieu merci je n'ai pas été confronté à ce soucis directement, mais j'en connais qui l'ont été.",2024-01-14 00:11:01

You can come in with very crappy ideas, if you market them as ""French/Turkish/any country"" that'll work. Fi tounes el 3asma, people mout ala Kayser even though that has nothing especially incredible (and expensive, to add something !).

That may be due to some lack of self esteem, indeed. Imo I always found that's a waste that some Tunsian think that salvation will come by negation of their identity, traditions, that everybody is soooo better outside anyway. Not saying inspiration is bad, Tunisia was influenced by a lot of civilizations, but you'll never see a Russian or a Japanese thinking they should forget their traditions. It is not by denying ourselves that we gain respect from others.

&#x200B;

> How you guys see locals ? 

Nice question haha Some people born in France have a negative view about locals. Sometimes based on bad experiences, family issues... Things like that. Imo Tunisia is like every place in the world : good and shitty people, don't be too nice but treat others with respect as well. Sure, if you come from France and act like a stupid brat, people will mostly dislike you. Imo I find  Tunisian locals are nice when you show them interest, when you try to talk to them in their langage (sometimes they'll be suprised at first and make fun of your accent, yes haha). I know a lot of educated ones, but also others with more rural lives and both often have nice conversations, they love talking about politics lmao. And my parents were locals anyway so I always find talking to locals a bit ""comforting"", I don't know why 😄

Life is quite hard in Tunisia, even for people coming from Western Europe that's not as cheap as before.  And i'm not even talking about healhcare, if really you wanna have access to some decent service, you'll have to pay for it. So 280€ sounds very very low.

Then, regarding religion, a lot of Tunisians are very liberal. Sure Tunisia is still more muslim than your average western country (people grew up with muslim traditions, you hear the azan, that someones prays is a very basic thing...), so if you just wanna find a country where you can be ""invisible"" as a practicing muslim, Tunisia is fine.

First of all you should be aware that trans/queer identities in Tunisia are criminalised. Although the law is mainly applied to cis gay men, it is still a somewhat police state where the text doesn’t matter much if they really want to fuck someone up. 
That being said, it really depends. 
If your photo and gender on your passport/id are conforming to your appearance and gender presentation, you won’t face much issues. 
Other than that, as long as there’s no “sign” that you’re trans, the average person won’t look twice and you won’t be bothered. There are some spots in the country (clubs, areas, cafes, spaces) where its heavily queer so you’d be safest there. However, nothing is guaranteed. 
Many of the trans people I know who came to Tunisia usually end up enjoying their time and leaving safely. 
The country is not a queer friendly place at all, but there are many ways for it to be safe if you do enough research and know the right people. I’m sorry it’s not better news but I hope this helps!

Edit: your citizenship matters here too! If you hold a white/western passport you’ll face significantly less issues from the police, and less issues from people if you’re white.",2024-01-13 21:13:49

Bear in mind also that in every country where buses/trains/metros are seggregated, it's for few of them and not all. So basically, governemnts there are offering the option to women who want to use them without impacting the others.

And apart from the secual harassment part, it's been noticed in Japan that women and kids have a problem boarding trains during rush hours as people tend to push and shove to make way for themselves. Needless to say, women and kids can't do that easily an end up stranded for a long time until they can board.

And finally, there is the religious aspect. A lot of conservative women would be more comfortable in a female-only vehicle and have no interest in interacting with strangers, let alone be subject to some creepy actions.

See, all positives here. Nothing negative or nothing that warrants banning gender-seggregated transportation means.

Any source? Gender-segregated carriages in Japan, Malayisa and other places are actually a sucess. It also doesn't make sense that gender-segregated transport increases sexual harassment cases. Are you saying Egyptian women started groping each other?

> as it will make male-female interactions awkward or rather odd 

That's a weird claim. A train/bus is not supposed to be a cafe. If anything, it's good behaviour to be quiet and read a book or a newspaper on a train/bus. Assuming it is true, why is that even an issue? I mean protecting woemn is way more important than foestering mixed gender debates on the way back home.

> It would blow back in emergency situations, such as a man who would not be able to go with his wife, mother, sister, all of whom might be sick. 

They can organize themselves somehow, by using another transport means, or going to the mixed buses if they are available. In any case, these are hypothetical scenarios.

> We would rather punish any outlaws heavily, as it is even economically more viable, instead of having to double or already near dead public transportation 

You're not doubling anything. If it's 100 mixed buses, you can split them 50/50 or 60/40 or any other ratio based on the demand from each gender.

Also, the whole argument about enforcng the laws, making police do their job properly, or add more cameras has nothing to do with the seggregated transport thing. You can do both, and having gender-seggregated buses is not going to lead to less cameras or less efficient police.

> Then, and only then, when we punish enough people (preferably with fines better than jail), people will actually adapt to the law and follow it, not because they're scared of anymore like in the beginning, but because it's now internalized and would become the new norm. 

Again, not only you can do both, but seggregating buses/trains will help you acheieve that way quicker and cheaper. Overnight, you'll see groping and harassment crimes within transport means drop by a massive percentage.",2024-01-13 19:39:58

Now, even without gender based segregation, in certain highschools, especially in areas with a very low population, students sometimes have to pick a section they have no interest in Pursuing because there’s simply not enough students to make up a class. 

The same thing goes for Les options school couldn’t justify hiring a teacher for an optional subject that not enough students chose. 

Imagine this now with gender based segregation: how many girl schools would offer techniques? How many boy schools would offer lettres? 

How many students will have to suffer choosing something they didn’t want to study and get told it was your choice, you did this to yourself *all because you couldn’t keep it in your pants*

Because gender segregation will not lower the cases it would actually raise them (check out Egypt), as it will make male-female interactions awkward or rather odd.

It would blow back in emergency situations, such as a man who would not be able to go with his wife, mother, sister, all of whom might be sick.

We would rather punish any outlaws heavily, as it is even economically more viable, instead of having to double or already near dead public transportation, putting some cameras and having the police actually do their job would be not only more preferable but also more effective, as if we keep punishing these ""jbours"" that are causing the problem the rates will drop in a period of time. 


Then, and only then, when we punish enough people (preferably with fines better than jail), people will actually adapt to the law and follow it, not because they're scared of anymore like in the beginning, but because it's now internalized and would become the new norm.


As I always say, we do have good laws, but sadly these laws aren't enforced by the police, which makes them useless and forgotten, but always not impermeable.",2024-01-13 18:59:50

khp15df,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/19217e9/a_professor_in_tbs_sued_a_student_over_a_deleted/khp15df/,1,"Gaza wasnt under occupation since 2005. Even then its arguable it ever was by Israel. Why I say that is because Egypt started several wars with Israel after annexing Gaza from its puppet state government of Gaza Protectorate following 1948. So of anyone occupied it. It was Egypt between 1952-1963 when it just abolished the Protectorates government unilaterally which it had forced to administer the place from a distance from 1949 till 1952.

The people didnt complain about occupation by Egypt & even became Egyptian citizens agter 1952. There was no talk of ""Palestinians"" by people in Gaza. In 1973 the final major war between Egypt & Israel occured. Egypt along with Syria & others launched invasions & failed so spectacularly that Israel had to be asked nicely by USA not to finish completely conquering Syria & Egypt in their counter attack. Egypt & Syria were completely militarily defeated & entirely humiliated. Why did Egypt attack Israel in 1973? Because it attacked in 1967 & lost then too. That time loozing Gaza & Sinai up to the Suez canal. 

In 1979 a formal peace treaty was signed between Egypt & Israel. Isreal agreed to hand Sinai back & offered Gaza too. Egypt literally rejected Gaza. More accurately they rejected 3/4 of what was the Gaza Protectorate. 1/4 is quietly kept & now assumed as just Egypt today. But this is due to the fact thr people in that 1/4 dont identify as ""Palestinian"" & the Egyptian settlers discarded by Egypt in 1979 needed a new story to justify not just getting along with Jews like the 2 million arab israelis have since 1947 or returning to Egypt. Today the most common surname in Gaza is ""Maşri"". Fathi Hamad, a senior Hamas official even went on Egyptian TV in 2014 & tried shaming Egyptians for not helping Gazans on the basis that Palestinians(in Gaza) were all their Egyptian & Saudi brothers. So really. Was it occupied if the people believed they were Egyptian, they knew they were settlers, believed Egypt was their country &  Egypt lost the area in wars it started & when offered the territory back rejected soverignty over it?

Worse still Egypt stipped those people in the Israeli controlled paet of Gaza of citizenship. But even then Israeli too abandoned its then uncontested soverignty of Gaza in 2005 & left. Completely left. They bribed 70,000 Israeli residents to leave & the remaining 30,000 were forcably evicted by IDF in 2005. They left all that farm equipment & farming infrastructure to Gazans. What did they do? Hamas burned & destroyed it all & got elected in Gaza. Hamas then took that technical win as licence to essentially succeed from ""Palestinianism"" & become basically Gaza the Hamas terrorist base to continually attack israel from. 


As for West Bank. That is more complicated. In 1947, the Arab part of the Palestine Mandate which had become independent in 1946 as Jordan invaded  it conquered a region of the reciently abandoned remaining portion of the British mandate then called Palestine(confusing I know, the british were sloppy at naming things). That conqueres region it kept after 1948 truce it then ethnically cleansed of all jews & minorities & renamed West Bank in reflection of Jordan which was colloqually known as east bank. There was no talk of ""Palestine"" or ""palestinians"". Jordan moved in settlers & settled displaced arabs it had ordered to retreat from the areas now known as Israel after it started loosing & need to consolidate some of what it had invaded. 

These Jordanian settlers & local as well as displaced arabs held the Jericho Conference where they proclaimed themselves subjects of Jordan & the King of Jordan accepted this rigged proclimation. Feeling greedy Jordan tried going to war with Israel again in 1963 & lost. Lost badly & traded soverignty of West Bank in all but name to Israel for return of territory captured by Israel from the original Jordan. In 1970 Egyptian terrorist group called PLO/Fatah who were operating after 1968 in Jordan as a base to launch attacks on Israel tried to overthrow the Jordanian government. They failed & were expelled to Lebenon. Then because West bank was a hotbed of anti monarchist, jihadi & communists. Jordan stipped them all of citizenship & completely abandoned claims of soverignty on West Bank. Thus after that calling it an occupation became absurd. 

Jordans politics is complex but basically 70% of the population are ""Palestinian"" today. But in the context of Jordan that term really just means the refugees of the breakup of the Ottoman empire who were displaced from Lebenon, Egypt, Syria & Turkey who settled in what was the British palestine mandate(including jordan) between 1921-1947. 

The west banks situation was settled in 1994 when the PLO who were the defacto leadership of the arab rebels within that region made a treaty with Israel. Today they use the weird & unusual consitutional settlement they freely agreed to but now resent as an excuse to pretend they are occupied but the reality is they made a shit deal they didnt need to agree with because they have buyers remorse & refuse to admit to their own failings & political infighting along with allowing the blight of Hamas & internal corruptiob to overtake any national ambitions & lead to the worst outcome instead of the framework of a 2 state solution which the 1994 Oslo II accords were supposed to be. 

Ultimately WB is split into 3 Zones, A & B are fully controlled by PLO, defacto full soverignty. Zone C which was agreed to leaves Israel with military control of & its in this region that Israeli raids on Jihadi terrorists & strikes on Hamas occur. This however is depicted as ""occupation"" because most onlookers dont understand Israel military soverignty was acknowledged by the Palestinian gov. in 1994. Lots are terrorist sympathizers today in WB so are naturally annoyed that Israel exercised its legally agreed soverignty to persue terrorists in those areas. Zone C is under palestinian civil authority. So while IDF can operate there freely, its policing & civic functions are palestinian. In zone B & A full anti Jew aphartied is practiced by Palestinians with no jew or israeli allowed & have been lynched without consequence in the past for entering. These are fully controlled by PLO 70,000 strong military & civic authorities & IDF doesnt enter. 

This is the weird complicated realities of the place.",2024-01-13 17:52:19

If you are white though you'll be generally fine, a tourist is a tourist but you'll have to identify as the gender of your passport in the airport and bring with you a doctor's note if you are taking any hormones or medication.

I suppose if your passport says female and you look like a cis man you’d have problems at the airport. (Who’s passport is this, it says female and you’re male, what’s transgender?, cops will come, the whole 9yards) 

On the other hand if you don’t look … very masculine and could still pass as a woman, then I suppose you wouldn’t have problems at the airport but socially people will consider you female, you’d have to use women’s bathroom etc … 

Maybe depending on how you dress and if you keep telling people you’re a man you’d get called slurs or something,

Long story short this is the best case scenario, worst case is probably you going to a conservative area and pissing off random “clochard” simply by existing within his peripheral vision who then decides you have too many unbroken bones and he needs to change that.

Throughout the year my grades were average tbh in the main subjects because l profs deliberately gave us hard exams pushing us to make more efforts.
Secondary subjects, throughout the year were no worry for me especially with languages (easy A)

In the national exams there was the plot twist XD.
The best marks I got were fil main subjects, math sc phy info, ama I was shocked kif rit notet fr, arabic, philo, marks mebin 10 w 13 while easy A 19 20 fil wost l3am.

How to work on the secondary subjects:

I bargained with philosphy, from 7 chapters I revised only 1, fil national exam ya3tiwk 2 chapters w enti takhtar.. luckily the chapter I picked jebou 3lih.

Fil French, it grammar was basic (causalité, conséquences), conjugaison kifkif ama lezmek ta3ref hajet kima futur, futur antérieur, parfait, pq parfait, subjonctif, et surtout wa9tech testa3mel kol we7ed.. There'll be one grammar ex and one conjg.
7adher el essai bel behi, marra fil jem3a 7ot essay a9rah, 7awel you make bullet points before you write.. traina ekteb afkar w ba3d ebda ekteb el essai. Keep in mind the structure of the essay too.

3arbi w german w english mchit n3adi fihom with willpower xD.

Focus on the main subjects, don't drain your brain with a lot of excercises, diversify the excercies for a chapter and then move to the next. 2-3 hours enti w subject daily ken t3ebt wala ma 3inekech it s okay erte7 nhar nharin. Mouch lezem ta9ra ba3d l études, ken ta9ra études ba3d wa9t lycée w trawa7 makher juste or9od liletha (I hope ma ta9rach kol lila etudes though, lezem you practise on your own.)

A very important note: fil ktob mta3 l cours there are really good materials, sc w ph w math literally you can learn on your own.. eng w french too fihom very good exercies w essays.. so I think besides seriet eli ya3tiwhom les profs w ex hethom w exams bac 9dom that's enough material.

Working smart is the optimal form of working hard.

Let me make it clearer: to import goods you will need foreign currency EUR, USD etc.

If you don’t have enough of those, you will have to import less goods while you figure out how to generate new income in those foreign currencies.

To bridge for your most essential imports you will need credits. The problem when everyone knows you are (nearly) bankrupt, is that their interest rates will be very high. That is if they accept to lend you money at all.

There comes the next problem. Debt is not inherently bad. Most investments are impossible without debt. Debt overburden is however definitely bad. When you have to dedicate all of your money to pay the interests of your debt and then need to start borrowing money just to pay the interests and then need to sell off all of your assets to pay the interest, you are screwed.",2024-01-13 12:32:30

He arrested potato farmers early in 2022 for storing potatoes to sell out of season as if it's a crime even though it's part of their business model so it became unprofitable and we started importing potatoes because Tunisian potatoes stopped being produced. This year many farmers chose to not plant wheat because they've been harassed by the government.

Do you have good sources for these like the ones from the posts you made? Thanks for the posts btw I really like their presentation, very simple and to the point

So the damage that's done is actually insanely huge and worse than just dumb loans at high interest rates if production in all of those industries is dead no? Like we legit never had it this bad in the country ever

> There has never been an IMF sponsored plan that argues that you should cause shortages in basic necessities like food and medicine for your own people, not to mention that it doesn't even include selling all state companies which people love to harp on.

This part I disagree with, one of the main points of IMF reforms is always to reduce state expenditure and especially the salary ones, that's what leads to privatisation, as well as ""monetary policy"" to reduce imports (ie make the dinar weaker) which will impact imports of medicine/food

khnkcf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1955zrf/kais_saied_lied_to_you_about_coffee_shortages_and/khnkcf6/,1,"Okay so this is an extremely long comment and I surely won't be able to address it all in a comprehensive manner. But I'll still say a bit... And please, do not take me for someone who thinks KS is all the hype. It feels like a subtext throughout your writing, and it's really not the case.

First of all, yes, a lot of regular people believe the lies. I'm not opposing what you're saying on that at all, simply adding my belief that you're right that these are lies reflecting that the state cannot afford, as well as adding that other people active in the field of economics all know this to be true. 

Second, yes I agree, he's doing it in a covert way and it's problematic from a democratic perspective (not that that would be taken much into consideration...). I also agree with you that he is generally incompetent, but he is also an ideologue who seems to care about notions of sovereignty which, for the economy, are quite important. 

Third, he has definitely *not* gotten Tunisia out of any debt spiral, because the debt spiral cannot be resolved with his conservative approach in such a short time. But he has slowly started digging into it. That's also why I'm arguing that this is simply going too slowly, and there are so many externalities that make such a plan (if it is in fact a plan) shaky at best in the long term.

Fourth, there are 'radical moves' and there are 'radical moves'. Flip-flopping on a migration deal may have caused some headaches in the EU and fit his populist narrative in domestic politics, but radical moves that would have serious consequences are nowhere to be seen. - Think for instance nationalization of industries run by foreign capital, or partaking in some of the slowly forming alliances of countries that organize and refuse to pay debt. Those would cause serious diplomatic rifts and not the current sillyness.

Fifth, re: opportunist candidates, I think you're missing my point - given that you basically said it yourself. Tunisians have in the past been voting for people who promise things they can't give. It's no different.

It seems to me (and I have some experience with this field) that KS is a lone but staunch opponent within his own administration of IMF dealings, and that agreements during his administration have only been made on a staff-level after which they've been rejected politically. I don't want to make too much of a judgment on KS' mental capability, as I think it's a bit immature to include such arguments in political analysis, but it does look like from the outside that he has followed a learning curve on debt/finance politics and has gradually become more skeptical of the IMF over his tenure, which may explain some of the inconsistency.

As for the 'severity of austerity policies', there are two aspects to it and you are missing the second. The first, which you rightly pinpoint, is how hard it hits the population in the short-term. But in the context of the 'fabric of the economy', the second - how it reshapes the economy in the long-term - is more important.

After taking extensive loan packages several times since 2014, the IMF's macroeconomic requirements have led Tunisia to shrinking its economy and removing all fiscal space to make public sector investments in the long-term. This causes public services to fail, and it paves the way for neoliberal arguments that favor privatization of everything, which in turn makes services inaccessible to the poor. The loans put Tunisia into a debt trap in which, at the moment, Tunisia spends about a quarter of its annual budget on servicing debt, which is equivalent to the new debt it takes on - and, like most countries, Tunisia of course has a law that requires it to pay debt servicing, which makes it a first priority in the budget, leading to cuts everywhere else when things run tight.

So austerity measures usually are put in place in order to be able to service debt. This has no effect on the debt spiral, which is the primary cause of this predicament in the first place. What we're seeing now in Tunisia is specifically cutting of imports, which is not in order to service debt but to pay it off and get out of the debt spiral (put in very simplified terms). It does not simply service debt but go further than that and, if successful in the (very) long-term will lead to Tunisia's debt levels going down, its credit ratings going up, its foreign currency reserves to restock and to a larger degree of economic sovereignty, allowing more room for investments in the public sector (which is broadly and strongly opposed by the IMF and its creditors).

Again, all of this is theoretical, and I have no doubt that KS and his insular team will fudge it up over time. Also, bear in mind that various commissions working to implement WB-mandated cuts in different public sector areas are continuing their work with out much change...

Sixth (and last), just wanted to note for your bread example: there may obviously be flaws in this plan - specifically, I doubt (but don't know enough about it to say for sure) that Tunisia's durum production is large enough to sustainably support it at the moment.

However, the idea is a good one. More expensive bread that requires no import can be preferable to cheaper bread that does. The former relies on the internal economy and local currency, whereas the latter relies on loans and all the conditionalities that come with it - and also, if you want to calculate the real price, costs interest rates on top, as well as ruinous macro-economic policy conditionalities. 

For Tunisia to once again seek a higher degree of food sovereignty by producing its own staples, if successful, will leave the country much less dependent on Europe and the US, and therefore will leave those actors with much less political leverage. It would make bread a product similar to many of the vegetables in the markets that see no shortages atm because they are just produced domestically and immune to shocks related to Tunisia's engagement with other countries.",2024-01-13 11:13:21

Do you know why it boomed? Do you know what kind of measures were put in place? 

They certainly didn't take on more local debt to fund failed state companies while secretly causing shortages like Kais Saied is doing. They instead defunded/sold failed state companies and encouraged private companies.

It's actually a bit ironic you mention that period because we got out of it by taking an IMF loan and having actual reforms that Ben Ali did, it wasn't by doubling down on fixing prices of milk at a loss for producers and causing the dairy industry we built for 40 years to be destroyed for the sake of populism. 

Instead there was actual incentives for local production, not chasing them down and arresting people for a show just because they're freezing some potatoes to sell out of season. 

>We had only local products and whatever was imported relied mostly on bilateral trade with other third world countries, avoiding the need for hard currency.  

Kais Saied is killing local production and replacing it by imports except he can't afford it so we neither have local production or imports, it's quite literally the opposite of what the reforms are supposed to be. 

>I have a working hypothesis: this is like a poor family father who can’t afford things so he tells the children that the ghoul came and took them away.

khn531p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1955zrf/kais_saied_lied_to_you_about_coffee_shortages_and/khn531p/,5,">I think anyone in Tunisia who's engaged in any sort of economic work/analysis/fields/circles see this as a completely uncontroversial fact

Except 70-90% of Tunisians believe the propaganda the president constantly spreads.

I didn't have a single doubt that this is what's been done very early on but I'm trying to distill everything into something easily digestible and irrefutable to show that the president is indeed lying. Whether people believe it or not is another question but honestly it can feel like a lonely and mind wracking existence to be surrounded by people absolutely believing these conspiracies.

>What they're trying to achieve, I think, is to slowly wane Tunisia off of the debt spiral its gotten progressively more and more caught into since 2014, but doing so

So this is what actually triggers me on a personal level much more than the average Tunisian saying people are hiding coffee in their basement, it's this idea, from people who do understand what's happening economically, that he's doing it in a covert way to fix the economy.

Believe it or not, I've long given up on Tunisians voting in the right people because the current situation was caused by people voting in people who offer 100 millimes bread (literally.. 3aridha cha3beya if you remember) and constant raises and jobs than actual economic plans. So I found myself actually willing to believe in a benevolent machiavellian leader that may lie about a few things to get the country on a better path.

That is definitely not Kais Saied though and here's why:

* He chose to keep vaccines and further agreements on getting vaccines until after his coup to look like the saviour. That is literally killing people just to get to power and is a very strong statement about his morals.
* He completely refuses any consultation or opinions other than yes-men so he's closer to your typical ignorant Gaddafi-style tyrant than a Singapore/South Korea...etc enlightened/benevolent dictator who will fix the nation
* He has no real economic vision other than a rosy nostalgic picture of the 60-70s he wants to go back to even though those were some of the worst economic times for Tunisia by all metrics. Not to mention that even back then it had some backing and nurturing environment but today your allies are crumbling states like Russia and North Korea.

Now to address your points about what you think Saied is doing, let me preface this with the fact that as much as you think this might be some economic plan, the dude sacked almost all of his ministers that are related to economic planning or finances constantly and many ministerial spots remain unfilled for close to a year intentionally and filled by Kais Saied himself. A guy that literally does not understand the difference between millimes and dinars so before I even talk about his economic performance, let's keep in mind who's actually setting them in motion, it's the guy who said he'd collect 13 billion dinars from business men and confused billion and million on public speeches.

>slowly wane Tunisia off of the debt spiral its gotten progressively more

Kais Saied may have somewhat gotten Tunisia out of a foreign debt spiral accidentally because of his political posturing about sovereignty but he started an even more intense spiral of uncontrolled local dinar dominated debt. Tunisia's debt has risen in 2022 and 2023, both on an amount value and as a GDP ratio. The external (and internal) debt that Tunisia did get had insane interest rates of 10%+, literally consumer credit card levels in the US for a nation.

The internal debt will undoubtably lead to inflation but the kind felt by Tunisians because his policies causing shortages have sent the black market into the stratosphere so real prices are becoming very very different from official stats.

Kais Saied is also causing even more shortages for himself every year by killing local production through his wild goose chases and witch hunts. He killed the dairy industry because he decided last minute on a speech to keep prices constant for populism and ever since dairy farmers have been selling their cattle and production has been dwindling. He arrested potato farmers early in 2022 for storing potatoes to sell out of season as if it's a crime even though it's part of their business model so it became unprofitable and we started importing potatoes because Tunisian potatoes stopped being produced. This year many farmers chose to not plant wheat because they've been harassed by the government.

So his supposed policies to fix the economy are actually giving him even more of a challenge every year because he'll have to import more yet have to pay more in interest to do so. He's effectively killing Tunisian agriculture and this applies to many other sectors like thousands pastry shops that had to close down, olive oil producers having to sell locally instead of importing at higher prices...

Then we're shocked that GDP growth is negative and the actual needs for imports are widening even though the actual imports are shrinking to ""save"" money.

>1: engaging in any sort of radical moves that would shake relations with the EU and US too much

Kais Saied literally goes out of his way to shake relations with the EU/US. It benefits him politically and that's all he cares about.

If he's so wise and cunning that he's keeping this tight balance then explain to me why he'd go on national television and say subsaharians are plotting to replace Tunisians or that the storm in Libya was named by Israelis as some sort of a conspiracy theory? Does that sound like some real politicking to you?

>2: losing power to opportunists who claim they'll be able to sort it all quickly, but whose plan in reality is to just take another IMF loan and continue the starvation of the public sector in the service of the wealthy

Absolutely not true. First of all there's way better candidates than Kais Saied that were rejected by Tunisians and given 0.001% of votes that actually tried to make true economic reforms.

Second, KS's own government themselves applied for an IMF loan and got approved and the plan that was approved by the IMF is not nearly as extreme as what Kais Saied is currently doing. There has never been an IMF sponsored plan that argues that you should cause shortages in basic necessities like food and medicine for your own people, not to mention that it doesn't even include selling all state companies which people love to harp on.

KS is applying some barbaric austerity measures way worse than usual IMF recommended ones, and these measures are dismantling the fabric of the economy. It's not some grandiose plan. It's simply because it's the plan that's populist.

I'll give you an example, they're recently proposing to make bread using durum wheat and saying it's healthier. In reality, that's simply a bad economic choice because durum wheat is more expensive but we locally produce it and the government has a stash and bread shortages are politically sensitive so fuck economic sense let's just have some sort of bread available and blame durum wheat shortages on companies when it happens. That's purely an election/populist move just like many many others that are destroying the economy.

>continue the starvation of the public sector in the service of the wealthy

Kais Saied reduced public investments in many critical sectors like technology and health and water/agriculture by 30-50% while increasing his own budget by 30% in the last 3 years.

That's the benevolent dictator we're talking about. He gives no fucks about public investment. He does anything possible to secure absolute power and every single move he does shows that.",2024-01-13 08:02:44

We had only local products and whatever was imported relied mostly on bilateral trade with other third world countries, avoiding the need for hard currency. Shortages were normal.

Avoid the word « vegetarian » (végétarien, نباتي) when you explaining what you can and cannot have. Instead, say that you cannot eat any fish, tuna, chicken, lamb, beef, etc. Maybe mention that you get sick if you eat these items.

Also ask questions, even if an item looks vegetarian on the menu, it may have tuna or something on it even if it isn’t listed on the menu. 

You could probably have pizza, kafteji, malfouf omlette, pastas, vegetable couscous, etc. maybe brik nature (without tuna), and maybe lablebi.

Here's what the Wikipedia french page says :
 ""La Boga Cidre est de couleur brune, longtemps commercialisée sous cette appellation trompeuse — bien qu'elle n'ait rien à voir avec du cidre — pour la différencier de la Boga blanche. D'une couleur similaire à celle du Coca-Cola, elle a en revanche un goût très particulier qui rappelle la banane, la racinette ou bien le Cola Kampane (boisson franco-antillaise) ; elle tire son goût particulier de l'extrait de caroube qu'elle contient. L'utilisation du mot « cidre » dans son intitulé s'explique par le fait que c'est une copie de la boisson Cidre Meddeb, du groupe Délice-Danone, qui existait en Tunisie longtemps avant son apparition[1].""

I was born in Romania, but my father is Tunisian. I don't speak the Tounsi, but I speak french. Thank God I can communicate with my relatives who live in Tunisia and we can keep in touch despite I don't speak tunisian. So french is an essential language as the tunisian language has many-many loan words from french and for you is easy to speak fluently both arabic and french. In Romania we speak romanian, and both french (or german it depends on the person's choice) english are taught so a well-educated romanian speaks 3 languages in one time. And in Romania it is mandatory to speak english to get the job or to enter in the university. I chose french because of my career and also keeping in touch with my Tunisian relatives. 
Another think: just watch the Tunisia national football team, many players were born in France and speak only french, so they don't speak tunisian. So in my opinion it's better that there are 2 official languages in Tunisia: arabic and french. It makes easier to everyone, but especially for Tunisians born outside of Tunisia.",2024-01-14 17:41:49

Unfortunately, visa free regime was abolished 2 years ago because many people used Serbia as a road to EU.

Open banking laws has entered into effect in Tunisia last year, and Flouci launched the first such implementation with BTE. 


And, no, open banking doesn't mean you'll be able to have easier access to foreign currency, or smoother transfers with the world. It just means banks can now open their computer systems to other companies via APIs and stuff like that.

kht33wp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/19336sn/carthaginians_were_better_at_city_planning_than/kht33wp/,1,">Carthaginians were Carthaginians not Phoenicians.

Carthaginians probably didn't call themselves Carthaginians, They most likely called themselves Kana'ani / Canaanites. Romans used the term Punic to call Carthaginians which means Phoenicians.

Ancient Phoenicians also most likely called themselves Canaanites just like the rest of the other Canaanites, Maybe some of them used the term ""Phoenician"".

So you see, Carthaginians were Phoenicians who settled in North Africa, They weren't restricted to Tunisia, They existed in Libya, Algeria, Spain, Sicily and Malta for example, so they didn't stop at modern day Tunisian borders and say : ""this is our land and what's beyond isn't"".

One more thing, The population of ancient Carthage wasn't entirely Phoenician, They were mixed, There were Greeks (Who also established cities in North Africa like Nabel), Amazigh (Tunis was originally an Amazigh settlement) and others, Phoenicians were probably always a minority but ofcourse a ruling class which is probably why they almost have no genetic trace in Tunisians, I never saw a Tunisian successfully tracing his origin to Phoenicians through DNA test or anything else.

&#x200B;

>And no one has more claims to their history in the modern era than the modern day Tunisians.

I honestly doubt that, Most Lebanese people are probably the direct descendants of Phoenicians, Carthaginians came from Tyre which is in Lebanon. So you could say Lebanese people are Arabized Phoenicians.

Israeli Jews' culture is originally Canaanite and their language, Hebrew, is a Canaanite language which is mutually intelligible to Phoenician/Punic language, You can see that in Wiktionary, Most of the words are most likely written and spoken similarly in both languages. That's why if Hannibal lived today he would probably choose to live among Israeli Jews since he could understand them easily.

Tunisians not only have language and ancestral disconnection with Carthaginians, The culture is mostly not similar so the only strong ""claim"" Tunisians have is geographical claim but Algerians and Libyans equally have that ""claim"".

I will list the sources for my claims in a edit.

""It is unclear what term, if any, the Carthaginians used to refer to themselves. The Phoenician homeland in the Levant was natively known as 𐤐𐤕 (Pūt) and its people as the 𐤐𐤍𐤉𐤌 (Pōnnim). Ancient Egyptian accounts suggest the people from the region identified as Kenaani or Kinaani, equivalent to Canaanite.\[13\] A passage from Augustine has often been interpreted as indicating that the Punic-speakers in North Africa called themselves Chanani (Canaanites),\[14\] but it has recently been argued that this is a misreading.\[15\] Numismatic evidence from Sicily shows that some western Phoenicians made use of the term Phoinix.\[16\]

No it's a bit hard to get irrefutable sources for those sectors and they're a bit more complex than complete import monopolies like coffee and so on.

However, I do know from close sources of dairy farmers (including family) that the government and specifically a minister promised prices would be raised to cover the cost of production because the situation was getting really bad and then the decision went up to the president and he took it as a populist opportunity and declared in a public speech (I believe in monastir that I'll have to dig up) that there will be no increases in milk. This was followed by many dairy farmers selling their cattle and many of them being arrested for selling them to Algeria and then followed by the dairy production slowly but steadily going down and farmers/experts warning repeatedly that Tunisia will go from an excess of production to shortages soon and then it happened and we now have constant shortages of milk. It doesn't help that there's direct subsidies being paid to Delice and so on that went unpaid but that's one small part of the problem.

For potatoes, it suffices to look at the imports quadrupling in 2023 despite the government trying to shut down imports to understand that there was barely any local production. This witch hunt against potato producers was one of the earliest Saied regime populist campaigns back in the day when they started arresting people for e7tikar. I also know from personal sources in agriculture that no one wants to do potatoes anymore since then.

You keep trying to read and over interpret their words when their statements are clear and coherent and do not require much digging to understand. I did not twist his words literally reiterated them the way they were said. He distinctly refered to women going out to work as not normal in the early minutes of the interview. What he talks about afterwards and the bit you are trying to explain about career women is also a point i see as problematic. The fact that only women are supposed to sacrifice their ambitions to build a family is a very backwards idea. The sacrifice is not inherently bad. Parents sacrifice many things for their children as it is with any other responsibility you take on in life. But the fact that these guys as well as many men and women in society think that raising children is a women job is why I personaly believe we have many troubled people in our society. Why must women choose between family and career when men dont have to is a question worth pondering on. You seem awfully concerned with the terminology of misogynist and why we shouldnt call them that. They are grown men, they know what they are saying and they should take responsibility for it. If you say things that are demeaning to women that makes you a misogynist. You want to perceive me as a disingenous person, you are free to do so I dont mind.",2024-01-15 23:36:22

ki0dqhf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/193lsj0/how_do_you_deal_with_doubts_about_religion/ki0dqhf/,2,"I had about 3 years of doubts when I was about 17yo, it was a lot of research and reasoning, and sobhana Allah everything made sense in the end, whenever I questioned smth I got a logical answer that satisfied my needs (btw, I'm not an easy guy to convince) 
As Everything I questioned came with an answer, from the Holy Quran or Hadith, I never question anymore, I just take it as it is, and somehow everything starts making more sense the more you grow older.

So the answer would be, just reach out, ask questions and look for answers, with curiosity and no judgement, be rational and give yourself sometime it's totally fine. I believe in the end everything will make sense inchlh, I am an IT guy and everything to me is logic, And Islam to me always had logical answers.

In a world full of temptation it's easy to choose to give up on Islam therefore I will share two of the arguments that kept me looking for answers and not give up on Islam too soon.

- I was interested in self-improvement, being better with myself, with the people around me, with nature, etc.
For me there was two ways of doing that:
1. In this lively world, with all the self improvement books, videos, people, philosophers...
2. Following gods guidance.
So the two options have the same GOAL but the path is different in a way.
But there's a difference between a GOAL and a RESULT.
The two options have two drastically different results depending on one hypothesis: what if God existed?
If I keep that hypothesis in mind the result of option 1 would be that I may win in this life and reach my goals but the result will be hell because I didn't believe.
But for option 2 I will also  achieve my goals in life, but also the afterlife hopefully.
So the second option was the safest option for me at that moment.

- A lot of things didn't make sense to me in Islam from the look of it. But who am I to judge, what makes sense in this sane world, I live in Germany and I see crazy things in public, you may even see people having sex down a tree. My second argument was that, everything in this universe was created in an amazing order that no human can completely comprehend. The only thing to me that is not in order is human beings, 
But it won't make sense that the one who created this organized universe, to create us without any order, and that's why we got books to follow and we kept receiving these books until we got all we needed from them to create order in this unordered being, but it didn't make us 100% ordered because that's what's special about us, we make mistakes, we do bad and silly things, in short we're being tested.

That made sense to me so it supported my first argument second option. Will I achieve my goals following smth humans created or with the Holy Quran that was sent to us by the Maker of the Universe? And I literally always whenever I encounter smith from the Holy Quran it makes perfect sense to me, it gives me answers, hope, vision, reasons...

So yea I would say don't go too far from it because it will get dark, I live alone in Germany as a 23yo guy and it's really easy to let go of Islam, it may feel good at the start but after that everything starts going down and when one realizes that, it may be too hard to come back.

One last argument that kept fascinating me is that, I always read and listen and learn about new things like self-improvement, self-help, communication, psychology... And somehow I always find things that we've been told to do by the prophet or the Holy Quran about 1400years ago, even tho this book is new or it's a new discovery or just random guy talking about self-improvement on yt. That kept fascinating me till this day.

Those arguments helped me the most with my doubts, I hope they help you in a way also, but no matter what I say or anyone says there's no right answer, you need to find yours, just take what everyone says, analyze it logically and rationally and make your own conclusions. 

We're human beings, we make mistakes, doubts, stupid things, also good and beautiful things. But we have all the power within us to make those choices, so choose carefully, it may not be easy, but if you chose it, it's worth it.

If you have a car go to Géant/Carrefour Marsa, again at 10 am. (Worked for me on multiple weekends)

At lunch break during work if you have a Carrefour nearby check it out too. You don't have to go in just give the counters a quick glance and you'll see whether or not people are carrying Milk/Butter/Flour.

If Israel is an apartheid state, then why is 20% of their population Arab and Muslims ? They become doctors, lawyers, representative, have access to quality education and healthcare, basically a better life than Arabs in Arab countries. How is that apartheid ? 

Hamas and PLO never wanted a Palestinian state, they want the erradication of Israel and the creation of a global Arab and Islamic state. The return of the Caliphate, basically. Why do you think most Arab states support Israel, now, either openly or in secret ? Because a Hamas controlled Palestine would be a disaster for their homeland security.",2024-01-15 18:12:50

ينص الفصل 319 م ج على يعاقب بالسجن مدة خمسة عشر يوما وبخطية قدرها أربعة دنانير وثمانمائة مليم الأشخاص الذين يرتكبون الضرب أو العنف ولا ينجر منه لصحة الغير أدنى تأثير معتبر أو دائم.

2. عقوبة الاعتداء بالعنف الشديد:

ينص الفصل 218 م ج على انه من يتعمد الاعتداء بالعنف الشديد يعاقب بالسجن مدة عام وبخطية قدرها ألف دينار.
والمحاولة موجبة للعقاب.
واعتبرت محكمة التعقيب في القرار الجزائي عدد 730 مؤرخ فى 16/02/1977 أن ” ادانة المتهم من اجل العنف الشديد تثبت بمجرد تصريحات المتضررة اذا تعززت بالكشف الطبي المثبت لمادية الاعتداء وبما لاحظه باحث البداية من وجود آثار العنف بجسم المتضررة”.

3. عقوبة الاعتداء بالعنف المشدد:

All serious candidates (other than maybe Safi Said if you consider that serious) either are in prison, have active cases against them, or were released on bail and basically had to shut up or go back.

Most importantly, even if there was a serious candidate, they will not be allowed to campaign just like how Fadhel Abdelkafi wasn’t allowed to campaign for No: constantly harassed and even threatened to be arrested, attacked, not allowed to use any media/funding…etc at the same time that Kais Saied allowed himself to break all the rules by doing advertisements everywhere including the day of elections, used the Tunisian flag in campaigns even though it wasn’t allowed, broke the electoral silence in the morning of election day and on national television, used the state’s resources from wataneya to dour chabeb to campaign.

People with self love and dignity will chose to say fuck off to abusive partners. It sucks to lack romance in your life, but what happens in an abusive relationship isn't Romance either. The ideal is to have a safe relationship with a partner that respects you and loves you for who you are. If this isn't available, we move to the second best option: celibacy.

>It's not the banks who refuse to finalize the treaty, as they have no say in the matter, but the government, including Kais Saied himself, Tunisair/UGTT and even some reservers from the EU.

The moment Tunisair pays off the almost-carbonized loans from the banks. They will be calling for market liberation and letting foreign airlines in (So they can get the sweet devises in their house of cards vaults).

&#x200B;

> Open banking laws has entered into effect in Tunisia last year, and Flouci launched the first such implementation with BTE.  

Open Rayé3. Although, the white label solution is offered by the central Bank, the banks are still limiting ""their"" wallets  to their rayé3 bizs. 

For example [Amen bank wallet works only in Aziza.](https://www.amenbank.com.tn/fr/0110-amen-bank-etend-lutilisation-damenpay-dans-les-magasins-aziza.html)

In our case it means, between Tunisian accredited banks and financial institutions

The client owns his financial data and able to freely chose his bank: ie portabilité de compte like sim card.

If the bank is not treating you well (usually after you are stuck with rouge and a loan) you can go another bank and if they accept, they take over you account (buy the loan and everything). 

Think of it like Anti ""domiciliation de salaire"" of sorts. 

This will force banks to respect their clients and compete on quality because clients can change banks on demand.

2. I do criticize these religions as well

3. That being said, people should be able to believe whatever they want. That is part of living in a civilised world.

4. You just called me an extremist because I stand against a far-right movement. Your brain does not know of a concept named ""spectrum"". That is assuming you have a brain.

5. You are indeed a boot licker. Far right extremism has done horrendous things for the last century. Want me to remind you?

6. I live in Germany and has been doing so for years. I see how worried a lot of people are here about the AFD. And people like you (i.e., those who justify the behaviour of the AFD and are not Germans) we call them ""boot lickers"" here.

7. You say you don't care yet you are writing multiple comments justifying the AFD. Go see a psychiatrist please.

8. Go watch those hate-filled atheist YouTubers, they sure love targeting populist idiots like you.

9. Being irreligious does not mean being an a**hole. People should practice their religious beliefs, it's a right.

10. I travel a lot and I meet tons of people from different backgrounds, most Muslim friends I met are just, you know, fine people.

11. Seriously go seek help, that much hate is really bad not only for you but most importantly for the people that have to put up with you (that is assuming someone like has any friends to begin with).

12. Why are you in this sub if you justify a party that literally had a serious discussion about stealing your land as if it's their own? Go to r/europe, they love people like you.

You can place your money as a fixed deposit ""dépôts à terme"" and negotiate the rate with the bank. The bigger the amount, the longer the period, the better the interest rate you'll get. It will be always higher than the saving interest rate.

When France came to Tunisia to invade it, there are Tunisian heroes who start making battles against the army of France. The first battles were held in the holy capital of North Africa Al Qayrawen.

Our grandfathers did many victories thank to Ben Amara Jlassi but in the end, a bullshit man from Kalaa Sghira from Sousse betrayed them and told the french army where Ben Amara Jlassi is sleeping so that they can kill him during his sleep and the army gave this man a packet of Biscuit for this. The jerk Soussian thought that they will give him gold!!! If this man didn't betray Ben Amara Jlassi maybe France couldn't invade Tunisia very soon.

Just tell us which part of hardware is useless there according to you?

What you're talking about (the software) is only the digital decoding sub-system and that won't define SDR system as a pure software 😁.

Then (if possible) please put the software's download link you're using so proudly. That would be helpful for ignorant people like me.

It's so much more true than the famous ""Yahoud and Nassara"" that despite serving their interest on times, will still accept you if you have a global vision or contribution to to humanity more generally. The finality for the majority of muslims is just to rule the world, destroy cultures , history, magic of the human spirit and so on. While the other ones, despite the ugly ducklings, still adhere to a paradigm of perpetual techno-progressive drive that want humanity to perennially step up to explore the universe, cure diseases, and so on.

The unselfawareness they have toward hypocrisy is baffling. Like how the fck could someone not see how most of them turned Europe into a dumpster. How beautiful things were and then just atrociously ugly upon their settlement. They lack a philosophical understanding of elegance, of beauty and ugliness. They are fckn r-word to the point where they just can establish the easiest correlation to do with the rise of far right.

Tunisia is already castrated by its mentality. And when analyzing the tendency, Tunisia's far from just stepping up as a regional power. Not only would the population not grow enough, but perpetual and perfectly justified human capital flight will just continuously drain the country from the few wonderkids that can do something. And at the end of the day, **what is the purpose of Tunisia being a power?**

I understood early on that living in a country where the crushing majority of people don't share your vision of life, values and grandiose ambitions, it's just better to transcend your sense of belonging to a country, and make your vision more universal with mankind being entity of brotherhood, and the world your oyster. Cheesy to say but the matter of course just can't assume otherwise.

yes this is interesting, but what highest epitome of virtue? morality has always been a big contradictory field, with absolute disregard to any unpredictablities and unconsciousness of human reality, so yes i think you do end up bargaining, social intelligence about navigating and upholding the rules until one can break them, at his own terms and leisure and while ruffling the least ammount of feathers, in adherence to his own self interest (own value and virtue) in any given moment, so it is a bargaining with yourself on how to present yourseflf ultimately, and that takes self knowledge too, (self knowledge is a fancy way to say, recording and noting ones own likes and dislikes, triggers and points of admirations and the like, without repressing or denying any traits but addding and integrating all into his own sense of self) 

> Unless, of course, making peace within oneself and that's subsequently generated through one's own lenses to life (and what comes with it) and/or transgenerational traumas (depends on what you actualy believe is) which substantially leads to effortlessly distinguishing what's good and wrong. 

am not sure am understanding you here, do elaborate if you can, but it seems you associate peace within with acceptance of personal history and pre established belief in rigth and wrong? in which case, i can say the first makes sense, personal mythology lets call it, which does play a big role in determining taste that is the guide to individuality, but with the second i think its the other way arround, one observes what is happening at any giving moment with a blank stare (ie no preconcieved idea of what is good and evil), andthen based on that observation he can discern within himself what stands out as right and what stands out wrong, while also respectively articulating to himself as to why, consequently giving birth to a value in that moment, which allows for a more flexible state of being,as well as further expands his own consciousness,  this is ofcourse can be as simple and clear or as difficult based not only on context but also on contradiction and opposing values that resist and undermine each other, its in fact rarely a clear cut case, and it takes alot of trust in intuition and instinct and so on, or can send one searching and seeking outside of himself,  so you are right this doesnt necessarily bring peace, and one might have to exist in doubt and uncertainty, which is rarely well handled, it is why people resort to religion or law or pre established systems for guidance on what is right and wrong and good and evil, less headache and most everyone is interested in harmony and peace even if it is an illusory fabrication thats regurguitated and prepetuated over and over and over again, and are satisfied with that much. and down that line you can easily find that someone's self interest and values have been used, as the replacement for one's own, and on a national and international scale,  so it starts to be very clear who is a follower and who is himself. again consciousness against personal and collective unconsciousness.",2024-01-16 17:43:46

Firstly fight or flight are not our only options, those are our primal animalistic options - in cases of extreme stress our frontal lobes shut down and we resort to our animal instincts of fight or flight ( regulated by the animal brain aka amygdala).  Thinking, Reasoning, Planning etc are all regulated by the frontal lobes and are what separate us from animals. 
I also disagree with you that because these discussions are on line there is no need for respect - if there is no respectful debate than there is no debate, there is just unreasonable opinion mongering. Especially online as there is no need to fear for your life, therefore no need to resort to the animal brain. We can stay in the frontal lobes and have civilised, respectful, reasoned and thoughtful discussions where we can, in the anonymity and security of the internet observe, consider and make room for thoughts, ideologies and ideas that we would otherwise feel we should deny out of fear or social pressure. 
It is regretful that people see the internet as a place where we can loose all social decorum, and just spew our unprocessed anger and disillusionment out in the world hidden in the shadows instead of seeing it as a place where the veil of anonymity actually gives us a chance to explore thought and ideas that we can choose to accept or reject after meaningful interaction where we grown and learn as individuals from eachother. All this rudeness and deafness does not lead to understanding, progress nor growth it just sows anger. We could be using our brain to learn, understand and sow respect, especially here where there is not need to fight or flight, no need to be ashamed of colouring outside the lines or to ask the questions we cannot in a room with our peers.",2024-01-16 14:23:54

There is nothing logically speaking that would help this country to exist in the next 50 years. It will collapse. No economy, no culture, no military, nothing really can help this country stand on its own. It has no will.
* either it will become a strong country, at least regionally. Since the country has nothing at all. It means it has nothing to lose. With some luck maybe, the current Elite may collapse, and by more luck, some ambitious new Elite will rise. Tunisia has a lot of potential. For example, we have it all in agriculture.

however, what i dont endorse is the tip towing around others who dont deserve it, and enforcing a soft spokenness in situations where one is being challenged violently, and for no reason, especially online where you dont have to cater to anyone, or maintain any relationship , you can sugar coat your language and lube it up with linguistic niceties all you want, a battle is a battle and its not always fair, and sometimes you trigger one just by existing, and if someone doesn't stand up for himself, it spells to me a very weak will to even live, or a sleazy fighter who always wants to keep a good face in public and then go and gossip behind people's back, which is fine, but unless you are a woman (and even women are confrontational dealers when they know they can get what they want) its not very impressive 

and thats usually someone who cant handle anything negative, or anything at all, and is scared of dealing with others because he might change or grow, but of course even growth is fatal, one personality dies to give way to another, he just prefers to hide behind  a book and manual of conduct as the supreme way of existing with others and blame the rest of the plebians when they dont play nice? I mean what do you expect? and the funny thing is when ""respectful debators by default "" dont get the monotonous harmonious environment that they are looking for, they start to go beg for sympathy, or representation,


 hunting  for some good ole group violence or someone else with the same idea but who is just a little more assertive (violent) Suprise? People are emotional animals and they act on feeling as much as thinking, am not rewriting the way we *should* behave, this is based on already made observations of conduct, and social intelligence is about navigating a space that already exists, because you cannot go against the whole of civilization, you can only live in it with it or create your own and survive while doing it, and sometimes survival isnt worth it when values that you wholly care for, are being tested (but hey looking at your ""nice"" comment, this might be advanced for you)


 , , the strongest person for me  is the one who can both handle his own feelings and other's as well and by handling i mean, dealing with his environment without compromising his own authenticity or by subduing others based on an unnatural rule book, because they are just too wild to handle, instead, by choosing his battles, and opponents and the time and place, and setting the atmosphere for them.. you want peace and harmony? You better be willing to exercise your strength to get it, and you better be willing to be the one to set the atmosphere, and in doing that handle all manners of counterattack, and you better be willing to handle even illogical and absolutely maniacal responses, in what world have we  lived where people devoured each other and then someone came and said ""come on everybody please play nice""  ""why wont they be nice mommy?"" and spmehow everyone said ""yes you know what that just seems more logical"" lmao 

Respectful debates are only existent with mutual respect, and mindfulness of the other, and id say on a higher level of only equal beings, where i know the other person has something of value to add, or say, and i better shut up and listen, because it takes nobility and bravery to speak and nobility and bravery to recognize where One is at fault, and thats a huge sacrifice so it better come naturally based on the content of whats being said then on a default behavioral system, in fact o think such a system is the contributor to even more violence, any animal revolts when being forced to listen to jargon.. eventually always.",2024-01-16 10:04:56

Now the agriculture ministry Özdemir is calling all farmers racist because he is a foreign, what's bullshit, the farmers are angry because the government want to save 900 million Euro in subventions for the agrar Diesel. 
Instead, the agriculture minister want to add a Meat Tax, it was talked about 40cents + plus the original price per meat product.

Imagine a fucked up economy from socialist politicians, and now they want you to pay 1 dinar + for the meat you buy.

How would you react?

The current government tries to dismantle the AFD, while the female leader of the AFD is lesbian and married with a Puerto Rican woman. So absolutely not Nazi or hate against people.
They want to get rid off from people, who use our wealthfare system without even working or doing anything to get integrated.

Last week, there was student groups who wanted take over a school and enforce sharia Law, now the state security is monitoring them as they confirmed in school to deny the freedom of democracy and want women segregation.

That's what we don't want in Germany. Who want the sharia, should go there where the sharia is applied.

Imagine walking into a café fi 7ay cha3bi only to find out that smoking isn't allowed, there's no shisha and that the waiter is a blue-haired chick. People here are simply delusional and financially illiterate

You see, you're careful with your words; as I read, you keep using 'I personally believe,' 'I don't claim,' 'I see.' they just messed up; They poorly worded things and didn't really elaborate what they meant. I get why all the fuss is about,  but in my view, it's not misogynistic at all. I've met real misogynistic folks, and comparing them to these two is inaccurate at all. The term 'misogynist' is a big term; I don't just throw it at people to shut them up and make them bend to my views.  Same goes for terms like 'Nazi,' 'transphobic,' or 'racist' get used just to shut people up. That's what a big amount of people do nowadays, if you didn't notice. They label you with that and create a biases to influence judgments. I mean, look now; some will see me defend these two and jump to calling me misogynistic. Like, what the heck? You don't even know my name. Calling people with any big terms for sharing opinions that don't align with your ideology is just wrong.

Your question 'Why must women choose between family and career when men don't have to?' is not an easy question to answer. It's a tricky one because the reason why women are the primary caretaker is multiple reasons; not just one. One of them is societal, how you got raised, and so on. Another one is occupation;  men often work in dangerous, higher-paying gigs . Plus, when women get pregnant, their salaries don't fare well after a long absence. But if you don't agree that women, at least for three years, should stay with a newborn, I think there is no point elaborating more than that.

I don't see why expecting women to do certain actions and men to do others is problematic at all. Throughout history, men and women focused on different things. Men are work-oriented, and women are family-oriented, and that's what people expect. You might ask, 'Why don't men become family-oriented?' It's their nature, I guess. However, some are not, and here is a real problem when you start shaming people for a choice. If you want a man to take care of kids and you give him money to go to the gym and dress well for you when you come home from work, more power to you. You might ask, 'Why don't they both work?' I see that's not serving the most important individual in the family, which is the child, especially with social media and pornography all over nowadays.

 Saudi Arabia, UAE and Egypt pretend to support Palestine, but they clearly don't want Israel deleted. 

The probable outcome: a coalition composed of several Arab states, Israel and the UN, will take control of Gaza and make sure an organization like Hamas never emerge again. They will then put pressure on Israel to stop the colonization of West Bank. Bibi will lose a lot of steam.

search some photos of gaza before the 7th october attack that place was great they have a better economy than other arab countries and they have a good land to agriculture and they natural resources like gas in their water but isreal control it and made sure nothing good happens there the destroyed their airport and harbor and all the necessary infrastructures like electricity facilities water facilities and made sure of no trad happened
its true hamas is corrupted they didn't have a proper election since 2006 but they don't have the freedom to do anything because isreal control what happens in gaza 
what they can do is build schools mosques homes for their thats it 
if you want to help the Palestinians first stop the killing 
and bring hamas to the table by directly diplomatic meeting with them without a middle guy and remove the blockade on the gaza strip and stop the occupation and the control of gazan people give them freedom with that  hamas will find themselves outmanoeuvred because without occupation and Israeli violence and oppression
hamas won't survive because they want something to resist and Palestinians will know that if Palestinians have freedom in 2 states or one state solution hamas will dissolve their whole purposes is to resist the occupation
without the occupation they will find themselves out of place out of time out of context .
the solution here is the diplomatic approach is to give Palestinians what they want 
and indirectly hamas will lose  
and if isreal want to find peace and survive in the middle east they need to get closer to their neighbours countries and distance themselves from the united States their state is not in America and not in Europe they are in the middle east they need to closer to the middle east by giving Palestine their state us is bad influence since when us do diplomatic talks they bombard countries then ask questions later us doesn't look fo peace in the middle east only middle eastern countries look for peace there what happens there is a proxy wars by the higher powers who are trying to control those countries remove their influence there and you will find peace in the middle east including isreal and Palestine",2024-01-16 01:25:02

This helped me immensely “cope” with the fact that my goal is no longer to excel in class, but to do well fel bac and that’s all that matters.",2024-01-17 20:48:04

Your accusations of self-righteousness lack a solid foundation, perhaps a moment of self-reflection would serve you well. This backward mentality, unable to differentiate between stating facts and engaging in bullying, is a significant hurdle for progress.

My perspective? I've been facing it my whole life but I wear a helmet (metaphorically speaking just in case you think that I actually wear a helmet when I walk around 😂 ), people's opinions don't bother me they are entitled to their own opinion to accept or not accept what I wear and what I don't just like I can give an opinion on what they wear too.

The less views the higher the chance that he will stop posting this kind of content. Reaction content however has always been around since the beginning of youtube.

&#x200B;

> Does that change the fact that they abide by islam/sharia law n they are muslims, ur prophet was once like them. 

Also there's no such a thing as sharia law, it's a word created by the west to create a new scarecrow for people like you to be scared of. There's sharia which is basically what's passed down to the prophet by God and law which is created by humans. Additionally, there's no country in the world that completely follows the sharia.

&#x200B;

> Iran is just another example of how islam ruins, destroys n contradicts democracy, freedom, human rights n civilisations, the islamic republic of iran is a theocracy, ruled by the shia clerics. 

Iran is not even muslim.

&#x200B;

Again, there's no country in the world that follows sharia without any modifications or adding or removing things.

U can't say i'm ignorant just bcz id agree with u, i've read/studied the quran n the hadiths n my family is a muslim family so ik very well what i'm talking about.

> Extremists don't abide by any rule except what benefits them.

So when an extremist say i am allowed to marry a prepubescent girl (n they give their girls to old man) they're trying to apply n abide by ur prophet's rule n a quranic verse, what do u mean by ""except what benefits them"" their role model did that.
when they say that the testimony of a woman is half a man bcz of her mind's deficiency, it's not ""what benefits them"" it is the islamic faith, when they say that never will succeed a nation as makes a woman their ruler it is islam that's why in the most muslim nations ud see a woman as a ruler or even a decision-maker, we can see why the verses of veiling was revealed, i can go on n on with that n it's all from sharia law n islam in general, again they're just being as devout as po n want to abide by sharia law.

> ISIS is a pure example of this they are even referred to as khawarijs.

Does that change the fact that they abide by islam/sharia law n they are muslims, ur prophet was once like them.

> Iran is a whole other story about using religion in their favour to abuse people.

Iran is just another example of how islam ruins, destroys n contradicts democracy, freedom, human rights n civilisations, the islamic republic of iran is a theocracy, ruled by the shia clerics.

> And you're one of the people that I'm talking about who mixes actual religion with psychopaths.

It's very difficult to immigrate to Britain in general, the process is complicated and expensive. The rules change every time and with every upcoming election, the UK government and media love to portray us immigrants as the cause of all problems, so that means tightening the rules. And as someone pointed out in the comments, the process to get ILR (indefinite leave to remain) is tricky. 

First, check if your job is on the shortage occupation list. If it is, then check the registered list of sponsors, start looking for vacancies in your field from that list, and contact them by email. Just to note, there are new laws in place as of April so if someone has the license to sponsor you, your minimum income will have to be £38,700 (instead of the previous  £26,200) except for jobs related to health and care worker visa. The other option is studying and from there switching to something else, but it's also incredibly expensive.

Edit: I just found the formula for this. It’s 20% import tax and 19% VAT applied after the import tax and was changed in 2018. 

Consider MSRP Without Tax= price * 0.8 = 951.2€

Basically the price will be (European MSRP *1.2) *1.19 * fx = (951.2 * 1.2) * 1.19 * 3.35 = 4563 TND

For reference before the change, electronics were exempt from tariffs, paying only 3% and and only payed 6% VAT.

So the phone’s price would (European MSRP *1.03) *1.06 * fx= (951.2 * 1.03) * 1.06 *3.35= 3479 TND

A whopping 1000 TND difference or a 30% increase.

Your average person doesn’t ask on Reddit how to ask a girl out he just does it. It comes to him like a second nature just like you don’t ask how to eat or how to walk.  Don’t listen to advice coming from sociable people and especially wom*n. They didn’t go through such situation to know how to answer it.   

Personally, I’d advise you to stop pursing wom*n and focus instead on your health family, hobbies, career and most importantly religion.    

Wom*n do not matter     

Only the grind does.
