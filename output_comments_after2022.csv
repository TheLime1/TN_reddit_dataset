>Every woman has a right to tell you to fuck off if you're a mysogynist.

Wow, what a revolutionary take. But, is it actually relevant to what I said? When did I ever say that women don't have the right to say fuck off?

>And even worse- an incel.

Incel is short for involuntary celibate. Incel is a derogatory term because it's often associated with misogyny, but being an incel isn't worse than being a misogynist. Incel = someone who wants to be in a romantic relationship but can't (it can be due to his attractiveness, his personal sense of confidence. but it can also be due to misogyny which shapes his view world negatively and affects potential relationships). Misogyny = plain hatred against women.
Being a misogynist is way worse than being an incel if we base ourselves on standard definition.

>Women don't need to coddle you and risk their safety just so that you can stop crying.

That's cool, when did I say they should?

>Your misery and loneliness are your own doing.

That's partially true. Lonely people sometimes become lonely due to things outside their control. But I agree with you on the importance of bearing personal responsibility for your circumstances because it can lead to positive change.

You can do your own makeup, or you can also book a more skilled makeup artist (I recommend ""feryel studio"" or ""lobna ben ammar"" if your wedding is in Tunis).
Of course you can dance and party all night long, the sitting part is really outdated and usually only done for photos and for resting between dances ! As for the witness in baladeya, it can be a woman without any problem.
I would add one advice regarding alcohol, some tunisian families consume it openly in weddings, some prefer to hide it, some forbid it completely, so you should discuss it with your fiance beforehand and inform your own family about that.",2024-01-02 17:11:43

She also said she would be in grave danger of death if she ever comes back to Tunisia. The college believed her lies without fact-checking, granted her a scholarship and posted her essay in their website as a success story. They made it look like someone escaped North Korea or smth. Soon after, many Tunisians reacted to this, including academics from Tataouine, emailed the Minneapolis college to alert them.

Some countries have poor economy like venezeulla or argentina and they have visa free to europe because of the far distance between europe and them

Also, he didn't even tell their family members where he executed them and he even refused to give their remains to their families so they could bury them with dignity. Let's not forget he made it damn sure that their families were ostracized from society and made it illegal for anyone to help them or even interact with them. Lazhar Chrayti's family members were even asked to change their names in order for them to not be persecuted by the state. 

All of this after taking advantage of the resistance fighters and their armed struggle against the French, in order for him to eventually gain power and all of this after promising them a life of dignity and comfort after the independence. A promise which he obviously chose not to honor, since he was a pathological liar, tyrant and narcissist who only cared about himself.

You heavily subsidize/cover the losses of the second business with the first business money.

 - Being close  allies to the governing power ( turks , french , bourguibist , purple diarreha and trabelsia , ennahdha …)  which general  masses perceives as a betrayal for their causes and suffering 

- being extremely corrupt and unethical ( in a corrupt country that’s almost only way to get that rich). 

- using and abusing the working class in every possible way , from the lousy salaries to the hazards and risks they put their employees on ( nse elli tatla3 fil kmayen men teli for example)


Not that i completely agree with generalizing those ideas , but one can debate that those claims have some truth into them.

I believe most people choose something less heavy than the traditional wedding dresses for the townhall ceremony. What has been popular recently are suits inspired by traditional dresses. You’ll find quite a few businesses that specialize in that if you search in FB, IG, TikTok.

Again facts don't care about your feelings , the facts are he DID commit genocide, spreading misinformation to uneducated turks and tunisians but let me correct you rq the Armenian genocide didn't start and end in 1915. Ataurk commited genocide in Cilcia in 1919, in Marash in 1920 which was accompanied by large-scale slaughtering of the Armenians, spelled the beginning of the end for the remnant Armenian population, in October 1920 against the Armenians of hajen.

When the French formally agreed to evacuate Cilicia in October 1921, the debacle signified a second deportation for the Armenians of the region. 
In the meantime, the Turkish Nationalist forces had gone to war against the Republic of Armenia.

And the list if atrocities goes on, so before you spread misinformation remember in other subs it might work but here you get fact checked sentence by sentence.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian\_genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_genocide) Armenian Genocide happened in 1915 while Atatürk was a colonel in Galippoli. Even the most severe Turkophobes that have historica knowledge don't accuse him of genocide. I sometimes feel that people are doing this intentionally. Saying Atatürk he did the genocide is like saying Merkel did the Holocaust. They were not even there during the dates.

I personally don't believe that it is our right to decide if other nations can become shit with/without somethig. I am a Turk, I respect other nations and demand such from the others. I have my own identity, so do others.

Why be a lifeless moron that literally consumes his times ""Haha! No you are nothing haha! We gave you identity! You are worthless haha admit it!""The First Turkic Khaganate was established in 6th century even before Mohammed was born.

A person with a low IQ might not be able to do certain things but that is not the same as a population with an average IQ that is lower than other populations. To prove your theory, you need to provide evidence from well-conducted epidemiological studies showing that those who are born to cousins have on average lower IQ than those who were born to non-related parent in the SAME culture and environment.

During that period, as a Tunisian living abroad, I remember going to school holding my held high and feeling so proud and exited because I came from a country with such strong national teams, both in football and handball, and I knew that all of my friends had witnessed their strength as well, and were going to talk to me about it. This was my oxygen and my cryptonite. These were the things I literally lived for. 

It began with our football team taking home the winning trophy of CAN 2004, followed by the outstanding performance of our handball team at the 2005 world cup, and then our football team qualifying for the 2006 world cup.

If someone starts to use jargon or concepts that you dont understand  you should inform them . It is ok to not understand something, it is a sin and a huge loss of time for everyone when you pretend that you do .

Second , give a great importance to the quality of your code , writing code professionally is different then writing code for academic projects so take a minute to think about variable naming , classes and functions length and best practices in general 
Bonus : if you write  great detailed  documentation that would definitely leave a great impression

I am glad another tunisian is really feeling fed up w the whole ""A9RA ALLEMANDD"" stuff,language is culture,more than anything,you should learn a language youre culturally intresting in.As for what language I recommend,I recommend choosing based on two factors(if youre really doing this purely for fun,ofc)

First,I would recommend something you enjoy,and that has a big culture behind it,for example,espagnol has intresting lit,cinema,and internet presence,italian,russian too,japanese,chinese....you should also enjoy it,and find it beautiful.

Second,I really would recommend something excentric,why?You said you liked to learn new stuff,and the more obscure and distant is the language,the more different it is.You have to force your brain to think in new concepts,new  and it really fun if you do enjoy learning new stuff,languages with new concepts include chinese mandarin,russian,japanese.

choose based on these two criterias,my only recommendation is:self learning chinese is brutal,like borderline torture bc of the tones and script unless youre really into it,I wouldnt chose it,russian and jap are brutal but manageable,italian,swedish,spanish,are boring(imo,not an objective fact) but easy",2024-01-01 00:07:47

They know nothing about his achievements and the good he did for turkey and why turks see him as a hero and a founding father for turkey.

I read a little about Attaturk (not much but the basics  ) i know that during WWI he literally saved turkey from being split into multiple parts controlled by colonial powers, turkey was on the brink of losing its sovereignity, it was on the brink of losing Constantinople and hagia sophia but he came from a position of weakness with turkey almost losing everything, he led the armies and drove out all those who came with the goal to conquer and divide turkey. 

One other message perhaps for my fellow tunisians on why a great number of turks and attaturk hate arabs it's because they see that the arabs betrayed them and stabbed them in the back (which is true they betrayed the turks for the brits but then the arabs themselves were betrayed by the brits).

I honestly have nothing against turks.",2023-12-31 20:52:03

[https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1136&context=gc\_etds](https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1136&context=gc_etds)

Basically, on Mt Bou Qornine, a temple dated to the Roman era for Saturnus Balcaranensis was found in 1891. The assumption in 1896 was that the name implied an already existing sanctuary for Baal Hamon (Saturnus was identified with Baal Hamon by the Romans) and Balcaranensis was a Latin transcription of the Punic ""Baal Qarnaïm"" which meant ""Lord of the Horns"". The whole idea was to link Baal Hamon with the Hellenistic depictions of Zeus with two horns. The issue is there hasn't been a single depiction of Baal Hamon discovered that show him with horns. Not only that, but if we look at the name, it is ""Lord of the two horns"", not ""Lord with the two horns"", because in Punic (just like Arabic), a horn can imply an elevated area. In other words, if we assume this is a continuation of an already existing Punic sanctuary, then the inscription is dedicated to Baal Hamon, the Lord of the Two Horns (Peaks). The epithet was toponymic, not descriptive of a God

>A similar mistranslation in the case of Qarnaïm is not surprising, as it is now generally recognized that the epithet does not connote the horns which would eventually come characterize the god (after late contamination with the cult of Zeus/Jupiter Ammon), but is purely toponymic in reference, indicating the remarkable situation of the sanctuary on the taller of the twin peaks of Bu-Kournein, and not any special characteristic of the god",2023-12-31 20:44:17
