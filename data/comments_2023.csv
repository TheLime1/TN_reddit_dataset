They know nothing about his achievements and the good he did for turkey and why turks see him as a hero and a founding father for turkey.

I read a little about Attaturk (not much but the basics  ) i know that during WWI he literally saved turkey from being split into multiple parts controlled by colonial powers, turkey was on the brink of losing its sovereignity, it was on the brink of losing Constantinople and hagia sophia but he came from a position of weakness with turkey almost losing everything, he led the armies and drove out all those who came with the goal to conquer and divide turkey. 

One other message perhaps for my fellow tunisians on why a great number of turks and attaturk hate arabs it's because they see that the arabs betrayed them and stabbed them in the back (which is true they betrayed the turks for the brits but then the arabs themselves were betrayed by the brits).

I honestly have nothing against turks.",2023-12-31 20:52:03

[https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1136&context=gc\_etds](https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1136&context=gc_etds)

Basically, on Mt Bou Qornine, a temple dated to the Roman era for Saturnus Balcaranensis was found in 1891. The assumption in 1896 was that the name implied an already existing sanctuary for Baal Hamon (Saturnus was identified with Baal Hamon by the Romans) and Balcaranensis was a Latin transcription of the Punic ""Baal Qarnaïm"" which meant ""Lord of the Horns"". The whole idea was to link Baal Hamon with the Hellenistic depictions of Zeus with two horns. The issue is there hasn't been a single depiction of Baal Hamon discovered that show him with horns. Not only that, but if we look at the name, it is ""Lord of the two horns"", not ""Lord with the two horns"", because in Punic (just like Arabic), a horn can imply an elevated area. In other words, if we assume this is a continuation of an already existing Punic sanctuary, then the inscription is dedicated to Baal Hamon, the Lord of the Two Horns (Peaks). The epithet was toponymic, not descriptive of a God

>A similar mistranslation in the case of Qarnaïm is not surprising, as it is now generally recognized that the epithet does not connote the horns which would eventually come characterize the god (after late contamination with the cult of Zeus/Jupiter Ammon), but is purely toponymic in reference, indicating the remarkable situation of the sanctuary on the taller of the twin peaks of Bu-Kournein, and not any special characteristic of the god",2023-12-31 20:44:17
