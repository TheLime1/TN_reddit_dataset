I work at the US Embassy and there are zero reports that any American has been attacked in any recent times.  There were a couple of terrorist attacks years ago and a lady blew herself up about a month ago but she killed noone but herself.

Tatouine WAS a place to not go to for about 2 years but they have heavily increased security there.  If you go there, if you tell the hotel you are from out of Tunisia (or they suspect you are) then you will be probably see more people around you as they are security.  Tunisia is doing everything they can to make it safer and it's working.  Just as was told.  Try to stay away from the borders of Libya especially as well as Algeria up north and you're fine.  Hell, I was even up north and 5 minutes from Algeria and never once felt unsafe.

The dangers of traveling to Tunisia are WILDLY oversold.  It's perfectly fine here.

That said, you would still be well advised to take cautions just as you would in any country about theft.  It happens here just as it does anywhere so always be on your guard as you're a tourist and a bigger target.  That, however, isn't a Tunisian issue, that's a everywhere issue.",2018-12-09 08:32:44

Actually we are the arab country that has most hope of a better future. 
(Look at the 2 neighbouring countries : Libya is indulging into a civil war while Algeria bets all of its economy on Gas, a strategy that will bring it misery in the long term)

If you do feel depressed about the current situation, try to improve it. Even if you dont correct a lot of things, if everyone does just a little bit, the sum will be big.

e02i3jt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/8od0nw/,13,"- The sea .

The beach quality in Tunisia is great, much better than that of southern Europe. (Sand quality + general activities) 

- The food.

Tunisian food doesnt make you fat as opposed to the creamy european food. And yet, it's delicious !!

- Prices

Maids in Tunisia are ridiculously cheap compared to Europe, as it is a third world country.

Same thing for hotels and for services given by people in general.

- Customs 

Just like Spain we ve got plenty of parties but those are a mix of European and arabic style.

- Geographical diversity

The north is full of beaches while the south is full of deserts and the ""in between"" holds peculiar landscape.

- Cultural Diversity

The north has a European like culture while the south and center have a middle eastern culture.

Tunisia also have its own music style and traditional clothing.

- Historical monuments and ruins

Carthage and more generally the coast holds beautiful ruins dating back to the Carthaginian and Roman Empire.
Kairouan holds ""The great mosque of kairouan"" an extremely old and beautiful mosque that is famous worldwide.

- The mentalities

Tunisians are not ""cold"" like europeans. They are much warmer which gives a ""family like feeling"" when you spend time with them .

BTW tunisians are not afraid of hugging each other or holding hands, even as friends, it's very common.

People are also very conservative compared to Europeans .

- Attractiveness?

Tunisian people are very attractive. Their body is as sculpted as black people while their skin and features are closer to Europeans which gives a good mix.
(Fat people are btw much rarer than in Europe)

Also, just like any other third world country, people in there dont lack sex drive.

And that's it I guess.

e6qyed0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/9jekip/,12,"German with internship in Tunis incoming: 

Most Tunisians, especially lower class, don't give a shit about recycling or keeping things clean, which again leads to a hen-egg-problem. If it's already dirty, the inhibition threshold is lowered to add (= throw) more garbage on the ground. Also, there is no incentive for e. g . not just throwing bottles anywhere. We have a refund system, so throwing a plastic bottle away immediately makes you lose 25 ct (= 750 Millimes). 

Another problem in my opinion are all those free plastic bags. In Germany you are expected to bring your own bag when shopping because bags cost extra, usually 20 ct to 1 euro. When I once went shopping here, I brought my own backpack out of habit and the lady was really confused, why I didn't want to use the bags provided by her. 

Additionally, by the high number of smokers, you find cigarette butts everywhere contributing to the pollution. When I've been in Singapore, you saw a lot of sings saying ""dropping a cigarette butt costs 500$"" (or was it even 2000$?) and so on, so they make you think twice if it's really worth it not throwing it into a bin. 

So I think it's a cultural thing, too, as I have the feeling that there are way less public trash cans. 

Luckily, there are a few organizations raising awareness for this problem and showing that plastic for example can be recycled to fuel. I hope that they will be successful in the near future as it is a huge waste of resources, too. ",2018-09-27 18:32:15

I'm an American (Guy) here in Tunisia but this is something that should be a requirement, honestly.  This lets the Embassy know of your general whereabouts while here.  If you're from elsewhere, check out your Embassy if they have a registration program as well.

Generally, females are safe here.  I would say that you need to make sure that you use best practices.  This is a modest/Muslim country so I'd recommend not wearing anything too risque or would attract attention.  You probably won't be targeted more for your being female but more so that you're a tourist so, make sure you're on guard when out and about, just as you would anywhere else.

I've lived in Tunisia for 4 years and I've never had an issue.  My wifes sister had her phone snatched from Her but that's all I know of any sort of crime personally.

do not have ""the right to life"" in Muslim countries. They are to be killed. Muslim doctors of law generally divide sins into great sins and little sins. Of the seventeen great sins, unbelief is the greatest, more heinous than murder, theft, adult-
ery, etc.
 
4. Slavery is recognized in the Koran. Muslims are allowed to cohabit with any of their female slaves (sura 4.3); they are allowed to take possession of married women if they are slaves (sura 4.28). The helpless position of the slave in regard 
to his or her master illustrates the helpless position of the false gods of Arabia 
in the presence of their Creator (sura 16.77).",2018-11-25 12:13:54

My morality comes from a feeling of empathy -- when I see somebody else suffering, it causes me suffering also. As a result I feel compelled to prevent or reduce the suffering in the world, especially when it is caused by my own actions. Same goes for making somebody else happy, it feels good when you cause somebody else's joy.

By the same reasoning, Stalin and Hitler did something wrong because they created a lot of suffering in the world by oppression, murder, war, racism, and I empathize with those who suffered.",2018-11-27 01:53:32

dvktdn4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/83uwlu/,9,"Very interesting question and I believe I can answer at least half of it!

While article 1 of the constitution states that Islam is the religion of the state, article 6 protects freedom of religion and practice.

 &gt;  It guarantees freedom of conscience and belief,
the  free  exercise  of  religious  practices  and  the  neutrality  of  mosques  and  places  of worship from all partisan instrumentation

Now, considering the case of atheism, it is pretty much regarded as a religion in of itself (It has a legal status akin to that of buddhism and taoism. Special status for judaism and chistianity, but let's not dwell on that). So yes, an atheist is protected by this freedom of belief.

However, tunisians are socially considered muslims by default (any tunisian is expected to, if not practice, at least believe in islam. And instead of considering an atheist tunisian, well, atheist. He/She will be considered apostate (having left the religion).

The way apostates are viewed depends from individual to individual. And seeing as the moral code is closely related to religious practice, you will still be expected to act according to religious practice in most cases.

The most fascinating, to me, is in regards to the law, where moral judgement will be derived from religious practice whether you are a believer or not, but that varies widely from case to case.

I hope I have answered your question and you have any more you want to know, please let me know.

dxka2ns,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/8d4sb5/,9,"Tunisia was secular for prior to the revolution. Now they are struggling to find their identity. In the capital Tunis I met many people including lesbian couples, gay guys, who were not religious at all. They drank on a daily basis. Basically very European in their way of thinking. 

On the other hand, even in Tunis and more so in the country side, there are religious Tunisians who think that in the post revolution Tunisia they can finally go back to their religious roots. Outside the capital Islam is still the norm. For instance I met a some young rappers in Sidi Bouzid they were really struggling to be who they wanted to be. They started a hip hop center for the youth, but the elders/gov (not sure who exactly) shut it down because it was not Tunisian enough. They were told Tunisians don’t make hip hop they make couscous. 

There was one Muslim girl I met in Tunis who started wearing a head scarf in university and her teachers and family really gave her a hard time, she felt very discriminated against. 

More than any country I’ve been to, Tunisia is a country searching for it’s identity. They are so close to Europe and their history is intertwined with Italy/France and the Mediterranean that in many ways it is very (Southern) European, but on the other hand they’ve been controlled by the ottomans and have a long history of Islam. So that is a loaded question that Tunisians would spend hours discussing.

eak4y0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/a0pfeu/,9,"There are centuries of philosophy trying to answer that. I cannot understand how basing a faith on an old book written in prose could be effective at all. Meanwhile, many other philosophers are able to criticize each other and build from many different literature (including the holy books).

Cons against a holy book:

* It is old and will never update

* It is local in space and time, it was made for a specific population on a given location and century, with local habits and an old language

* Tend to have violent, sexists, and racists passages

* Some times include many gods

* There is not a clear criterion to choose one holy book book over another

Pro for ethics based on World philosophy:

* Some of the books were written as a commentary on another author, so you can compare points of view

* Most philosophy books are written using reason, argumentation and logic. 

* Some times include a God, sometimes do not 

* A new important book each century is almost guaranteed (written in modern language and with modern translation techniques )

* Only old philosophers include sexism and slavery, most books now do not

* Different views do not necessarily mean moral relativism, getting to know Kant, utilitarism, contractualism etc gives you different tools to evaluate a given situation and to understand its consequences

* you can still keep some of your cultural costumes to honor your history

Also: the Human rights are a set of values that most people agree on that is very good for keeping ethics in place

&gt;How is Tunisia doing?

From which side? 

i'm gonna presume you mean overall 
Well economicly the government made new austerity measures in order to reduce the budget deficiency to less than 5%, well that was good on paper until the new measuers took place since it fueled many protests across the country under the slogan ‘فاش نستنو‘ 'what are we waiting for', people are talking about a sencond Uprising especially since tomorrow happens  to be the 8th revolution memory 

&gt;And why is it so underrated in its role in the Arab Spring?

As it is mentioned  above there is no big interest in our country since we're a small one with limited natural resources 

&gt;Is Mohamed Bouazizi considered a national hero?

short answer : no

Long answer : Bouazizi was not a war hero, he was some random guy who felt the oppression and decided enough is enough and sat himself on fire, during ben ali regime the question was not who is gonna start the uprising, it's when 

&gt;Where is Tunisia going to?

Nobody knows for now but hopefully  to a better place

dxl7b4v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/8d4sb5/,7,"&gt; Tunisia and Tunisians are liberal/secular or islamists?

North is secular (a lot of contact with Europeans + rich), South is islamist (poor + no contact with Europe).

&gt; How religious are Tunisians?

In the North, religious people are discriminated against. (most are ""cultural muslims"" or ""progressive muslims"").

In the rest, they are the norm.

&gt; How is the life for non muslims

Great in the North. Freedom of religion is guaranteed by the State and people dont care much whether you re muslim or not. (if you are muslim, you will receive thumbs up, if you arent, you will be seen as ""westernized"").

&gt; lgbt people in Tunisia

Homosexual activity is punished by up to 3 years in jail.

However, since the revolution, there is a ""big lgbt"" movement in Tunisia. AN official LGBT newspaper has been launched and an organization that protects and helps LGBT people (shams) has been created.

It is expected that the current punishment for LGBT people will still be there in the next few years but will only be in ""theory"".

Currently, lgbt people are punished but proving that someone has homosexual activity isnt that easy. The ""usual"" mean to prove it is expected to be banned within a few years (according to the current party).

However homosexuality wont be depenalized according to the head of the current party in power (nida Tounis).

&gt; Tunisia is liberal/secular or islamists?

Depends on what time : 

If Nida Tounis wins, it's very liberal/secular, if Ennahda wins, it's ""moderate"" islamism .

There arent many other parties that can win currently ever since the policy of the ""vote utile"" (useful vote) has been adopted by the secular tunisians.

Just after the revolution, the secular tunisians lost against Ennahda (islamic party) because their votes were too spread among many parties, they ve started focusing on one party at a time. So basically, the whole secular area decides of someone and every secular person is to vote for him. (The decision/advertisement of the decision)  is made via Social networks.

In the end we can say that Tunisia is a young and fragile democracy. 

It isnt a real democracy yet as secular people cant vote for the real party they want to elect since they have to deal with islamists.

And islamists cant get their islamic party elected since secular are more numerous (North is overcrowded/ South is unpopulated) so they are somehow unsatisfied.

See : (Population density)

Look at this (Political repartition): https://nawaat.org/portail/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/carte-politique-tunisie.png

It sums things up. North is a ""country"" (everyone votes nida), south is another ""country"" (everyone votes islamist) and middle is a mix.

Obviously the one and strongest identity is being Tunisian. Heritage (just like every other subject, really) only started being debated in 2011 (are we arabs? Are we berbers? Cultures being erased, etc). Personally, I’m light skinned so I guess my ancestors were berbers; and those that are dark skinned have Arab ancestors, but I don’t really give much of a shit, I’m not going to look any further, I’m just Tunisian (and thus maghrebin). And our language is a derivative from Arab so I guess you can say it’s an Arab country. 
The thing is, a shitload of people have habitated our little country, but when the Muslims colonized it in the 7th century, there was an ethnocid, thus still having light skinned people but *virtually* no berber culture. 
We were a dictatorship from 1956 (our independence from France) to 2011, so history wasn’t really a super important subject. And I think most Tunisians now aren’t aware of our country’s history, and identify their history with the coran. 

Please take this with a grain of salt because I’m no specialist, I’m just interested in the subject matter 

3. It’s definitely not mostly secular. I think you have a mix of non practicing  and practicing religious. It’s a mostly conservative country. you’ve got your fair share of leftists, but we’re clearly a minority.

4. I’m generally pessimistic as fuck about the world, but kind of optimistic about Tunisia because 
1. we have a lot of potential- as do all poor countries in my opinion, but
2. We’re lucky to be in a geographical place that doesn’t have that much earth ressources, so we’re safe (well, safer) from western imperialism

So on average I’m hopeful but skeptical.
I don’t have scientific data that answers your question about all young people, but in my experience they lean more towards pessimism.

The political climate is heated, but not that bad I think.

eaftc4s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/a08l25/,7,"Hey! I make mine usually with tuna fish, and you can change the filling as you like, but mine is pretty basic! All these measurements are approximations, I just throw in what I usually have available to me.

\- 1 can tuna

\- 1 small onion, chopped

\- about 1/2 cp chopped up parsley

\- about 2 tablespoon butter

\--- mix these up in a little pot on the fire until the onion is soft and the butter is melted.

\- Add salt/pepper to taste.

This amount will usually make around 4-5ish brik for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Other ingredients:

\- 1 egg per brik

\- malsouka (I bring mine back from tunisia and freeze them... Can't seem to find a good replacement in the US). 

Heat up your oil in a large enough pan to accommodate a folded up triangle of brik. Use a neutral oil (canola), or use olive if you want the taste of olive oil in your brik, but careful cause it burns at higher temps. I usually just use canola or vegetable oil. You can test the oil by dropping in a bit of malsouka and see how fast it browns. If it browns immediately, lower the temp a bit, and your oil is ready.

&amp;#x200B;

Some tips when forming your brik triangles:

\- Sacrifice one malsouka and cut it into quarters. Use these smaller pieces as support in the center of your brik, under the filling+egg. I do this to prevent the brik from breaking and leaking egg into the oil. Some people use two full malsoukas per brik, but that's too much for me. The smaller piece usually works fine.

\- When you place your filling in the middle of the brik, create a small little well in the middle for the egg, this prevents the egg from sliding all over the place!

\- Immediately after you place your brik in the hot oil, use tongs (or whatever utensil you're using), to hold down the ""folds"" so they don't open in the oil. Just for a couple of seconds is enough. You just want to make sure each side sticks to the other side and doesn't let the egg slip out. 

\- Don't overcook the egg ;) The tradition is that when you eat the brik you gotta suck in the yolk to prevent it from spilling on your dish! Also, make sure you use some lemon on the brik! It's tasty.

They basically have all the power over us, we do not have power over them. Not economically, where European companies have a field day extracting our natural resources and paying the local workers and the government dirt cheap in return (in Tunisia at least, they don't pay any taxes for petrol extraction).

Not politically, where they pay our corrupt people at power enough bribes to keep the status quo that favors their companies (and to stay our No°1 trade partner, instead of us trading and integrating more with our direct neighbors), under the guise of ""aid and loans"" that just stays in their pockets and doesn't get circulated into the economy (and not into the non-coastal, poor and dry internal regions, if it ever does), but at the expense of the economy and country at large who's seeing its infrastructure degrading by the day, its debt ballooning, its inflation and costs of living rising, and its natural and human resources literally sucked away as a consequence (again speaking here only for Tunisia, though I'm almost sure it's the same for most countries in the region. Morocco seems to be doing a bit better than us).

Yeah and I won't talk (yet) about our history with France in particular. I'll be writing books at this point. Though I'll just say that France threatened to intervene in the beginning of our revolution to keep Ben Ali in power, and that the current French ambassador is considered by many to be the real man in charge of the country (similarities to the state of country before its independence are unintentional).",2018-12-18 11:25:06

For instance, we often organise events in the Roman odeons and amphitheatres, while mosaics and amphora making is a traditional art, there is also the baths (turkish or roman) or the traditional houses (Dar) and buildings that are similar in style to the ones of ancient carthage and rome with a central atrium.

From what I recall from history, the vandal period wasn't really seen as one of prosperity by the population and they readilly welcomed the byzantines (belisarius) back when they came back. 

Were they somewhat influencical ?
I am not sure, but for instance a subburb of Tunis is called Ariana, that people linked to the vandal because many of their artifacts were found there, also the vandals were of Arian faith. There is also a certain portion of Tunisians that are blond or even ginger, they perhaps have some german ancestors, or perhaps it is of another origin, this is a moot point as it happened so long ago.",2018-01-31 10:13:31

Third people don't need a tech rev they need food and knowledge. It would be far more beneficial to invest in education than technology. Moreover we still don't have the right to produce anything without the approval of the countries we owe money to.

On the other side, I don't actually believe we need freedom. We actually don't know how to use it in the right way or even how to make good use of it. Also I don't believe that living in a society gives enough space to have real freedom. In addition to that I don't think that a democratic system really matters because the majority of people did not learn how to choose, they often fixate on some irrelevant point. I don't really care about the nature of the system nor freedom as long as the country is advancing in economics, health and education. I don't mind living in a country like Iran if it provides me with a good education, good health insurance and a good job.

=
However if, for all the reasons that are out there, if we're doomed to not have a strong national language and to rely on foreign languages to actually do shit, we'd rather do it in English first rather than French, thank you very much. French itself is losing ground in mainland France, English is just that strong, because France itself is infinitesimally weaker than the USA.

=
Multilinguism, bilinguism,..... are not the issue here. They are a nice bonus to those who can, but they are not what makes a country successful, or what makes it rule the world. China and the USA are not missing anything vital by not emphasizing it to their own citizens at every corner. For most normal people, not having to learn a bazillon of language just to be able to live their daily lives is rather a sign of their own strength, not weakness. 

=
They should have a strong national language first and foremost. Then we let them decide on their own and with **TOTAL FREEDOM** whether they want to learn another language, and expand ""their vocabularies and horions"" or not.

Chances are, unless they work in the political and literary field, or jobs that require language learning like Tourism and Outsource working, they'll only restrict themselves to another language or two that they have to learn for their particular interests (like Otakus learning Japanese to better enjoy Animes and Mangas). Otherwise language learning is just another burden for most normal people and they don't have enough time as it is.

=
And the ""sad"", **""SAD""** truth, is that France has been in decline since World War 2. It's using its remaining clout to try and rebuild its past glory (when it was still a colonial force). USA also has some recent decline but it's nowhere near as it is pronounced with France.

=

O hey, about that France, did you know [The extent to which France went to eradicate all its local languages and dialects that existed before the Third republic ? In 1789, 50 percent of the French people did not speak [French] at all, and only 12 to 13 percent spoke it fairly well](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7u8oyk/how_true_is_this_claim_in_1789_50_percent_of_the/dtj3h5u/)

=
France wants **only** French to be the official language of the French Republic [1] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_France#Status) [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_policy_in_France#Minority_languages_and_endangered_languages), but it wants ""multilinguism"" for its former colonies. They want to be alarmed about the prolificacy of English withing its youth, but damned we are if we dare raise the same alarms about French here. 

=
So to France and to her local cronies, we can safely say, **FUCK YOU**. You are **ABSOLUTELY NOT** a good role model. You are hypocrits and you only think about your own narrow interests, whatever you think they are. So we too look for ours. It is precisely because we've been in a one-sided relationship with you that was mostly in your favor for so long that we want to **AT LEAST ""diversify the zones of influences""**. That's **OUR** motto, not yours. France holds way too much economical and political power in Tunisia compared to its real geopolitical significance. It's time that this has stopped. 

=
Not that we like English or the USA that much. But **The enemy of my enemy is my friend**, my ""friend""...

We also need to deal with Russia, China, and even the eeeeeeeeviiiil Türkiye, not just the goddamned EU or USA, if that makes you any better....

e2cwhy6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/8yowio/,5,"I am reading conflicting information on free movement and trade between Libya and Tunisia. The Libyan market (for business-oriented people) is the strongest and perhaps only use for Tunisian citizenship for anyone who isn't currently a citizen of Syria, Iraq, Iran, Cuba, Afghanistan, Sudan or North Korea.

Apparently the two have freedom of movement for citizens (or at least, a Tunisian could leave Libya and immediately return, not like the 90/180 rule for visa-free access to the Schengen area, but like the visa policy in Tunisia where people not interested in getting residency permits can fly to Europe and return on the same day) and free trade (this I was told, by a businessman, is still in place) for companies incorporated in the two countries, but I also read that companies in Libya cannot be owned by foreigners as of December 2013 (if I recall the date correctly).

I am a European with an EU (until March of next year, that is) passport. I get treated differently to Tunisians on a personal level, but I wouldn't give up the ability to be a ""tourist"" and instead become vulnerable to police screwing around with in exchange for visa-free access to Libya and Algeria. If Tunisia was... at least like Russia, where foreigners and locals are treated alike, it would make a good addition to my collection of passports.

The other issue is that becoming a resident means you pay a 6&amp;#37; tax on the purchase of a property instead of 1&amp;#37; for non-residents. In order for me to become a Tunisian citizen, I would have to be a resident (and thus, tax resident) for a while. I am currently registered in a zero-tax jurisdiction and owe no-one anything. I have heard (and this may be a rumor) that a Swiss couple has been waiting for 30 years to become Tunisian and has still not received citizenship. In truth, I have never come across a non-Tunisian-looking individual with a Tunisian passport. I don't want to pay taxes for 30 years, to maybe not get citizenship, to then (if I were to acquire the citizenship) be subject to the treatment that Tunisians get in their own country at the hands of their government - I moved to Tunisia because I am treated better there than in the UK.

Another thing to consider is that, perhaps like Italy, (who considers anyone with Italian blood to be legible for and thus automatically a citizen of Italy), you may already be a Tunisian citizen (de jure) without you showing up at the embassy/relevant government offices and making your existence known. A child born to American parents is American at birth, even if born abroad, and thus if the child came to the US on a French passport and asked for consular assistance, information about his origins would be taken into consideration and it would become known at that point that the child is a US citizen on US soil and is thus not legible for protection from the US embassy.

Again, treatment as a Brit in Tunisia, protection from the embassy vs treatment as a Tunisian. What would you go with?",2018-07-14 03:09:44

The fact that my Arabic isn't very good didn't help either. Since then I've moved and lived in many different places, but I carry my Tunisian side mainly through how I decorate my home, and all the food I cook. Nothing like making mloukhia for a bunch of Americans 😂

&gt; The current rules relating to succession, contained in the Code of Personal Status, although inspired by Muslim law, are promulgated as rules of positive law, and applied to Tunisians, Muslims or non-Muslims.
Repealing or amending the said rules does not mean repealing or amending the ""shariaa"", but that changes will be made to the positive Tunisian legal order.

We are not changing the shariaa, we are changing the rules in our country that should be suitable for both believers and non-believers. Saying that the chariaa is untouchable doesn't mean much because we are not touching it.

Our country already ""violates"" the shariaa in some ways, like giving women the right to divorce and abort her baby regardless of their spouses opinion. One more law that that goes against it won't change that fact.

Yes, there are many pressing matters like our economy, doesn't mean we should not make laws that ensure a better future in terms of equality while we can.

After the [Serbian army's retreat through Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_army%27s_retreat_through_Albania) in 1915, during the World War, part of the army was transported by the French navy to their naval base in Bizerte. Serbian soldiers, and a small number of civilians, arrived in Bizerte on three occasions. In December 1915 and early 1916, after the Albanian Golgotha, then later in 1916 after the first clashes on the [Salonica Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salonica_Front) in Greece and in the early 1917 when Serbian volunteers began to gather in Bizerte. The last Serbian soldiers left on 18 August 1919.

In terms of rights, now, we have many more than before : Freedom of speech becomes a real/actual thing \(and that's great\).

That being said, many tunisians would argue that you cant eat rights and they arent wrong.

The country faces huge unemployment rates. Thanks to the terrorists, now, the tourism field is almost dead. You have plenty of people who get a degree but cant do anything with it.

These issues are mainly thanks to an awful management, coming from political reasons.

We have many many parties but currently only 2 have real, actual chances of getting into power : Ennahda and Nida. Ennahda is the islamist party so the tunisian north \(most populatedd area\) doesnt vote for it =\&gt; low chances of getting in power unless something big happen.

Nida has many, many issues \(just like the other little parties\), they were built very quickly because the revolution happened very suddenly \(no one expected that\). Because of that, they \(all including Nida\) are full of ""opportunist"", incompetent people. Said people just want a title, money coming from it and a comfortable position.

So they are kind of unwilling to get into their party competent people who would try to get into the ""important positions"" and get the incompetent out .

=\&gt; Not many people in said parties are very competent . And it doesnt want ""new people"".

That's how you get non english speaking ministers in a country full of educated people \*sigh\*

Now it looks more and more like a masquerade. Just look at the municipal elections.

You have many people that havent an ounce of eloquence and that want to get elected.

They are just for show and in their party for money and position, obviously, to the point that they are not even able to say anything about their party's program \(seriously?\).

We ve got some videos of people from both Ennahda and Nida who want to be elected in the municipal elections and.... its laughable, they dont even know how to lie properly. It's ridiculously obvious that they are there for show/for the position, while actually competent people are unemployed =\&gt; Management gets even worse =\&gt; Economical situation of the country gets even worse too.

1) Make sure your internet connection isn't very bad, it could prevent the reCAPTCHA (that image) from loading or keep you from being connected to their server.

2) If you're on PC use chrome or Firefox and avoid internet explorer and edge.

3) Make sure you're not attempting to connect at peak hours, college students are using their e-dinar cards intensively recently to pay their inscription fees, so you might need to make sure the website doesn't get overloaded (I'd advice you to try early morning 4~5 am).

4) The issue could be due to the website itself being broken, it's Tunisia so that happens *sigh*.

Feel free to elaborate a bit, as in how are you unable to use the reCAPTCHA? doesn't it load? are you unable to type it (broken textbox)? are you always unable to get the text to match what's written in the image? some other kind of problem? Did you manage to login to your account before?

Finally i would highly recommend eating the street food either the sandwiches in the capital tunis or other typical street foods like lablebi, ijja etc.. Trust me you won’t be disappointed, there’s nothing to hate about Tunisia. And people there tend to be very friendly with tourists. 
PS : you can go to sidi bou said for an evening, that like old cities in other countries but so beautiful and you can eat bambalouni while you’re at it. Oh yeah also you need to try some fish dishes.

ds1ptr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/7kl343/,3,"No idea what you're saying (American in Tunisia here and I don't speak the language well) opening a legit Comic Book Shop in Tunisia would be quite difficult.  I've looked into the idea, and even drew up a business plan for it, but frankly, the demand isn't here for what the upfront costs would be.

Since it's overseas from the only distributor, You have to order $1000 USD Minimum a month.  Also ""We are the exclusive distributor for DC, Dark Horse, Image, IDW, and Marvel Comics; they are all available to you for import. Most toys and statues are also available, but again as I’m sure you’re aware, there are some items that we do not have the international rights to distribute into your country. We sell almost anything comic book or movie related.""

Also it would cost upwards of $100-$200 to have them shipped (per month).  So you're talking $1200 a month.  Comic books are sold two months in advance to vendors but not shipped so they have to purchase the comics and wait and you're talking about a lot of upfront costs.  On top of that, import taxes that the government will put onto everything.

To break even, you would have to sell about $1300 (3200TND) in merchandise.  Per month. When you factor in costs of everything else like rent and etc, you're talking an easy 5500 to 6000 TND a month in sales needed to stay open and turn a profit.  The problem with that is you'd have to sell comics at about 10-15TND each!  This is way out of the price range for most people that would be the target market for this stuff (College age and younger) when you consider that they are hit with a 25% unemployment rate and when you talk about underemployemnt it's close to 50%.

The costs are too high and the demand is too low.  However, you can buy digital comics or if you want to pirate them, I can help anyone do that too.",2018-01-01 19:49:59

dsbyx22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/7orv5f/,3,"**Ultras**

Ultras are a type of football fan renowned for ultra-fanatical support. They are predominantly followers of association football teams.

The behavioural tendency of ultras groups includes the use of flares (primarily in tifo choreography), vocal support in large groups and the displaying of banners at football stadiums, all of which are designed to create an atmosphere which encourages their own team and intimidates opposing players and supporters. The use of elaborate displays in stadiums often is common, as well.

Lebelbi - Tunisian Mall, food court, there is a place up top that has it and it's delicious (Make sure you mix it all up before eating it)

Bambaloni - Best place, like someone said, is Sidi Bou Said [I prefer this place](https://goo.gl/maps/V9E2qyQXLLR2).  They also have Fricase and it's delicious and fresh.  Extremely popular place so if you go on the weekends, especially in the evenings during the summer time, there will be a line about 40 people deep but it moves quickly.

Brik - Find a small shop that sells the fresh pastry for it.  Far better than the shit you'll find in monoprix or carrefour.  You can find how to make it online.

As far as things to see?  Right now it's a bit tough as this is the down season and it's REALLY cold and Tunisia is known for the beaches which, you don't really wanna go to right now unless you cover up a lot.

The guy is not some genius who came up with thie above ""argument"". It's a pretty well known and oft-repeated one. Problem is, it's a profoundly dishonest and misleading argument. Anyone who uses it unironically, immediately loses all credibility because they are either :

- Ignorant enough to not even bother checking if the argument they heard and are spewing mindlessly has any actual basis.

- or worse, know that the argument is bogus and continue pushing it, while claiming to ""defend"" a religion where honesty is one of the most important values.

&gt; no idea why you're heated.

Because people with no knowledge or with no honesty should better just shut up instead of acting like moral or religious authorities. Once that is done maybe we can have an actual conversation.

dvklpfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/83p02i/,3,"&gt; women, as a whole, aren't below men because they receive the inheritance in more cases.

No, because all those cases are bogus. A deceased's sister **never** inherits more than his brother, his mother **never** more than his father,  his daughter **never** more than his son, his aunt **never** more than his uncle. See the pattern?

 However, his own daughter will inherit more than his second uncle on his mother's side. And while maybe true, it is hardly a valid ""case"" where women inherit more than a man (^(it actually proves the contrary if you think enough about why in most of these cases, some male distant relative appears in the heirs while his female equivalent is left out or, again, given less. But that's already further complicating a simple argument))

I don't really wish to have this convo again.

About the nafaqa bit or the ""social safety net"", while this is a different topic altogether and only used to muddy the waters here, I think you'll find that most principled people will not be against a more ""egalitarian"" nafaqa or even removing it outright. If a the wife is the bread bearer of the family while the man makes less or is unemployed (have you never seen this in Tunisia?), then there is no need to have the man pay nafaqa to his ex-wife just because he has a penis.

Si on avait une alliance économique maghrebine, elle pourrait avoir droit à l'Atlantique en passant par le Maroc.

dzvae8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/8nbr7t/,3,"&gt; Why do you have to make a speech about it?

From what I know, basically he refused to promote someone from the president's family and... Nida wanted to kick him out.

He wanted to stay (and hopefully keep promoting deserving people?) so he made this speech in order to ensure his stay.

&gt; Some people out there have a hard time staying alive, and you decide to tell them Hafedh Kaid Essebssi is a bad person? We already know. And the excuse for why he is wasting our time with this: Because Nida's problem is Tunisia's problem. This is wrong on so many levels! If a party has the capacity to hurt the state, then the party must be isolated from the state, not try to fix it. 

Guess what? trying to change parties might lead to ennadha's victory which no one wants

&gt; Our PM should concentrate on running the country, not on solving the problems of some party or the other.

He said he isnt used to mingling with those things. He just wants to focus on running the country but if they are on the verge of kicking him out for not promoting the president's family, well yeah, he's right to use the people to ensure his stay.


No matter whether what I ve been told is true or not, this political move is a good one. He uses his popularity to bet on the people to ensure his stay at Nida. 
In the speech, he also gives a few hint to many, many politicians over what should be done and tries to encourage people to come/improve things

That shows some skills . At least compared to other politicians running the country, he is politically competent. That's a good sign, no matter what is your political opinion or your priorities.

&gt; Some people out there have a hard time staying alive

There's no choice :/ Sadly Tunisia needs to go through that in order to get better.

Think this way : As long as we manage to improve tunisia's economical situation, since it is a democracy and having people that are politically competent, it will have all the requirements to be a ""regular developed country"".

The ""improve economy"" part is the hardest but pretty much the only big obstacle we ve got ahead of us.

As for it being difficult, yes it is.
Can things improve faster? yes they can.

but... deal with it :/

General conduct:

* I'd advice against loitering around government buildings, or hotels. Usually some policeman would ""kindly"" tell you to exit the premises.
* If you smoke RYO tobacco keep it home and don't smoke it in public, everyone will think it's a joint. Also every 7ammas sells rolling paper it's just hidden.
* As tempting it may seem, please don't cross the Z4, X20 or route X on foot, there are pedestrian bridges for that.
* Don't respond to ""trah ngiss"" requests.
* If you're a girl catcalling is frequent in centre ville but rare in the suburbs. Eventually it'll become part of the background noise.

Public transport:

* If you're in banlieue sud then public transport won't be an issue, but if you're on the outskirts of Ariana start saving up for a car because that 527 is not coming on time because L'escale's Roundabout is a mess.
* If you're a smoker wait until the taxi driver lights up his cigarette and then ask if you can smoke too, this would avoid some issues. If you're a guy sit up front, if you're a girl sit in the back.
* On line 2 you'd get the chance to meet the ""action"" guy and if you do ask him ""kifech l tachkila lyoum?"". He's a nice guy so buy a pack of gum from him once in a while.
* Do not get your phone out when the metro doors are open, the oldest theft trick is to snatch your phone just as the doors are about to close.
* Don't be ashamed of wrestling your way into that bus, it's all part of that exotic Transtu experience.

Pricing:

* Every corner shop likes to add 50 millimes or 100 on consumables especially on 1tnd phone cards.

2 ) Like inside the country ? Probably no . Plus hearing a "" cyka blyat "" joke almost on a daily basis while in high school is quite boring . 

3 ) Haven't been to Hammemet or Sousse for ages but me and the family went to Djerba a year or two ago . It was still full of them .

The only interaction I had was when it was time for dinner and everyone was basically looking for a good spot in the hotel's restaurant so I sat at this table looking in the direction of the sea but could feel it was a bit weird that literally no one took the spot before me . Seconds later there's a woman angrily telling me that she marked that place for her family by a sheet of paper that wasn't fucking there by the time I came .

The French protectorate of Tunisia (French: Protectorat français de Tunisie; Arabic: الحماية الفرنسية في تونس‎ al-Ḥimāya al-Fransīya fī Tūnis)  was established in 1881, during the French colonial Empire era, and lasted until Tunisian independence in 1956.

Tunisia formed a province of the decaying Ottoman Empire but enjoyed a large measure of autonomy under the bey Muhammad III as-Sadiq. In 1877, Russia declared war on the Ottoman Empire. Russian victory foreshadowed the dismemberment of the empire, including independence for several Balkan possessions and international discussions about the future of the North African provinces.

e7cae40,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/9m3hdc/,3,"The local market here in Tunisia is small. There are not enough clients for companies that work in engineering so  they have to find clients abroad. And this is the problem. Most of the engineers being talked about here are software majors, and if you are one you will know that there are two deep issues with this:

1- The types of jobs we have here are ones that companies abroad are willing to outsource. You are not going to be working on the really meaty and interesting parts. The job you will be doing won't really give you a great experience and you will find yourself after a few years experienced in subjects that are not really essential to the market, or that are outright not marketable. This is bad from a career standpoint.

2- You will be paid in dinar for services rendered and billed by your employer in Euro/Dollar/whatever more interesting currency. IT companies in Tunisia seem to have a consensus on how much to pay their engineers and most don't want to pay over market, which is low in comparison to what they make. Very low actually. So, as an engineer you will end up without a doubt thinking about cutting the middle man and making that sweet sweet bank. I know people that went to France with next to no experience and are now making 37k €. That's not much by France's standards, but they can expect that number to increase substantially in the next few years. Not to mention that they have a wide range of functional alternatives to choose from once their work permit is renewed.",2018-10-07 17:08:18

Vous êtes en train de confondre des concepts aussi basiques que distincts, notamment le colonialisme, l'adoption des technologies, et le néocolonialisme.

Le papier a été inventé en Chine au 2ème siècle. Comme technologie révolutionnaire il s'est aussitôt répandu rapidement dans le monde. Est ce que l'utilisation du papier à travers le monde est un signe de colonialisme chinois? C'est exactement ce que vous êtes en train de dire avec ""Youtube, Netflix, Google, tout ça c'est aussi de la colonisation"". Non, la colonisation et l'adoption des technologies sont deux choses complétement différentes.

Vous pouvez consulter wikipédia pour voir ce que c'est la colonisation [ici](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonisation). Pour le cas tunisien qui nous concerne, on a été colonisés par les français de 1881 à 1956. Le fait que nous sommes francophones en résulte. La colonisation est un drame humain et une injustice, les effets duquel nous en souffrons encore (en compagnie du reste du [global south](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_South) ).

Toutes les formes d'impérialisme culturel auxquels vous insinuez vaguement seraient mieux définis sous le concept du [néocolonialisme](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%A9ocolonialisme).
Ta réplique est myope et situe le problème dans une opposition entre la francophonie et l'anglophonie ou le monde anglo-saxon et la France. On devrait plutôt commencer par décoloniser nos esprits et arrêter d'intérioriser des jugements de valeur subjectifs, et qui sont souvent hérités du colonialisme.

This first committee of the long name contained elements from parties, associations and other civil society elements that - miraculously I might add - were able to sit down and agree on the elections and how the rules should look like. I think the reason they were able to agree was perhaps they trusted the guy who was the head of this committee. Or, I don't have much faith in this theory, but maybe they were for a brief moment actually patriotic. Who knows? But I do remember there was the question of one party or another dominating the discussion by having members join the committee in their capacity as members of organizations.

I don't think we are going to be able to pull this off again, so I hope we don't have to go through it anymore.",2018-03-05 18:29:26

dvb919h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/7tvdtb/,2,"The problem with our historical narrative is that it was really highjacked by the regime historian propagandists who needed a narrative that serves Bourguiba's foreign policy. He wanted to build a nation that is proud and non aligned, neither with the socialist/communist pan arabs (jamel abdennasser), islamists or the west. Didon fled Lebanon and severed all ties and we're a nation whose center is in Carthago, where he built his own presidential palace. 

The pan arabs and islamists reject the borders, imposed by the west according to them. Libya and Algeria were fighting their own demons and building their own nations. Gaddafi wanted a union. The beys identified with the ottomans. Bourguiba had to build a national identity from scratch by distancing himself from all of them. This was his way of protecting the tunisians from the problems outside and fostering their national pride.

It was a historical necessity back then and a good thing to do. We can today be more **neutral** and appeased in dealing with our heritage/history, instead of weaponizing it to legitimate political desires.

ETA: You wrote that we consider the romans as the enemy. Indeed, the romans destroyed Carthago and colonized it. The frensh colonialists' rhetoric is that they built schools and brought civilization (not colonization). The post colonial Tunisia had to distance itself from the ""colonialist civilizational efforts"" as well. Again, we're a self sufficient proud nation on its own. It was all linked to the fact that a new country had to build its own national identity. I hope this answers your question.",2018-03-07 08:18:35

dvjg2vm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/83p02i/,2,"Some misguided, confused Tunisian women (and men) are marching for ""equal"" inheritance.

This is what one protestor said:

""It is true that Tunisian women have more rights compared to other Arab women but we want to be compared with European women.""

Look at the colonized mind on display here. It just boggles *my* mind how blind these people are.

Then here is another quote:

""The [current] inheritance law is a significant barrier for women. It reduces their economic autonomy. Only 12 percent (of Tunisian women) own a house and only 14 percent own land. This impacts the access to women for property and credit.""

If women want equal inheritance and equal home ownership rates, then they should also be expected to give up their right to nafaqa, i.e., financial maintenance that the Sharia requires of husbands.

Rather than look at homeownership and land ownership differentials between the sexes, how about we consider the percentage of women who maintain men. What percentage of wives fully provide for their husbands and are fully responsible for all household financial responsibilities in Tunisia? I guarantee the number is far less than 12%. Why aren't there marches for that?

There is a powerful social and religious expectation that men provide for their wives and their families. And that's a great thing. That's what it means to be a man. There is no analogous expectation or sense of duty and honor for women, nor should there be. And that's why even in the ""liberated"" West, husbands still bear the vast majority of financial responsibilities, whereas virtually zero women are fully responsible for their families with no contribution from the men of the household.

Islamic law creates the perfect balance between the rights and responsibilities of the sexes. This balance is premised on the differences inherent to the sexes and their respective strengths and desires. Men have a unique place as leaders of their families and society and this deeply ingrained order that Allah has created will not be undermined by a ragtag group of wacky protestors or gender studies graduates.",2018-03-11 19:36:38

Yes indeed, just let's bury our heads under the soil like all other arab countries in order not to see our flaws, things are definitely going to be better this way.

Unemployment figures \(12&amp;#37; before, 16&amp;#37; now\) and economic growth figures \(4&amp;#37; under Ben Ali, 2&amp;#37; now\) are ridiculous compared to before but everything's okay.

Walking #MouchBessif for freedom of conscience

The association ""Free Freethinkers"" and the #Fater committee for the defense of the freedom of non\-fasting to lead a normal life guaranteed by the constitution organize Sunday , May 27, June 11 a sit in front of the tourist office at 14h to denounce the numerous arrests, closing of cafes and practices towards those who do not do Ramadan.

The #Fater collective was founded in 2013 as a group to share tips for finding a café or restaurant open during the month of Ramadan for those who do not fast for various reasons.

Although the Tunisian law and the constitution guarantee the personal rights to the conscience and do not forbid the opening of the cafes according to the sayings of the ministry of the interior, they also spend a bad time between random closures and visits of preachers without any legal basis.

The bilingual Law system in Tunisia makes it possible to study Law in French (although the official translation from Arabic to French takes a few weeks to month for some laws, they still are all available on French.)

State exams are in Arabic but that is if you plan on practising in Tunisia.

&gt; why would you study the law of Germany in Yiddish if the courts are in German?

Because it turns out there is a demand for Yiddish-speaking lawyers (or consultants if you don't want to pass the bar exam) in Germany Or if you plan on studying throughout the world to learn about different law systems in place.

LOL. I disagree, Islam is not like communism. And Islam has worked many times before to govern a state. 

&gt;It just doesn't, Islam is directly against democracy and liberty

What do you mean by ""democracy"" and ""liberty""? and please show me proof of this claim after you explain what those words mean? 

&gt;Muslims either want to go full Islamic state or everyone cherry picks according to their own beliefs which creates a vague state like ours. 

And what is wrong with ***Muslims in Muslim countries wanting their country to be ruled by Islam?*** 

IF the majority of Muslims in Tunisia or other Muslim countries want to have an Islamic government then that's their right and there's nothing wrong with it. And you still don't like it EVEN when people cherry pick according to their own beliefs? that's what many Muslims living in Muslim countries do. And how does that make Tunisia a ""vague state""?  

&gt;Imo if we want to improve, we make Tunisia secular

So do you want Tunisia to have a secular system like the one in France where Muslim women are banned from wearing hijab in public schools? 

&gt;those who are not Muslim can eat in public

What the heck are you talking about? people who are not Muslim CAN eat in public in Muslim countries,

Nida isn't a democratic party; they don't have institutions and all the party officials are basically self-proclaimed. They were not voted in. Chahed wants legitimacy somehow so that he can get that sweet sweet party leadership. And since he is a new comer, and his daddy isn't the president, and there are no party elections to be announced in the near future, he's looking for a new way: through his position as PM.

If he really wanted to help the country he would have come out and said Nida Tounes are becoming too encroached in the inner workings of the government and state, and should be stopped. But when he tells me Nida Tounes is facing hard times, what am I supposed to do with that information? Do you think the people will take to the streets to support him because of this one 11 minute speech? Even he doesn't believe that! He is staying as a PM because Ennahdha wants him there, regardless whether his party want him or not. So he is safe. He now thinks he has room to maneuver and make a move inside his party.

TLDR: No popular support needed, Ennahdha has his back until 2019's general elections =&gt; He can promote whoever he wants ( or refuse to ) =&gt; His speech is for personal gain.",2018-05-31 07:38:18
dzvin12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/8nbr7t/,2,"&gt; On what grounds do you say that?

Monday there was a meeting of the Carthage Document signatories, organized by the president. The question of whether Chahed should be fired or not was discussed, with Nida and UGTT supporting kicking him, and Ennahdha against it. Ghanouchi said the PM should remain because there have been too many government changes and this is affecting the financial standing of the country with foreign institutions. Abdelkrim El Harouni also stated something in this vein, and said that . Ghanouchi invited those who don't like the PM to take the matter to the Assembly.
[Here](https://www.facebook.com/Nahda.Tunisia/videos/1965873533436763/) and [Here](https://www.facebook.com/Nahda.Tunisia/videos/1965747756782674/).

So Ennahdha is backing Chahed.

&gt; He announced countless times that he will not try to be elected as president.

He's a politician, politicians see alternative truths.

&gt;  what are ""his personal gains""?

There may be more than one thing to gain from pushing away HKS. For example the party chairman position is up for grabs technically. ",2018-05-31 11:51:39

Also, touristic areas are ripe with thieves so watch your pockets and stuff.  If you want to buy stuff, have your Tunisian friend speak on your behalf and always haggle on prices if you're buying trinkets.  Always.

This new report by the committee includes many controversial points that the public has very belligerent ideas about.

Instead, the committee, which is composed of elected people, decided it would be best if a bunch of sweeping reforms were bundled together. The heated discussion that ensued from this seems very well timed as the government plans price hikes.

Although the relationship between the two is not obvious.

Homosexuals represent 4&amp;#37; of the population (referring to European/NA data).

This law means that :

\- Homosexuals in Tunisia will be more productive (less scared of the state)

\- Less productive people in prisons (yes there are many people in Jail that are perfectly productive citizens that cost us money (jail) instead of working)

\- A lot of homosexual tunisians flee Tunisia for fear of getting caught (usually to Europe).

More often that not, those are educated people who end up enriching Europe rather than Tunisia.

\- Homosexual Tourists will be able to come to Tunisia without fearing for their lives. This might (albeit slightly) increase Tunisia's attractiveness. (Mykonos, an Island in Greece got rich thanks to homosexual tourists because it was the first greek Island to welcome them)

Citizenship isn't required to own property. What I am trying to work out at the moment is if it is at all possible for a foreign man to get Tunisian citizenship. I was told just today about a Swiss couple living in Tunisia for 3 decades with a daughter who married a Tunisian guy who have still not been given citizenship. This, for me, is confusing. I have also yet to see a European man with a Tunisian passport.

Bring your own lunch because you'll want to spend all day there
Kelibia is great this time of year. The atmosphere is relaxed but the city is alive every night, stay in downtown kelibia for a few days and go explore the area during the day, wine tasting at local vineyards and beautiful hikes to Roman Ruins, you can hire a boat to take you to some great spots along the cost out of el haouaria. Kelibia's a great home base for all of cap bon, I would rather stay in town though it's boring at night if you stay too far from the hub of things.
Another great place is the area around Tabarka.
I don't like tourist stuff usually so I would rather find the best places to visit in this beautiful country that are a bit more back to nature.
I wouldn't recommend going to the south at this time of year it is mighty hot!

* French (not Tunisian dual citizen) travelling on a regular flight: need a passport

* French-Tunisian: Need the Tunisian passport. Even more complication if minor

This is for French alone. Source below. It is actually the Interior ministry that should have these rules, the one overseeing the Police. Neither of the one you mention, have made the rules.

Besides I'm most of the time seen as local by people here while in Russia they tend to think I'm a foreigner .

I was born and raised in Tunisia but I never really felt like ... any other person around me since both of my parents had equal influences on literally everything in my life which resulted in a quite complicated/weird situation surrounding some stuff . ( IMHO I'm glad to have such roots but fuck man it's tough ) Exemples ? Language : Until I was 6 ( more specifically until the day I entered primary school ) I didn't really talk to anyone except my family and basically spoke 3 languages in a non perfect way . The best one being French as I spent every day in front of the TV watching series and cartoons in that language ( Ah Code lyoko / M6 / that witches series on M6 I forgot the name of , nostalgia ) Now I also have English and German added to my collection and frankly speaking **it's fucking hard to keep a decent level on all of them** . My Arabic language skills are so low I got 1/20 two years ago on my final exam ( no joke ) . French is literally going down like Titanic while my Russian is ... let's say I sound like one of those tajiiks working illegally in Moscow. Religion : Now this is something even more weird as I can't choose between being a Christian or Muslim and legit considered being both . Back until I was like 12 I used to go to both the church and Mosque . Heck I remember going to both on the same day sometimes . I don't feel like going full atheist but I can't choose between these two either . Minor cons : I hate that freaking '' Muh where are u from mate xd ? "" As I'm forced to pick one country in order to avoid a long AF conversation regarding my Identity . + Let's not forget those daily cyka blyat , OP Putin xd jokes .

it definitely made me an open minded person that tends to look for answers to different questions most Tunisians don't bother to even think of . I'd say it's a positive impact .",2018-08-07 20:43:50
e3sekoq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/93i635/,2,"""Freest"" isn't Free.

The United States is one of the freest Countries in the world to allow you to express yourself in but that doesn't mean you won't face backlash if you are famous/popular and do something risque.  Miley Cyrus caught a lot of shit for appearing nude (no body parts seen mind you) on a cannonball.  Simulated sex scenes by performers are seen as risque too and people will still catch crap for it in the US.

I, someone who isn't Tunisian mind you, think people should mind their own business.  Tunisia (and pretty much any country) have so much going on with it that what a woman decides to do in her free time is not going to crack the top 250 list of things that are important.  Especially in Tunisia where we have water cut off for days because a main pipe broke.  Or blackouts across the country because people are using their A/C too much.  Roads that are in such disrepair I'm beginning to think it's a conspiracy but car repair people to create more business.

Tunisia has a lot of needs and things to fix and this is just a distraction.  It sounds like this is a family issue to deal with and Tunisia, regardless of if it likes it or not, will be drug into the 21st century.  The old guard will eventually die off but you will always have conservatives here.  People who think Religion is the way to rule.  They'll go down in numbers over time and more and more freedoms will come with that.  It's a growing process and Tunisia will grow.",2018-08-07 21:50:18

Hah! He is a [particularly misogynist person](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2e8KGCmDKI) actually. And whatever you perceive as things he made for women isn't anything that out of the ordinary from someone slightly to the left of Ennahdha in the political spectrum. Just talking points to defend a very meager harvest after 4 years in power from someone who literally said he has enough people to run 4 governments.

&gt; 1) He isn't responsible for the attacks ...

1) Refer to number 3 hereunder

&gt; 2) The head of government is the one who holds the power and should be the most accountable for it.

2) Oh no he isn't. I will remind you that Nidaa in 2014 won both legislative and presidential elections, all behind the name of BCE. He had a comfortable position to choose whoever he wanted as PM and to remove them from their office whenever he wished. And he did. As a matter of fact he did remove a PM, which helped his political prospects and hurt the economy in the process. It is his responsibility to get a guy who can assemble a good team to run the country.

&gt; 3) managed to become the laughing stick of the common  

3) Here's where all you said above actually applies to Marzouki. He literally took office in 2011 right after the revolution, and he actually had no powers neither on paper nor de facto. How come you give BCE's government a break from the same thing that got Marzouki beaten? And the security situation is improving now because of measures that started when Marzouki was ""president"", it didn't come all of a sudden in a puff of smoke.

I was curious whether Tunisia had one or not.  As I expected it didn't.  It pissed me off even more after doing some digging on the internet and I couldn't find anything on several websites that offer these type of help lines.

Coming from the UAE I've experienced blazing fast internet speeds and here in Tunis it's just fine. My advice to you if you aren't wanting to stay for too long here. Is to get a USB modem from any one of the big providers, they do have a set data cap but have times of day where they give you unlimited 4G internet. They're relatively inexpensive to buy and maintain as long as you're not burning through your data like crazy. This solution won't tie you down to any one place such as your home or a cafe, alternatively you can just use your phone and share the connection, but that will drain your battery and the speed and connection quality fluctuates a lot more in my experience.

And if you're looking into co-working spaces, there are now a wide variety of places to head to. Cogite in Lac 1 is by far the largest and most accomplished one in the city, however I prefer Level 1 as it provides a much more tech focused atmosphere and some snacks :P 

There are some great co-working spaces in Marsa on the beach. One I've been to is Tunis - Tech Villa, which is a chill place to sit down and work in a small cosy villa about 2 mins away from the beach. 

Edit: If consistency is your main issue and you would like  unlimited at home internet then I suggest Ooredoo's ""Fixe Jdid"" it doesn't require your home to have a telephone line either so it's great for those renting an apartment that does not have a phone line installed.",2018-08-18 11:28:42

Third people don't need a tech rev they need food and knowledge. It would be far more beneficial to invest in education than technology. Moreover we still don't have the right to produce anything without the approval of the countries we owe money to.

I didnt say that we would do it. I said that it will happen everywhere in the world.

Once self driving car starts getting produced on a global scale, the tunisian market will follow. Same thing for everything that's automated. =&gt; huge unemployment and many other things

At that moment, we will have to implement policies to deal with it. And I think that ennahda wont be progressive enough to implement the right policies. Suppose for instance that we spend time looking at the issue from a quranic pov? And use the Quran to implement the ""right policies""? That would be ridiculous.

&gt;I don't mind living in a country like Iran if it provides me with a good education, good health insurance and a good job. It will take a long time for us to become to develop, because we just don't focus on the real issues of our nation.

Iran has passed a law to allow its citizens to [legally sell their kidney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_trade_in_Iran). This tells a lot about how well the economics/health of the country fares.

&gt;It will take a long time for us to become to develop, because we just don't focus on the real issues of our nation.

I wouldnt put the blame on that.... Do u think that other developed countries didnt go through a period similar to ours?

 Je m'explique, en Algérie, sans connaissance du français, on peut aller jusqu'ou dans le marché laborale? Et dans l'éducation?

When the value of the rouble drops to almost 100 per euro, you buy the same car for 1,500,000 Roubles - which you in turn buy for 15,000€ - thus you buy the car for half price due to the play with currency.

If I buy an investment property for 100,000€ now in Tunisia (paying in TND) and the value of the TND doubles, then when I sell it, I'll be selling it for the equivalent of 200,000€. Easy way of doubling money.

Anyway, if we were to think purely pragmatically, not hindering the migrants' passage will benefit Tunisia. Aiding them in their passage will be even better, the sooner they are off our lands and in Europe the less costly it is for us. Plus the migrants will be better off there, they don't even want to be here. 

Imagine the amounts of resources we will have to put to support efforts to keep them south of the Mediterranean. I wonder what they would have offered us if we were not dealing with terrorism.

e6sy25r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/9jdno9/,2,"&gt; Ceci dit, il faut bien faire la différence entre un réfugié et un migrant économique.

C'est difficile. Beaucoup de migrants arrivent sans rien, même pas de papier, donc comment prouver qu'ils fuient une menace ou simplement la misère?

&gt;  Les deux demanderont asile, signeront les mêmes papiers une fois arrivés

S'ils y parviennent. Une fois qu'ils ont fait une demande d'asile, ils ont légalement le droit de rester, et le pays dans lequel ils font la demande est oblige de traiter la demande. Pour éviter ça, les pays Européens font tout ce qu'ils peuvent pour rendre la procédure difficile, ou carrément la décourager, comme en Hongrie ou les demandeur d'asile sont emprisonnes dans des camps dans des conditions plus que limites le temps que leur demande soit traitée.

&gt;  le premier sera normalement accueilli à bras ouvert en France ou ailleurs en UE

Ça c'est la théorie. En pratique beaucoup sont emprisonnes, renvoyés dans leur pays car leur statut n'est pas reconnu, ou parce qu'il n'ont pas pu faire de demande d'asile en bonne et due forme comme la loi les y autorise pourtant. Enfin, même quand ils sont légalement acceptes, une grande partie de la population les rejette. J’appellerais pas ça un accueil a bras ouverts, loin s'en faut.

&gt; Imagine si tout le monde qui galère financièrement dans son pays se mettait à venir en Europe pour trouver un meilleur travail... 

Même si c’était légalement possible beaucoup ne le feraient pas, pour tout un tas de raison (pas les moyens, attachement familial, pas envie de quitter leur pays, etc.). Par ailleurs, l'UE c'est ~7% de la population mondiale pour ~22% du PIB en 2017. Il y a des ressources, il faut juste accepter de les partager plus équitablement.",2018-09-28 16:13:18

I think, the real monetary value that Tunisia gains from the brain drain is the investments made by tunisian citizens abroad on tunisian soil, as they usually have a better ability to invest than the locals (a relatively higher pay + a stronger currency). 
The situation is intricate however, as some claim that the value that is lost due to the departure of highly qualified individuals is greater than the value of the investments made by some of them here (which makes sense), but also some argue that there is no platform nor infrastructure that is developed enough to host those individuals, or at least a big amount of them.

e8ha318,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/9ric3v/,2,"I appreciate your comment. I know the safety question is always a bit of a challenging question to ask as I have been to plenty of places that people were scared for me to visit and I found this amazing and free of any issues. Plus, as an American from a city with plenty of crime, sadly, I have found most places to have a safer feeling than many places in my hometown. 

I guess Tunisia gives me pause due to the very limited posts about recent travel there combined with the fact it seems I would be going at a lower tourist time of year as it isn't beach season, in an overall low tourist country. I generally prefer to travel to places during not busy times, so that isn't necessarily a deterrent but given I only speak English definitely adds to my concern of how challenging it might be. 

I'm currently in Ramallah in West Bank, Palestine so somewhere being low of tourism in and of itself definitely doesn't phase me. But when you are a women traveling solo you do have to do your due diligence.",2018-10-26 09:22:58
e8haejq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/9ric3v/,2,"&gt;But when you are a women traveling solo you do have to do your due diligence.

I totally agree. The opinion that I can give you is that in general travelling and staying here is perfectly safe and fine. I can't honestly give you any specific information about being a solo female or a solo tourist in the off season but honestly I can guess (from actually living and interacting with all sorts of people here unlike u/Kurkpitten) is that it will be totally normal. 

We are a very western country (I would go as far as the most western-like Arabic country) and you will probably get that feeling as soon as you touch down in the capital or the coastal cities (inner cities are a bit more arabic/hardcore muslim than western). 

You'll probably get catcalled a few times or get some dude asking for your number but honestly that will happen in any country basically. We do however like to flex our English once we figure out that someone is from an English country so get used to old people talking to you in broken English and a funny accent.",2018-10-26 09:34:00

religion is one of the great limiters of moral identity, since most 
believers differentiate themselves, in moral terms, from those who do 
not share their faith. No other ideology is so eloquent on the subject 
of what divides one moral community from another. Once a person 
accepts the premises upon which most religious identities are built,
the withdrawal of his moral concern from those who do not share 
these premises follows quite naturally. Needless to say, the suffering 
of those who are destined for hell can never be as problematic as the 
suffering of the righteous. If certain people can't see the unique wis-
dom and sanctity of my religion, if their hearts are so beclouded by 
sin, what concern is it of mine if others mistreat them? They have

In social animals (all mammals and a few reptiles...), you can't survive on your own so if you don't have empathy and act according to the good of the tribe, you'll get ostracized and your asshole genes won't reproduce. Only those who have a good set of morals and of common sense would survive and reproduce the same genes. We are basically selected to be good by hundreds of thousands of years of evolution (and of course, nature is not perfect and it will produce exceptions).    


If you're a cat, your genes are not that complicated and there's no big risk of congenital diseases in your babies if you fuck your mother; so even if you are attracted to your relatives, it doesn't matter and there's no selection against that. In great apes however, this becomes problemetic, and those who spend their reproductive energy away from their relatives (aka: they're disgusted by incest and they're way more attracted to strangers), will produce healthier babies who have the same attraction mechanisms. Those who are attracted to their relatives won't be able to compete in the gene pool and they got wiped out. Yes, orangutans and chimps also approve disgust in incest and they very rarely indulge in it - just like humans. And yes, that's why muslims think they're better because they have a law against incest. This actually proves that they are already disgusted by the idea from the beginning and they liked islam because it had that ""genius idea"".  


When we are kids, we want to be good. They tell us : religion will make you good; so we embrace it. It's actually our inner morals that make us want to choose religion, not the other way around. Religion needs our inner morals to exist, not the other way around. And then, it hijacks our moral system to make us commit atrocities. Don't steal...ok, don't kill...ok, don't fuck your mother...weird flex but ok, don't eat human cadavers...oO""...kill and cut infidels and take slaves... wow cool I'm so moral now.  


You'll be almost the same, with religion or without. You're most likely acting by the way your personality is built and you think that religion is the explanation. It rarely is, and when it is the explanation, you'll find yourself doing some weird immoral shit that you're better off of it.  


Btw, Hitler was very catholic. Also, every atheist has his own personality and beliefs. Atheism is not a belief in itself that you can judge it by the acts of one atheist. You can do that to any religion, but not to atheism as it's not a religion with shared beliefs. It is the absence of a shared belief. If Atheism is a religion or a set of beliefs, then people who don't play soccer are a soccer team. This stupid, but it's hard to imagine if you only think inside of the box. Atheists are free of that box and can form whatever beliefs they like. For example, I personally don't drink as i consider it bad to my mental and physical health and I think that there are deeper and better social discussions that can happen with a sharp mind if people leave out the possibility of getting drunk to socialize. I don't mind a piece of bacon or two as I love high fat and protein food.

4. Good choices. El Jem is amazing.

5. You can do Sousse to Kairouan via bus.

There is no dedicated website for carpooling in tunisia yet, so your best way to find some is on fb groups. Just type ""Tunis - *Destination* covoiturage"". Here's [one for Bizerte-Tunis for exemple.](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1676607292572666/)

Perhaps students would not be interested in who said what and where (Harmer, who wrote ""how to teach english"" said..).. Maybe you should say sth in these lines (Harmer, a reputed linguist said xyz)
2. Grade your language, it seems that the level of your audience should be for high levels, while your tips are for very low levels too... Simplify your message
3. Write what you re saying in subtitles. This would help your learners to follow you, pause to look up the word they dont know, practice the pronunciation of that word, rewind and listen you what you were saying again to know how to use it)
4. Use more visuals about what you re talking about, maybe cartoons to make the message easier to understand and memorable (both are your aim in this kind of videos)
5. This is related to point 2, slow down when you re talking, dont forget our learners are scared of listening because they think ppl speak fast
6. If you re aiming the maghreb audience, greet them by naming their countries, give examples from their countries (from your experience in class ( in Algiers in this case) and from what they write in their comments)
7. Ask your audience to give you their opinion abt a question you ask in your video ( this can give some material to the next video you want to make)

If you have any question regarding anything above or an idea, dont hesitate to drop me a line :)

Many cultural events (and one local TV station) were named with Carthaginian names just for the heck of it, and I have one regime propaganda book (written by one of its servant intellectuals) that basically says that Ben Ali is the New Hannibal and that he will restore the former glory of Carthage.

However, that didn't take off, except in the former regime supporters nowadays. They don't emphasize it much but it's there if you watch their discourse more closely (they do the ""we're also muslims so you don't have the right to claim you're promoting and defending Islam"" more, to try and counter Islamists, even if their views are extremly liberal, they're atheists/agnostic/non-practising, or their Islamic knowledge is otherwise very shallow)",2018-02-17 23:41:56

Not only their French level, but also their English level is regressing, and we in Tunisia we all know we have this problem as well (if you can't see how we inherited it from them), and that the level in our students in English is degrading (most Tunisian STEM students in public universities ditch all English courses altogether. Yes. The End Result of our glorious system...). 

=
The only correct answer is to improve the Language Education we already have (if we can't change what is being taught), but because the French Education system we have (and all of the Tunisian environment really) prioritizes French over anything else overall, our students grow weaker in Arabic, then their attitude remains and ruins all the other language courses. If there's a language that most people would care about if at all, it would be their (supposed) native language, and without instilling a pride into students when they get proficient in their own mother tongue, you won't force the majority into caring about languages at all. We, in Tunisia however, we got very good at mocking those who speak Modern Standard Arabic very well. Some people at the top contribute to the top. And that's why nothing will never change for now.

Now who fills those seats? Before the election happens, the party will create a list by some means of their favoured candidates in the order they want to get in parliament. 

There are many ways of filling that list. It could have the party members approving yes or no to each candidate on the list, it could be a party commission, often the party will put say 40% of the seats women, 40% men, and the remainder is up to the party to decide independently, or in a corrupt system, it could be the party leaders putting them on the list in order of how much they serve the party leaders, if they support key bills giving the leader a mansion, or something of that sort.

dva95t3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/81ydlf/,1,"It depends on the party. Some parties have institutions that decide this. Others have had the same leadership for literally decades.

But this is a very large party, with a long history of activity under oppression and in exile. It's an exception, and definitely not a rule.

When the elections for the parliament, or - as is currently being prepared -  the municipalities come, the Tunisians will be asked to vote for these lists, which by law must contain 50% men and 50% women. The elections are made so that even in a region that has a predominant party, even other parties can still have representatives. So 20% of the votes is not 20% of the seats. ",2018-03-06 20:31:54

What kind of nationalism are you talking about? The one where its own leaders don't care about the country nor even its damn borders and sovereignty to begin with, but they want to fool and force everyone else to care so that the country doesn't fall in one day and so that they can continue to hoard it, steal it, give parts of it away to the West in exchange for bribes, but not unite with other similar countries and expand it because it endangers their totalitarian rule over the little farm they call a ""country"" in public? Give me a rest already.

=
A union between countries like the EU, or a federalized union between all Arab states like the USA isn't antithetical to Nationalism, nor to Islam (Italian Nationalism for example unified Italy). Each one still gets to keep its identity and a bit of sovereignty (without fucking others with themselves).

Call it a Caliphate, call it something else, it doesn't matter. But we all know that the ""people who don't like how religions works"" either failed to do it or are fundamentally against it. Since they tend to converge towards ""necessary dictatorships to fight Political Islam/Terrorism/theywontdifferentiate, and to enforce the changes they want from above"" since Democracy = accepting Political Islam as a contender, and that dictatorships don't prefer peaceful unions with their neighbors but brute force instead.

So yeah, I say the ""people who don't like how religions works"" should preferably stand aside and meditate/contemplate/limitfuckingthemselvestoonlytheirownhouses, until the ""people who are OK with how religions works"" fix what they broke, and perhaps by then they can figure out by themselves where they went wong? /r/hmmm ",2018-03-23 20:32:35

Especially since the 2014 constitution it is completely legal to believe in whatever you want (or lack thereof), change religion ect... there is no control in those fields.

Generally speaking, Tunisians see things as a matter of respect, so you can do whatever you want as long as you respect people around you and this for both religious or non religious people. 

There are enforced legal sentences for menacing people, harassment based on religion ect... for instance, while this is also true for publicly defiling certain symbols. However in neither cases would that go to long emprisonment or death (not enforced since the 1960s btw and anyway not for this kind of petty crimes), they are mostly fines or conditional sentences.",2018-04-19 09:46:26

The term ""Moors"" refers primarily to the Muslim inhabitants of the Maghreb, the Iberian Peninsula, Sicily, and Malta during the Middle Ages. The Moors initially were the Berber autochthones of the Maghreb. The name was later also applied to Arabs.

Moors are not a distinct or self-defined people, and the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica observed that ""The term 'Moors' has no real ethnological value."" Medieval and early modern Europeans variously applied the name to Arabs, North African Berbers, and Muslim Europeans.

Alors accroissez ma science: quelle  "" presque moitié "" du pays comme vous dites l'Algérie vous aurait elle "" volée "" ? Est ce dans le Nord, est ce dans le désert ?  Est ce par rapport à l'époque ottomane ou par rapport à Carthage?

 D'un côté, dois je vous rappeler la sacro-sainte intangibilité des frontières héritées de la colonisation ? De l'autre, vous n'êtes pas sans savoir que les Algériens ont mené une guerre de 7 ans pour libérer leur territoire colonisé au contraire de la Tunisie qui a obtenu son indépendance justement parce que la France préférait se concentrer sur l'Algérie. Par conséquent ce qui a été acquis à la pointe du fusil pendant la guerre contre la France l'est pour toujours.

Vous êtes le deuxième voisin de l'Est sur ce site à révéler des tendances sordides envers les Algériens, je vais finir par croire que chez vous c'est une constante nationale.

En attendant, voici pour vous rafraichir la mémoire:

   Mon pauvre monsieur, vous vous rendez malade pour rien. La haine est contre-productive.


  Les Algériens de l'Est sont des descendants du royaume numide puis du royaume numido-romain, des Chaouis purs et durs, rien à voir avec Carthage.

dy6dwdi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/8ew8q5/,1,"L'Algérie ne cherche pas à s'attribuer le Sahara Occidental, d'où vous vient cette idée sotte et grenue ? Vous pouvez dire ce que vous voulez concernant son soutien au Polisario et à propos de Tindouf et Béchar mais pas celui de convoiter un territoire supplémentaire, même les marocains ne le disent pas;  ce qu'ils disent c'est que l'Algérie veut un couloir sur l'Atlantique. Or c'est une proposition qui lui a été faite à l'époque par la Mauritanie et que l'Algérie a déclinée en avançant qu'elle ne prendrait pas un territoire qui ne lui appartenait pas.

 Pour évacuer du gaz vers l'Europe il existe déjà un gazoduc dirigé vers l'Espagne en passant par le Nord du Maroc; l'évacuation de quoi que ce soit d'autre par le Maroc n'aurait donc posé aucun problème car bien entendu qui dit passage dit royalties. On a vendu aux USA du gaz liquéfié livré par méthaniers à partir d’Algérie car je ne vois pas comment on aurait pu faire autrement: un immense gazoduc creusé sous l'Océan pour un contrat prévu pour vingt ans ?   

La Méditerranée est plus proche de tous les pays d'Europe et de l'Orient, pourquoi l'Algérie et ses 1600 km de côtes les plus longues de tous les pays de la région rêverait t'elle de l'Atlantique coincée à l'extrémité du continent ?  Quant à l'évacuation du fer de Gara Djébilet, ce n'était pas à l'ordre du jour en 1975. Ce n'est que maintenant en 2018 quarante ans plus tard que l'on songe à son exploitation. Et comme en Algérie il y a des aciéries, elle n'a aucune raison de vendre son fer à l'état brut et encore une fois pour le vendre à qui, aux sardines de l'Atlantique ? Les acheteurs sont en Europe et en Asie, pas en Amérique. 


Voilà, il faut se renseigner avant de reprendre la propagande primaire destinée à enfumer les populations ou bien simplement ne serait ce qu'exercer son bon sens. 

Quand je parle de gratitude, cela ne veut pas dire tresser des couronnes à qui de droit, cela veut simplement dire s'abstenir de balancer des méchancetés gratuites sur un pays qui vous a sauvé la mise à plusieurs reprises. L'Algérie aide la Tunisie et plein d'autres pays africains sans conditions sans tambours ni trompettes, même pas un vote en sa faveur dans les assemblées internationales. En retour elle récolte toute la haine des medias et des ONG laquais de qui on sait. Parce que l'Algérie n'est pas un pays à la botte, voilà pourquoi. Mais ce n'est pas grave, on survivra.",2018-04-29 19:50:33
dy6l89l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/8ew8q5/,1,"  Çà tombe bien, on vient de livrer du ciment à la Gambie à partir d'Arzew et par bateau. A vue de nez, franchement le transport direct par bateau me semble bien plus pratique et pas beaucoup plus long qu'une laborieuse et aventureuse traversée en camions ( et il faut voir combien de camions pour transporter des centaines de tonnes de marchandises ) à travers tout le désert algérien puis le Sahara occidental suivie d'un transport par bateau disons El Aayoune-Gambie. Pour les pays du Sahel, on a une voie en droite ligne, la Transsaharienne justement prévue pour le commerce inter-africain. La piste couloir vers l'Atlantique n'a donc aucun intérêt. 



Si l'Algérie tirait un profit politique des pays qu'elle aide financièrement, militairement, humanitairement, accueil d' étudiants etc... ça se saurait. Bien au contraire, ce sont ces pays qui dans les assemblées internationales votent "" neutre"" sur la question sahraouie par exemple, si ce n'est pas contre l'Algérie et en faveur du Maroc, et la Tunisie n'y fait pas exception. Les diplomaties de l'Algérie et de la Tunisie n'agissent absolument pas de concert. Ce sont les pays qu'elle n'aide pas, des pays anglophones, qui sont le plus en harmonie avec la diplomatie algérienne sur cette même question sahraouie, étonnant, non ? Et quant à la Palestine n'en parlons pas, les pays africains n'en font qu'à leur tête. 


La méchanceté gratuite dont je vous accuse ? Et bien elle va dans le sens du souvenir que les Tunisiens ont laissé aux Algériens pendant la décennie noire: tout le monde ici se souvient de ces Tunisien( nes) interviewés par la télévision française France 2 sur la Tunisie ( pas une seule fois mais plusieurs ), et qui répondaient très agressivement, alors que ça n'avait rien à voir avec l'Algérie :"" Nous ne sommes pas des Algériens, nous, nous sommes des Tunisiens nous ne sommes pas des terroristes, nous, nous ne sommes pas des sauvages !"" 

Et bien je vous assure que le journaliste français qui leur tendait le micro en était tout éberlué.

When did it succeed to govern a first world state ?

&gt;What do you mean by ""democracy"" and ""liberty""? 

Use wikipedia.

&gt;and please show me proof of this claim after you explain what those words mean? 

Alright, here a couple on top of my head :

* 1 :

&gt;

    Six Tunisian students in Kairouan have been sentenced to three years of imprisonment and five years banishment from Kairouan on charges of homosexual activity. It is also understood that all six were subjected to an enforced rectal examination.

    One of the six received an additional six months for “violations of good morality”to his existing sentence for possession of computer video footage featuring homosexual acts, which breached Article 226 of Tunisia’s 1913 Penal Code.

    A gay Italian tourist, Angelo, was found murdered, stabbed repeatedly 10 times, in his holiday apartment in Hammamet, Tunisia. (1 August 2012)

* 2 :

&gt;

    2 young people less than 20years old had been kept by the police because they were kissing in a public area. The judge’s sentence was very strict: 2 months of jail for each of those two teenagers.

needless to say depending on how religious the parties are in the Parliament the sentencing could be more severe, we can't allow ourselves to be put on a religious watch, each person has his own interpretation of reality, i'm too lazy to mention the things going on in Iran or the ME.

In fact, just your reply makes me think you're delusional.

&gt;And what is wrong with Muslims in Muslim countries wanting their country to be ruled by Islam?

do you know what minority rights mean ?

&gt;And how does that make Tunisia a ""vague state""? 

Meaning it's laws change depending on the muslim party ruling it, for example [Al Nahdha](https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A9_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%87%D8%B6%D8%A9_(%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%86%D8%B3)), [Al Tahrir](https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%AD%D8%B2%D8%A8_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B1) and [harakat wafe](https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A9_%D9%88%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%A1_(%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%86%D8%B3)) are all Islamic political parties that have different Islamic views that they want to impose, this makes the state's position on things unclear thus vague.

&gt;So do you want Tunisia to have a secular system like the one in France where Muslim women are banned from wearing hijab in public schools? 

Yes.

&gt;What the heck are you talking about? people who are not Muslim CAN eat in public in Muslim countries

Umm.. No ?

&gt;Um not really.

These didn't seem like arguments as much as biased opinion, You can still fully practice your religion in a secular system, you just don't impose them on people anymore, that's really it.

They wont move to the streets to support him but if he is kicked out of Nida, I think that there will be some protests and Nida will lose many votes.

&gt;  He is staying as a PM because Ennahdha wants him there, regardless whether his party want him or not. So he is safe.

&gt; TLDR: No popular support needed, Ennahdha has his back until 2019's general elections 

On what grounds do you say that?

&gt; His speech is for personal gain.

Since he already claimed that he wont be part of the next elections, what are ""his personal gains""?

e022klq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/8nifks/,1,"Hey there, I would suggest definitely visiting Sidi Bou Said and the Bardo Museum--the museum is often rather empty it's really neat.  Sidi Bou Said, on the other hand, is jam-packed during and after Iftar, but it really is a beautiful place.

I also suggest visiting the Medina in the morning, wait too late and shops will close up (during Ramadan, at least, I can't say for other times of year).  A lot of vendors will try to sell you goods, you can politely refuse by saying ""non merci"" a few times and continuing to walk.  Zitouna Mosque is a place in the Medina that you should absolutely go in the morning--but dress modestly!  The Kasbah is near by, and that's worth checking out too.

For some advice, when taking a cab, be sure to look at the meter.  It should say ""1"" in the day and ""2"" at night--pointing at the meter a few times generally solves this.  Also be aware of prices because some vendors and restaurants like to charge a little more to tourists (I like to think of it as a ""tourist tax"")--if you point out the real price, you'll generally be ok.

Good luck, safe travels, and be sure to enjoy Tunis!  It's, hands down, the best place I've ever visited--and will continue to visit.",2018-06-03 20:36:52

you don t need people to meet and great guests. they just need the key to the apartment.

an agency would cost you more than an individual. you can try and talk to the security guard. you can give him something each time he takes care of giving the key and taking it back. maybe he can bring someone to clean the apartment after every guest.

I want a passive income, not capital appreciation in (whenever I sell it) years' time. I might never sell it.

And how does someone coming from France for a week give the person to the next occupant when the occupant will only arrive a week or so after the person is back in France? Someone needs to keep the key and know who to trust, and who not to trust with it.

a house costs more to rent than an apartment.

When the law says that you need to get permission from the local government, what is the actual spirit of the law? Is it to stop Chinese/Gulf businessmen from buying up flats/apartments that they will never set foot in, is it to stop European retirees from buying homes? What do I need to do to get approved, how much do I need to pay, and does the general ""he's a tourist so we want to make him feel comfortable and happy so as to improve Tunisia's image abroad"" apply?

How much are the bribes? $100,000 or $1000-2000, a percentage of the cost of the house?

&gt; building houses and not buying up apartments I'm willing to bet

I want a single apartment costing 90,000TND. The most I can pay (including government taxes and bribes) is 10% of that.

You can also try the bus or perhaps a taxi once you're off Djerba, but I am not sure if that would be reliable if it's you're first time there. Perhaps there are excursions also organised from Djerba if you are at an hotel, you could try checking on that.",2018-07-31 02:11:57

For example, there are many countries that aren't religious anymore but where you still need to be 18 to buy an issue of Playboy magazine. We know that the belief that sex is evil is religious in nature, but it's going to take a very long time before we can get used to the idea of a 12 year old boy buying a Playboy.

Similarly, many Asian countries traditionally think of dead bodies as ""impure"". It doesn't mean anything and the belief clearly comes from old superstition, but people raised within that culture will not be able to shake that impression off even if they're not religious or superstitious, and it takes particularly bold people to take up a job as a mortician/embalmer.

&gt; I was just asking the guy about Christianity 

No, you were making a blind assumption and a statement

This doesn't. I never said it did. I said that KSA-funded zealots (such as Zakir Naik, who, along with his son, is wanted for terrorism in India but is harbored by and has citizenship of Saudi Arabia) propagandate the popular-among-some-Muslims belief that Christians worship more than one supreme being. Ahmad Deedat was also a pawn that they used.

Both individuals, when making these statements, are acting against what the Quran and Hadeeth says about Christians (can provide sources upon request). The UAE, while allowing some churches, puts limits on the Christian faith and it's believers. No foreigner, other than one desperate for money, would move to the UAE - there is no culture or history behind this state, just artificial sand islets and sky-scrappers, and no prospect for gaining citizenship and becoming a part of the community. The lust towards money, as they say, is the root of all evil - I doubt many of your classmates know much about their religion.

Since the January 2011 revolution in Tunisia and protests across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) began, many Western news sources have published articles discussing the unprecedented role that Tunisian women played in the protests. Many of these articles highlight some of the secular freedoms instituted by Habib Bourguiba in 1956, such as access to higher education, the right to file for divorce, and certain job opportunities. While women in Tunisia have enjoyed certain freedoms and rights that are often denied to women in neighboring countries, the social norms have shifted since 2011. Additionally, even though some aspects of society were relatively liberal, the regime still classified itself as a Muslim people.

e4ab9h3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/97hk09/,1,"This is about the economy. The majority of university graduates are female, yet unemployment is higher among females than males. Which means the market is missing on a lot of skilled workers. And I think the fierce opposition to the Colibe illustrates why women are discouraged from pursuing a career. The workplace (as an extension of society) is ruthless to them and considers them lesser than men. So, more rights can translate into more female workers, which is good for the economy, especially if you consider how much the country invest in education. When it comes to the inheritance law in particular, higher education graduates are more likely to start their own business. Again, these are mostly females. Giving them equal inheritance rights will provide some of them with a little capital that might encourage them to consider starting their business. 
So yes, this is about the economy. Because economy is a social matter, and is therefore interwined with and impacted by the different laws and aspects of a given society.

Also depending on your field of studies, the people you graduate with are very likely going to be people you see often in your career. So make as few enemies as you can, and do people favors. There's a chance you will benefit from it.

**Summary:** Americans might get paid slightly more than in Europe, but they pay a lot more for things that Europeans take for granted (like healthcare). 

I remember a time when a entry level Camaro would cost $25k. That was, at the time, £15k. Less than a new Peugot in the UK. You may earn more if converted into Euros, but you have to pay for medical insurance. A European can save £500 from his salary every month for 30 months and buy an American car. An American would have to save for a lot longer to be able to ***survive***, let alone buy a car.

&gt; Citizens of the US are taxed on worldwide income regardless of where they live. 

Umm, ever heard of FATCA?

&gt;The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), which was passed as part of the HIRE Act, generally requires that foreign financial Institutions and certain other non-financial foreign entities report on the foreign assets held by their U.S. account holders or be subject to withholding on withholdable payments.  
&gt;  
&gt;The United States taxes citizens and residents on their worldwide income. Citizens and residents living and working outside the U.S. may be entitled to a **foreign earned income exclusion** that reduces taxable income.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_earned_income_exclusion#cite_note-1) For 2017, the maximum exclusion is $102,100 per taxpayer, $104,100 for 2018 (future years indexed for inflation).[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_earned_income_exclusion#cite_note-Forbes_2015_Taxes-2)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_earned_income_exclusion#cite_note-Forbes_2016_Taxes-3)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_earned_income_exclusion#cite_note-4) In addition, the taxpayer may exclude housing expenses in excess of 16% of this maximum ($44.19 per day in 2015) but with limits.  
&gt;  
&gt;The exclusion is available only for wages or self-employment income earned for services performed outside the U.S

&amp;#x200B;

People pay me for advice on taxes and investments. Being a native-(level) English speaker, Americans make up a large portion of my clientele. What is your interest/experience in this matter?

&amp;#x200B;

(You are left with $100 free at the end of the week and spend $50 on bowling and $50 on shoes whereas someone in India has $10 and spends $5 on bowling and $5 on shoes, only the Indian has free medical care and studies at university with student accommodation provided for free, whereas you have to pay for medical care, studies and accommodation)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_countries_by_average_wage#European_and_transcontinental_countries_by_monthly_average_wage

Pay attention:

&gt; Purchasing power parity (PPP) is a neoclassical economic theory that states that **the exchange rate between two countries is equal to the ratio of the currencies' respective purchasing power.** Theories that invoke the purchasing power parity assume that in some circumstances (for example, as a long-run tendency) **it would cost exactly the same number of, for example, US dollars to buy euros and then buy a market basket of goods as it would cost to directly purchase the market basket of goods with dollars.** A fall in either currency's purchasing power would lead to a proportional decrease in that currency's valuation on the foreign exchange market.

&gt; The concept of purchasing power parity allows one to estimate what the exchange rate between two currencies would have to be in order for the exchange to be at par with the purchasing power of the two countries' currencies. Using that PPP rate for hypothetical currency conversions, a given amount of one currency thus has the same purchasing power whether used directly to purchase a market basket of goods or used to convert at the PPP rate to the other currency and then purchase the market basket using that currency. Observed deviations of the exchange rate from purchasing power parity are measured by deviations of the real exchange rate from its PPP value of 1.

&gt; PPP exchange rates help costing but exclude profits and above all do not consider the different quality of goods among countries. For example, suppose that two countries produce the same physical amounts of goods as each other in each of two different years. Since market exchange rates fluctuate substantially, when the GDP of one country measured in its own currency is converted to the other country's currency using market exchange rates, one country might be inferred to have higher real GDP than the other country in one year but lower in the other; both of these inferences would fail to reflect the reality of their relative levels of production. But if one country's GDP is converted into the other country's currency using PPP exchange rates instead of observed market exchange rates, the false inference will not occur. Essentially GDP PPP controls for the different costs of living and price levels, usually relative to the United States dollar, thus enabling a more accurate depiction of a given nation's level of production.

**Thus**

&gt;Norway has a Net PPP of **3,678** USD

&gt;Luxembourg has a Net PPP of **3,834** USD

&gt;Switzerland has a Net PPP of **4,280** USD (considerably more than the next best contestant)

And you know where the US is left? **3,300** - 25 bucks better off than Denmark, or 192 bucks better off than potato famine-stricken Ireland.

In simple layman terms, Norwegians, Luxembourgers and the Swiss can afford a lot more bowling seshes and shoes per salary than an American.

They also get free medical care, which they get to save money on thus giving them *even more* bowling runs and pairs of shoes.

The average net wage in Switzerland is CHF 5,136, which translates to 5222.70 USD. There are 12 months in a year which makes the average wage $62,672.40

&gt; Under Section 911 of the US tax code, the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion for 2018 increases from $102,100 in 2017 to $104,100 in 2018

$62,672.40 is 60.20% of $104,100

So there you've just eaten up 60% of your permissible ""tax-free"" salary.

&gt; The exclusion is available **only for wages** or **self-employment income earned for services performed outside the U.S.**

So: 

- my rental properties in Spain would get raped at whatever federal income tax bracket they fall under
- My Bitcoin sales would trigger capital gains in the US (somewhere I wouldn't live, and the person you replied to doesn't live in the US. If they even thought about moving, they'd have their US passport renewed)
- My inheritance would be taxed in the US though none of my ancestors were who they were because of the US helping them in any way

Anyone (and their children, up to one generation born outside of the US without spending significant time in the US) who wants to do that which makes the most money - real estate, crypto, investments, business *does* have to pay taxes to the IRS on these lucrative opportunities regardless of where they live. Someone who moves to Europe would rather be a European citizen with visa-free access to the US than an American.

""A Night in Tunisia"" or ""Night in Tunisia"" is a musical composition written by Dizzy Gillespie around 1941-2 while Gillespie was playing with the Benny Carter Band. It has become a jazz standard.

It is also known as ""Interlude"", under which title it was recorded by Lennie Tristano (on Mercury), and, with lyrics written by Raymond Leveen, by Sarah Vaughan (from the EP ""Hot Jazz"", 1953) and Anita O'Day. Gillespie himself called the tune ""Interlude"" and said ""some genius decided to call it 'Night in Tunisia'"".

e5nw8wb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/9d4y6e/,1,"there is few reasons for that : 

most common example that people mostly  don't rush and move out of their parents houses , you may see a married guy with kids who still lives with his parents while he builds his own house somewhere probably close to his parents house or even building second floor on the top of his parents house , so since he still lives with his parents and don't pay rent and comfy he ain't rushed in the building process so he will just save money and start building then take break to save more money to go to the next phase , he would end up building his own house in 10 years .

other example is that parents have extra money so they start building for their kids to help them in the building process like they have enough money just to build the main shape that's it. so they use it and then give it to their kids when they grow up in most cases this happen when parents build second floor for their houses .

also  people may be too broke and  don't care much , so they don't make the final touch of decoration u may find unpainted walls or just bricks .. unpainted doors .. no tiles .. etc which make the house look like abandoned but actually people do live there and they don't care much.

&amp;#x200B;

finally you may be asking why they don't save all the money and build once for all , well the answer is the constructions costs get more and more expensive every day so it's better to rush building as soon as possible even it means that you will start now and then stop for a while ",2018-09-09 13:40:29

The reality is that Tunisia and other less developed countries don't have much else in terms of comparative advantages aside from land and resources. On top of that, the relatively slow development of these countries basically invites resource exploitation--countries will extend their advantages where feasible. This is pretty universal: if western Europe doesn't do it, other countries will (e.g. China), and if the tables were turned --if Tunisia and other countries in the region developed faster than Western Europe-- those countries would've been the ones held down and exploited instead. There's a lot of historical and cultural aspects, as well as feedback loops and other dynamics, that led to the current situation that I left out for the sake of brevity, but this is the general gist of things from my perspective. 

I'm not going to say that what has and is still happening is 'correct', but it's just the natural way of things. I realize that what I said is not something that I imagine you'd like to hear, but I prefer stating harsh truths over comforting lies.

The good news is that climate change *might* make the relationship between your region and Western Europe better because the threat of mass immigration due to a changing climate is real and creates substantial incentives to stabilize the region and also gives more leverage as the region's co-operation will be needed to stem the flow of refugees.

&gt;do you even know the situation in France before speaking about it ? If you lived there you would know

What a way of discrediting everything I said without answering it directly. Yes I know the situation in France, thank you very much, or else I would've looked more into it myself right now. I have an uncle in France. My GF teaches French for a living (but she doesn't believe in promoting France's interests nilly willy. Language is but a tool). I've been talking with a lot of French people since the 2000s, and I refuse to go to France myself because to me it's the **enemy**(For the same reason I refuse to go to Western nations and Israel. Would you go and visit your enemy nation if you didn't have to ?). I don't know if the rest of your comment is ""anecdotal"" or not, since you didn't bother with providing sources, but either way I think it might be too short..

=
&gt; If you lived there you would know multilingualism is on the rise and many French universities, mostly/only teach in English nowadays (especially business) much like in Tunisia

Did I say that multilingualism was not in the rise in France? Here is what I said

""They want to be alarmed about the prolificacy of English withing its youth""

Meaning that yes, this is exactly what I'm alluding to. However my point was why was this happening to France and that [not everyone is happy about it there](https://www.thelocal.fr/20140415/french-tv-viewers-complain-about-use-of-english). How are you trying to even dispute this is just beyond me.

French universities teach in English only because French is not as adopted worldwide as is English and because the USA is leading the world in many domains. I don't know of any STEM American University that are teaching in French, only the Arts and Literary ones do. The same was true for French universities before World War II. No sane mind in a position of power would've promoted multilingualism in his own country if he wasn't forced to by his geopolitical position. There can only be one top language at any given time and if it's yours then you're spared the burden of having to learn another top language if you want to compete. Simple as that.

Meanwhile, Tunisian Universities teach mostly in French and no English, except the very, very few at the top. And I know this because I studied in a public STEM Tunisian university that is recognized as a good one by everyone (except me and a few others who actually studied there) and 99% of the courses were in French, except one or two. It's common knowledge that Tunisian universities are lagging behind, even behind the French Universities they've been copying for decades.

=
&gt; Furthermore, local languages are promoted since 2000 

[If whenever people want they country to ratify the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, the central government keeps saying that it would ""introduce a fundamental inconsistency into the constitution.”,then France is doing a very poor job of promoting their local languages](https://www.thelocal.fr/20140123/in-france-there-is-only-one-language). All already existing efforts are local made and the government is only offering token gestures to calm people down. Make no mistake about what the authorities would prefer though, it's just that they're usually incompetent and have their hands already full with other pressing issues.

[Reread my](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_policy_in_France#Minority_languages_and_endangered_languages)

[Links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_policy_in_France#Opposition_to_language_policy)

[Again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_France#Status)

And tell me again how the central government is promoting local languages since 2000?

=
&gt; (even Tunisian and other Maghrebi languages, which Tunisia does not do by the way)

I don't know if you're talking about the Tunisian Dialect or the Amazigh language, but the Tunisian government (and many Tunisians) have been rather busy promoting French for decades. The result we all know and that I wish everyone would just admit it outright and stop tiptoeing around is that our Tunisian Dialect is just a mess of incongruous Arab, Amazigh, and French rolled out together, with all the newer words usually being French (or more recently, English).

=
Don't ask me, I was speaking a perfect Modern Standard Arabic up until I was 7 years old in my daily life and with my Tunisian Dialect speaking peers just because of the sheer amount of Arabic I was reading and listening to in TV (until I got influenced by them), and even then I can write and speak French better than some of the most hardcore ""proFrench"" people out there. Ask all the foreigners who came into Tunisia expecting to hear Arabic or learn it, because it's supposedly ""An Arabic Country"", only to become disilusioned at how French is more prevalent than Arabic and end learning more French than Arabic words instead. 

=
Tunisia is just still suffering from the aftermath of the French language becoming the primary Education language during the protectorate, and all ""efforts"" to reverse the trend have been insufficient or token gestures, when the French Lobby is still holding most of the power and institutions. French has well succeeded into implementing itself in Tunisia, only at the expense of Arabic, even if you keep tiptoeing around it and denying it.

=
I want ""The French Diaspora in Tunisia"" to embrace English more if they truly believes in their ""multilingualism"" (since by definition they didn't care as much about the Arabic half of their ""bilingualism""), and I want the French people to taste more of the medicine their government inflicted on us, and maybe one day they'll stop having colonial apologists amongst themselves and amongst their government.

=
Again, and I reiterate on purpose, **FUCK FRANCE**. Once it gets out of Tunisia once and for all, then we'll reconsider. They are tainting true multilingualism and using it as a vehicle for their agenda, and are also being hypocritical about it as to not used by others against themselves. Most of what French offered to me, English offered it to me as well. **French is only a bonus today for Tunisians after you get good at Arabic, and after you get good at English, because French is even losing ground in its own homeland**. You're free to think otherwise if you want, at your own detriment, and deprived of my sympathy.

=
And I'm all in for an Amazigh-Arabic ""Bilingualism"" in Tunisia (in contrast to the ""French-Arabic"" bilingualism we already have). I don't feel threatened by it in the slightest. I'd even push for it **myself** if one, I knew more Amazigh myself, and two, if the major parties that already advocate for Amazigh becoming an official language would just stop promoting ""French-Amazigh"" bilingualism out of hate for Arabs and Arabism. This is not only yet another exclusionary movement against those who are proud of their Arabic heritage, **it implies that once they'll finally and entirely marginalise Arabic once and for all, together with their French allies, that those French allies won't turn on them afterwards**. This is either a failure due to being history illiterates, or an intended end result. For me it's just a shame, I'll get into Amazigh more myself, but only after purifying the underlying political movement behind promoting it.

=
&gt; No one puts that into question, but if we could promote more multilingualism in the population then the better if we want to reach an international scope.

=
Didn't you get that I too want to promote multilingualism myself, just a different kind from the ""multilingualism"" you believe in ?!?!

=
Tell me if this sentence is a fact or no : I'm a job seeker, I only have time in the next weeks to only become proficient in one language to get a job, whether at home or abroad, and if I choose wrong my money will run out, I'll become homeless and I'll starve. Hence, because English is more widespread and more demanded in the professional world than French, I have better chances at survival if I learn English instead of France?

=
This is the EXACT same situation we're in in Tunisia right now. We are a poor country. We don't have problems with ""multilingualism"" per say because we already use French and Arabic in our daily lives. However French, except in some particular cases, has become nearly useless in the last decades. Therefore, **""if we want to reach an international scope."""", and get our shit together, English has to substitute French, and that march has already begun**. The ""French diaspora in Tunisia"" is the only obstacle to this right now, because they cling to their agendas and past ""visions de grandeur"". Some people would love Arabic to get substituted instead. Maybe, just maybe, they just want to suicide and drag everyone down with them. This is an euphemism on my part.

=
&gt; Contrarily to the US, UK or China, the average (young) European speaks around 3-4 languages, a definite plus in terms of intelligence and general competitivity

This a problem unique to Europe and its conditions. Between having to learn English as a world language to get shit done, countries that have 3 official languages like Switzerland, Immigration that brought Arabic to them, Eastern Europe who inherited Russian and Turkish due to their own history, and the simple fact that they have many ethnic languages and have to learn some of them if they want to function as an European Union, **I don't really care, nor want to emulate -if not imitate- them**. Last I heard, the EU was fracturing. US and China are not (yet).

&gt; Also business is mainly conducted in English in China.

Because they have to deal with the US (who dominates the business world). This is a testament to the power of English, not the love that China has for multilingualism. Most of all other domains in China are in Chinese languages only. ",2018-02-17 23:11:29

Now that we've transcended governmental divine law, any **philosophically consistent** constitution would agree that banning homosexuality has no philosophical or scientific ground.

&gt; A huge number of laws we have are unconstitutional yet they’re still in the books. Come back when we have a proper constitutional court. Until then, the 2014 constitution doesn’t mean much unfortunately.

I will take the bait though for whoever is reading this.

1) He isn't responsible for the attacks, you claim they happened during his reign and yes, the Bardo attack happened **less than 2 months** after he became president. Do you think they suddenly appeared there in a puff of smoke ? They are in Tunisia since years training in the mountains by extremists who entered the country during its instability in the years after the revolution. Friendly reminder when he got asked about them, former PM Ali Laarayedh said they were ""practicing sport"". Did you expect the new government country to find out about them less than 2 months into their taking their seats? If anything you should praise the government for the efforts they're making for the security of people. Tourism is on the rise, nothing happened since 2015 and yes I said the government, not the president because...

2) What ""reign"" exactly? the position of President of the Republic lost its power. He is basically tasked with proposing laws (like he is doing right now) and a bit of foreign policy (which he is good at since he is being respected in western countries and given his influence by a certain former president who was also respected oversees). The head of government is the one who holds the power and should be the most accountable for it.

3) Yes, ""The other guy would've been worse"" is totally a valid argument because remember who was the guy in the 2nd round against him? I would totally get out of my home to vote **against** the guy who managed to become the laughing stick of the common people and who made the Carthage palace his drinking yard.

eafl5jd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/9zzlan/,0,"&gt;  Women are inferior under Islamic law; their testimony in a court of law is worth half that of a man; their movement is strictly restricted; they cannot marry non-Muslims.

Women are not actually inferior, the rule stems from the fact that women tend to be more emotionally and that she might not recall everything in that specific event. As for how they are treated at home Islam preaches peace and it is forbidden to abuse women. Unfortunately some people turn into extremists ( which is also forbidden) and they break the rules of Islam as they will 

&gt; Non-Muslims living in Muslim countries have inferior status under Islamic law; they may not testify against a Muslim. In Saudi Arabia, following a tradition of Muhammad who said, ""Two religions cannot exist in the country of Arabia,"" non-Muslims are forbidden to practice their religion, build churches, possess Bibles, etc.

As for the the Non-Muslims living in Muslim countries they can in fact testify against in a non-Muslim, I know this as a fact. Saudi Arabia **DOES NOT** represent the Muslim world and it's people. Non-Muslims can in fact build their own churches and I myself have an extremely close friend of mine that goes to church every Friday (The holidays are different so they changed their prayer times) I have been to his house many times and they have a lot of crosses around their house and he did have a bible. When I asked where he bought it from he told me he got it from the church and he lent it to me for a couple of weeks to read.

&gt; Nonbelievers—atheists (surely the most neglected minority in history)— do not have ""the right to life"" in Muslim countries. They are to be killed. Muslim doctors of law generally divide sins into great sins and little sins. Of the seventeen great sins, unbelief is the greatest, more heinous than murder, theft, adult- ery, etc.

Now for Atheists the only reason they are to be killed is to stop them from committing sins it is best for them to die than commit more sins and hurt themselves. The God I believe in is not a God of wrath and evil but a God of Forgiveness peace and love.

&gt;Slavery is recognized in the Koran. Muslims are allowed to cohabit with any of their female slaves (sura 4.3); they are allowed to take possession of married women if they are slaves (sura 4.28). The helpless position of the slave in regard to his or her master illustrates the helpless position of the false gods of Arabia in the presence of their Creator (sura 16.77).

As for this I personally could't find any of the verses you were talking about. And if you fear that you will not deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry those that please you of [other] women, two or three or four. But if you fear that you will not be just, then [marry only] one or those your right hand possesses. That is more suitable that you may not incline [to injustice]. (surah 4 verse 3). And Allah wants to lighten for you [your difficulties]; and mankind was created weak. (surah 4 verse 28) And to Allah belongs the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and the earth. And the command for the Hour is not but as a glance of the eye or even nearer. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent. (surah 16 verse 77)

WTF. Can't you respond to something exactly and not make a strawman out of it. That's a suggestion not a decision. Not sure you know what the difference is. 



It's quite a good advice. For those that perceive something to be cancer, it's better for them to stay away from it. That's what sane people usually do. 



Unless they have some weird fetish about cancer and they obsess about it. 




&gt;Precisely. And yet, it's somehow Muslims who keep complaining all the time. What is it with privileged people getting upset over minorities having the same rights as them?




Again, Strawman.

It is a beautiful country, there are sights to see, places to go and things to do all around.

Bur the people generally suck. Tunisians you might encounter can be very bitter. I don't even know if there are much tourists right now, which could participate in you not feeling safe.

My advice, go to Morocco. It is not so different a country, and it has the main advantage of being touristic all year around, and Moroccans know to be nice to foreigners since they bring wealth to the country.

Many people have had nice experiences in Tunisia, but as of the state of the country right now, you would be better off not going.

Last time I went, it was 2 years ago. All I noticed is that the airport is a disgrace, unorganized, plain shitty, the country has gotten dirty, and many people have a hard time getting by. It is in a very hard transition period, and your best bet would be a more stable country.

Of course there is Hammamet, Sousse , Djerba, Carthage and Tunis, but those are much nicer in summer, and the weather in Tunisia will soon turn pretty damn sour. 

All in all I would love people to visit my country and boost our economy, since Tunisia has a lot of beauty to show, but so much things could ruin your trip and your image of the country, that I would advise you to postpone your vacation.
Maybe try again in a few years.",2018-10-26 06:44:20
eaduk9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/9zzlan/,-9,Well I get your point but what if our country got to the point of accepting gays and transgender legally such as giving them the right of marriage or to legally change their identity. I do believe they're humans and as an immigrant I treat gays equally as humans. I just don't want our future generations to think that being gay or transgender is alright because honestly it's not. That's what I fear the most for our country if it is to become secular. I believe that if we were to have a just and a religious government one in which believes in forgiveness and treating everyone equally with Islamic finances placed in then not only will we be the fist Arabic democratic country but we can and will be the best country. ,2018-11-24 20:26:28
