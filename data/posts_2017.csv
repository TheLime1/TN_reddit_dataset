I lived in Tunis for 2 months one and half year ago, and while there I used to buy this spice in a nearby store: http://i.imgur.com/gQcB3d3.jpg

It's used to make couscous, and the owner of the store told me himself that it was proper to make couscous with. It is just delicious! It's spicy, but not too hot. Just the right amount. 

I have brought a full back with me when I came back, but it's almost finished, and I cannot find anything like this anywhere (I live in Portugal). But maybe if I knew the name of it, I would be able to find it.

So i have a bank account in the BIAT bank, and it's not a saving account (compte d'épargne), it's the other one, they call it ""compte courant"" or something. 

I have it cause i pay most of my bills online and i also need it because i'd like to check my balance and transaction online too.

So far everything is good, 

but some days (like today) where i needed to withdraw money twice per day, the ATM just keep rejecting my request without any explanation, it just say ""rejected"". 

I have enough money in my account to cover what i need to withdraw, i also made sure of that by checking my balance in the ATM and everything seems fine,  in the first withdraw i only took 300dt, then i wanted to withdraw another 400dt, and it keep rejecting me, i even tried to withdraw 50dt and again still doesn't work. 

Someone told me that the credit card is limited to 1000dt/week (which is ridiculously stupid) but I am 100% sure that i didn't withdraw anything this week. 

So can anyone please tell me if this is a common thing or what ? 

thank you and have a good day


**EDIT** 

4 hours later, i withdrawed another 500dt  ago from a different ATM. seems that their system is totally random... ",,,,,,2017-01-14 13:14:09

La Tunisie est un État libre, indépendant et souverain, l’Islam est sa religion, l’arabe sa langue et la
République son régime.

Le présent article ne peut faire l’objet de révision'' (source : http://www.legislation.tn/sites/default/files/news/constitution-b-a-t.pdf ) 
While Tunisia was never Arab, it was the invasion by arabs that brought islam as well the Arabic language, which is according to the constitution is the official language of the country, (while really) without being our mother tongue:

We do not even use Arabic in our daily life we ​​rather use our dialect, which is influenced by other languages ​​including Arabic / French / Berber ...Certainly it has made us Arabic speakers not Arabs, as well the French invasion that made us French speakers and not French.

So the first article alone quietly suppresses the whole history of Tunisia and all of North Africa, and make us Arabs (as an ethnic group) who speak Arabic as a mother tongue, added to that, a muslim state.

This is actually my first time posting here. Nice to meet you all!

I'm actually trying to find a job that involves using one of those skills:

- Writing/speaking in English +++ (or French too. It just seems that there is a lot more competition for jobs in French)

- Video Editing (mostly Sony Vegas Pro, a bit of Adobe After Effects) +++

- Photoshop (banners, logos, signatures, etc...)

I've searched online but I found nothing. And I want to leave my city so searching here would be meaningless. I kinda hit a dead end.

I wanted to ask if anyone here knows of some businesses that need/recruit people with one of those skills, but do not require a degree? (Because I'm a medical student so I have no official degree proving the skills above, I just learned them in my spare time).

The job can be either part-time or full-time or even just an internship, I don't mind.
Of course I'm searching for a paying job, not volunteering.
The business can be a startup or even a library lr something, doesn't have to be something big (I doubt big companies would recruit a degree-less candidate...)

Any information you might have would be helpful! Even if you heard a friend of a friend talking about something like this or if you saw an advertisement sticken on your school's wall!

I am visiting a friend who is currently on a work assignment in Tunisia. My friend is in Sousse and I will land at Tunis–Carthage International Airport. My two questions are:

- What is the best method of transfer? I wanna book a private transfer from the airport to sousse but I do not know what service to chose from. Any recommendations here?

- The second thing is that i can not deny that im a little bit nervous about this trip, my country issued several travel warnings for tunisa. Can i expect to run into some weird situations or does it all get blown out of proportion?

I'd like to know if this is an ant you see a lot, if it's considered as an endangered species or if it's common. In the second case I would love that someone catch and send me a queen so I can raise them. 

I know this is a weird demand, but if there is another antkeeper on this subreddit I'm ready to exchange it against a french species of his choice. 

I'm asking that without knowing the laws about this kind of things in Tunisia so let me know if this is not allowed.

-Remove the r/tunisia from the list because you are already in the sub.  
&amp;nbsp;

-Link good places to visit in tunisia  
&amp;nbsp;

Add some rules like:  

&amp;nbsp;
 
-Don't  insults users based on ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or religious beliefs.  
-No advertisement or spam  
-All content must be related to tunisia.  
&amp;nbsp;

And what language are we allowed to speak with( najmou na7kiw bil derja!)  
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

-change the 749 ""readers"" to ""harrisa eaters"" for example

-A more beautiful banner

So in 2016 i made a sum of *~60,000dt*, the year before, it was less than half of that, and this year am dedicated to double that sum.

And few days ago i was talking with a friend *(a jobless graduate, unfortunately like most of us mid-20s)* and he said that all he needs to make his life better is a loan or an investment of 20,000dt, I asked if he could share the idea of this ""life saving"" business, and he proudly said, ""a coffee-shop""...

I didn't want to get any deeper because there is nothing else to talk about, but this kept me thinking, what if i decide to start doing something in this country ? what will it be ? 

If i was just like him, and suddenly i got k20dt or more in my pocket, what will i do with it ? 

So I would really like to know if any of you has any idea about profitable fields and whatnot, of course you won't be sharing your next ""world changer"" startup, but again, if any of us had that we wouldn't be wasting time on reddit lol.

And in case you're wondering on what am currently doing to make that okay-ish amount of money,
I am a game developer who's been working as a freelancer for the past ~4 years, i [posted here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/52xnyc/my_monthly_income_since_i_decided_to_start/) few months ago to showcase my current progress (and hopefully motivate some of you that the Internet can be profitable). 

But as much as I like what am doing at the moment, to me, making games was always a creative passion more than a Business, and i would really love to keep it that way, and in the meantime start something else to eventually reach the point of [passive incomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_income). 

So, share whatever you can think of about this subject, and please note, the *""take your money and runaway from this shithole country""* answer is not acceptable.

Like for exemple when people keep giving a young couple in the street weird looks, or when some others get arrested for having a sexual intercourse privately, in their house, because they aren't married and/or are homosexuals. Like honestly who cares ? Last week people were celebrating...the closing of a point were beer was sold legally. I mean okay they won't be as many ""clocharat"" but that was a problem that could have been dealt with by the police. Was it really something offending enough (that people buy beer) to celebrate ? 

More recently there's that british DJ that included a portion of the adhan in a clip, now he may face jail time (although he already left the country) and some others want to close discos all together. And from what I saw in FB a good amount of people got offended as well. I don't know how to feel about this one. I mean yeah some may think it is offending but I thought it could be solved with an apology and that's it. Personally I experienced it as Civ 5 has a track with a portion of the Adhan in it as well and I didn't really bat an eye, if anything I thought it was pretty good.

My own guess is that it's a modified M48 Patton, but I can't determine for the life of me what that thing is on the commanders hatch. My first instinct was laser, but it could just be a regular machine gun mount. The closest picture I have found so far is this M48A5.
Can anyone help me identify the tank and the modification? I'm also interested in roughly the year this could have been left derelict and maybe even the reason (for example, after a war or particular incident).

I am pleased to post here our first official official job offer here :)

I have been working since 2 years on a crypto-currency payment system, and we proposed Bitdinars as a crypto currency solution to La Poste Tunisienne. (https://medium.com/vink-io)

Please take a look at our long format policy before reading the rest of the offer. (https://github.com/ostl/Constitution/wiki/Long-format-policy)

My company is called Vink, and we are / work-with bankers, economists, cryptographers, pentesters, computer scientists... Nobody is paid yet.

As a Tunisian company operating in Tunisia from Berlin, jointly with La Poste Tunisienne, we are actively working for people to expand our community of developers to collaborate and work with us. We look for people who share our motivation in creating an industry from scratch, first of all.

We evolve in a an environment where we speak English and have direct access to notable actors in the banking, crypto currency, and computer security worlds. Across Berlin, Milan, Zurich and Tunis. You are the Tunisian hackers I know.

Any support is very welcome. Everything is to build at Vink, and everybody is welcome with no distinction (age, race, gender...). Students, impassioned, curious or supporters are welcome.

We are a bunch of guys with computers, trained in international waters. We would not hesitate to give you all we can, if we see that you believe in the free (from freedom) exchange of ideas. In exchange we we expect motivation and dedication.

We can arrange incentives for the most motivated, and potentially hire them, but we will seek for the people who are trustworthy and with us for the long run. For now we don't pay salaries. And we even have a blacklist.

Vink is a software company, first of all. We develop software for banks.

If you, or someone in your circle of influence is interested, I would be very glad to make a follow-up. I am available here or Linkedin or twitter.

The Dinar has dropped in value. A planned Ramadan terrorist attack foiled. Is Tunisia turning the corner towards a more stable democracy?","This past week has been a hell of a week in Tunisia so going to keep this one open a little more. and break it up into 3 parts.  You can discuss whatever ones (or all of them) that you wish.

1.) The Dinar dropped suddenly last week.  Though it caught most people off guard, it's been predicted for a while with the dinar eventually landing at 1USD to 3TND by the end of the year.  What are your viewpoints on this?

2.) The Ministers of Finance and Education were fired this past week too.  The former Finance minister had come under criticism after she suggested this month, Tunisia’s central bank would reduce its interventions so the value of the dinar steadily declines. (See point 1)

3.) Sunday, Police were able to intervene and killed 2 militants.  One killed by police, the other exploded a suicide belt and killing himself.  Investigations have led to the finding that an attack during Ramadan was planned and has now been foiled.  They tracked them from Sousse to a house in Sidi Bouzid.  This is a more general topic for discussion.

------------

Please make sure to keep comments civil.  Insults and name calling isn't to be tolerated and those comments will be removed.  Please keep in mind that everyone here is most likely a Tunisian or a resident of Tunisia (like Myself) so be kind. =)

If you want to discuss something else, please feel free to do that too.  These are up a week and sometimes, something else may happen that is newsworthy so that can be discussed here too.",,,,,,2017-05-02 10:48:37

**Sidebar updated**

As you can see we updated our sidebar and added some simple rules to it. The only real difference to what we had before is that you should not editorialize titles. For exemple if you want to post an article about a politician, post it with a proper unbiased title about what the article is about, then give your opinion in the comments if you want to.

**Subreddit Header**

As many of you pointed out, updating the header ([the image at the top](https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/LV38AFET5cVdyJLl.png)) would be a breath of fresh air for the sub. Feel free to suggest pictures or illustrations that you find representative of Tunisia that could be included in it. If you want to do one yourself, you can! The proper dimensions are 1920px-150/200px (You'll get credited for it).

I'm Lebanese (Hi kifkon ça va?) and I'll be visiting your awesome country soon. I just have a question or two to ask &amp; it would be super cool if any of you could answer! (Obviously I won't ask about security / safety, cuz Lebanon lol).

1) I want to go on adventures and meet as many people from different backgrounds, where would you suggest I go to make that happen?

2) I want to see both sides of the country, the touristy one and the hidden gem / popular / underground one. What cities / regions do you suggest?

3) Are most Tunisians approachable? Because I like to talk to random people in cafes, restos, on the street, in the bus etc.. So is that cool? Or is it generally frowned upon to strike up a conversation with strangers?

4) Any other general recommendations / suggestions that you would like to share?

Thanks a lot guys, and if anyone wants anything from Lebanon, PM me! Yalla bye :)",,,,,,2017-05-31 10:59:26

Hotel bars are friendly enough, but kind of lame. Any bar that's open during Ramadan is probably really cool.

On a side note--is there any sort of punk scene in Tunisia? I've noticed a lot of Zapatista grafiti. I even saw a couple commercial trucks with Che spray painted on them.

I am considering buying an apartment in Tunisia to rent out. I am a British citizen. What are the requirements to get residency in Tunisia? Does the purchase of this house make me a resident? I read that I can show income of about £6000 a year to get a residency permit.

I also read that after 5 years of residency in Tunisia, I can apply for citizenship. Does this mean I can get a Carte de Sejour, live in Europe, and then return to Tunisia after 5 years of owning a CdS and apply for citizenship? In some jurisdictions, merely having the residency makes you a resident... what does the law in Tunisia say?

Also, is it true that I can buy a new car in Europe, not pay the 21% VAT, and instead register it in Tunisia on RS plates? Does this mean that I can drive this car (""temporarily"") into Europe? Also, RS plates are for foreigners, so if I import a car at the beginning of my CdS and then apply for citizenship, will my plates change from RS to normal type, or will they remain the way they are? Will I be made to pay taxes on the car?

Does Tunisia charge residents taxes on worldwide income? Will the tax office follow me if I get a CdS and do not declare any of my income from abroad? For example, you can be a resident of a country in Europe, but not a resident for tax purposes unless you spend 183 days in a year in that country.

I just arrived in Tunis a week ago and have a few questions I was hoping someone here could help me with.

I've spent a lot of time in Egypt, and at the coast there it's possible to buy day passes to the hotels with private beaches, which lets you use their facilities and beach space etc, does anyone know of a hotel in Tunis with a similar sort of deal?

Secondly, I've played football for a number of years and am keen to play here as it's a good way to meet people, anyone know of a 5/7/11 a side game going on regularly? I stay in حي الواحات so something near there would be awesome.

And finally.. what time do people eat in the evenings? I went out at 6.45 in la Marsa and found that everywhere was shut and didn't open till 7/7.30. Then the next day I was in the city centre and found everywhere closed at 7.15. So it's a big of a mystery!

I will be staying in Tunis for the next three months for a summer job and I am incredibly excited. However, this will be my first time in your beautiful country or even in Africa, which is why I have some questions ahead of my visit that I would appreciate answers to :) 

1. What is the level of English proficiency amongst Tunisians (especially in Tunis)? I know that Arabic and French are the two main languages whilst English is less commonly know, but as someone with no Arabic knowledge and very basic French proficiency, will I be able to survive just on speaking English around the capital or should I revise some basic French phrases?
 
2. Phone Sim Card: Any suggestions as to which provider I should go with, what plan is the best value for money? I definitely need 3G internet access always, so I need a plan with lots or even unlimited data as well as good reliable coverage. 

3. Safety concerns: I've been reassured several times by my employers that the country and city is safe to visit, but I just wanted to see what you guys think. Do you have tips about things that I shouldn't do, places I shouldn't visit etc.?

4. The summer heat: how do you guys stay cool? I see that the temperatures can reach above 40 degree celsius, and as someone who has lived in western Europe most of my life, that is really making nervous that I won't be able to stand the heat. Are most buildings air conditioned? Any tips about how to sleep at night, (which I am most worried about)?
5. This might be a somewhat weird question, but what do Tunisians think of Chinese people (I am Chinese). Do people in the capital see many Chinese people (i'm thinking tourists). Will I get looks and stares around the city if I just go on a jog or a walk alone? 

Thank you for reading this long post! Any advice/tips/suggestions that are not related to the questions above would also be appreciated (must-dos, places to eat, things to try etc) :) ",,,,,,2017-07-12 05:59:02

2) I come from Malta, which is just an hour away from plane. How well known is Malta? If I say I come from there would people know of it?


3) How wide-spoken is English? In Malta, we speak a language similar to arabic so I believe I can understand around 50% of the language depending on the accent. I also speak some basic French as I studied it a few years in high school. I think this should be fine, right?

6wkohx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/6wkohx/soon_to_be_indian_graduate_looking_to_move_into/,3,Soon to be Indian graduate looking to move into Tunisia.,"Hi everyone. This is my first time posting here, so I hope this'll go good.  

I'm an Indian student who is currently pursuing a degree in Economics. After moving in from Saudi Arabia to India, and after having living here for about 4 years, my heart yearned to explore new horizons. This made me look out for alternate countries I could possibly shift to after I finish my education, and while doing so, I stumbled upon Tunisia. The descriptions that I've read about the country (I've read accounts of people having quiet, peaceful lives there, and that made me feel like I would be very much at home over here) have pretty much made me want move in here. Also, I think I'll do pretty well in Tunisia, since I have not only lived in an Arab country before (though I recognise the fact that Saudi Arabia and Tunisia could have cultural differences) but I have also learned French at a basic level, and can improve on my french once I get there, in fact, I plan on taking French classes to further this goal. However, I do have a few questions. 

1. How easy is it for a person who wishes to immigrate into Tunisia to find a job there, especially in fields such as Finance, and Human Resources? How keen are companies over there regarding taking expats, in particular Indian ones? 

2. How is social life in Tunisia? Are people who live in apartment complexes in the Urban areas friendly towards their neighbours? 

3. I'm not exactly religiously Catholic, but I'm very attached to the cultural aspects of my faith. I've been a very active volunteer at my local church. Are there many Catholic churches in Tunisia, in particular, Tunis? Or are there very few churches? 

4. Is there a thriving fandom scene in Tunisia, with comic conventions and the like? 

5. What kind of attitudes do Tunisians have towards foreigners, in particular, Indians? 

Thanks a lot, everyone! :D",,,,,,2017-08-28 16:54:03

I'm u/kungming2, a mod over at r/translator. We're working to make our multilingual community *the* universal place on Reddit to go for a translation, no matter what language people may be looking for. 

**Would anyone be interested in helping translate any future Tunisian Arabic language requests on r/translator?** You don't even need to subscribe to our subreddit itself, and most of our requests are pretty simple and don't require advanced knowledge of the language. 

**We have a [notifications system](https://www.reddit.com/r/translatorBOT/wiki/ziwen#wiki_notifications) that only sends you a message when a Tunisian Arabic request comes in.** Just send a message to our subreddit bot at the link below.

### &gt;&gt; [Get Tunisian Arabic translation notifications](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=translator-BOT&amp;subject=Subscribe&amp;message=%23%23+Sign+up+for+notifications+about+new+requests+for+your+language%21%0ALANGUAGES%3A+AEB) &lt;&lt;

You can unsubscribe from those messages at any time, and you'll be helping out redditors in need. Thanks!
