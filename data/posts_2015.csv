I'm from Hungary, but I have always wanted to visit an Arab country in my whole life, and it seems Tunisia will be the first, yay! I'm not really interested in any of the tourist stuffs, if I could freely choose I would just spend a week in an Arab village and talk to locals. I'm usually more interested in cultural stuffs and especially how local people live their lives when there are not tourists around, but I'm travelling with my girlfriend so I will mostly do the regular stuff.

I like to be prepared, reading a lot about the place where I go but before I start, I thought it would be a good idea just to ask here. So what are the do's and don't do's? Also, if you could write some polite phrases in Tunisian Arab (like welcoming someone), I'd grateful for that, too. 

Thanks in advance!",,,,,,2015-02-26 15:59:29

I'm Portuguese and I'm applying for a internship in webdesign in Tunis. The payment is 320 TND/Month, and the work hours are 6h work/day, so I guess I will have a lot of time to explore.

My questions are basically:

* is the payment is enough for a month?

* what is the average cost of living/lodging?

* what should I expect from the natives (mindset/culture)?

* how are foreigners treated?

* how high is the criminality?

* how is Tunis during the summer?

* do I have to get some kind of vaccination?

Any other important topics that I didn't mention are welcome too!

I am 22yo tunisian who was born and raised in Italy, and as such I have a double passport. 

I completed my Bachelor's Degree in Architecture this past september, and I am now studying for my Master's degree, with hopes of continuing with a Phd. 

I would like to continue my work in academia, but I would be happy to work as an architect.

It may sound too romantic or cheesy, but I feel like I am home pretty much only when I am in Tunisia (I have come back for vacation every two years since I was born), and as such I was wondering how are the possibilities of employment in my sector, especially in the academics (and if its possible to make a decent living out of it).

I currently speak:

-italian: with a perfect level of proficency

-english: with a good level of proficency

-arabic: but only tunisian. A shame of mine is being unable to write/read arabic, but I speak tunisian decently (for example I can understand 90% or the talk in a tv show, but very little of a news segment). I hope to improve this once I graduate

-french: at a very basic level.

Is the idea of working or teaching (after some years of exprience) in Tunisia feasible, or am I delusional? 

Thanks to everyone who will reply!

1. Are there any customs and traditions I should be aware of? (I'm also a muslim and understand that most muslim countries are conservative)

2. What should I do to make this trip to meet her the best time for her. Any particular activities a Tunisian girl might enjoy. We will be in Tunis mostly.

During the past 2 weeks i got asked almost everyday if i could load someone ""Nettler"" card or his PlanetWin account (i've been making mobile apps for the past 2 years and i always have money in my foreign bank account). today i saw more than one Facebook announcement about new ""stores"" that sells 1€ for 3TND!! so basically you give them 1.6€ to take 1€. 

So can anyone explain what the fuck is happening ? and is this legal ? Am really worrying about this because am 100% sure that it will effect the upcoming international credit card made for developers, these scammers will just request a card that has 1000TND and find a way to sell it back for  1600TND, this will really be bad for us (developers) because even if it won't affect us right now, the number of the given card compared to how useful it was in development would be very obvious and it may lead to bad results, for example the government may think that this was a bad decision and they just cancel it. 


So please let me know what do you think ? 


Have a good day :) ",,,,,,2015-04-29 22:13:20

So, we need ideas.  I know that /u/enti_san and /u/flesmih have gone to the ones in the past 2 years and they had a great time.  Someone else, I forget who, went to the second one and someone to the third one, I forget their names, so my apologies.

We need ideas.  Bowling?  Cafe?  Ruins of Carthage?  I'm not from here so I'm not sure what to do exactly.  

This is going to be just before Ramadan so would be a great time to get together and eat and drink while we still can.  

Some ideas:

Bardo Museum: Attendance has been down since the attacks and it would be great to go and show solidarity for the country and against the terrorist trying to scare people away

Cooks: [A good restaurant in Sidi Bou Said](https://www.facebook.com/cooksfood?fref=ts).

Golden Cafe: [Another good place for food](https://www.facebook.com/GoldensCafe?fref=ts)

[Berber Village](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293758-d7197902-Reviews-Berber_village-Tunis_Tunis_Governorate.html) Not sure what this place is but sounds interesting.  Thoughts?

I will also try to get some playing cards (If you have some, let me know) so we can play some cards.  I can teach some games like No Limit Texas Hold 'em, Go Fish, Rummy, or Bullshit (Can be called Liar if played in public).  If anyone has any board games (scrabble, settlers of catan, Ticket to ride, that sort of thing) please let us know.

We had 3 people the first and I think 4 the second.  I'd like to see a lot more people, like 10.

If you have any questions, suggestions, or concerns, please, post here and let us know.  I know that Ramadan is soon but this is going to be just before so this could be your last chance to really eat and drink and relax on a weekend before the holidays.

Countries that aren’t in Europe aren’t on the visit list. You're going to Tunisia...where is that? Did you see the news of that attack in Tunisia - don't go there. Support for my leaving on this very unclear adventure is at an all time low. You can find support for anything on the internet, all sorts of weirdos out there -- so here I am. I'm not really worried about my security, but I do enjoy being alive. And I’m not really worried I’m getting in over my head, I didn’t sign up for anything but to keep living. I’m only casually self-discussing the darija course at the Bourguiba institute. 

First off, my plan is this, I've got a guy on couchsurfing that says I should bring him some organic cacao nibs and he'll let me stay with him for a bit until I can find an apartment. The chocolate is in the mail, Habibi. I've ended up with an extra 600 dollars a month (this is enough right?) in my life to go hang out in Tunisia for a bit. I want to run the beach, eat the fresh food, swim around and get tan and feeling good. My Arabic understanding is pretty bad with this Tunisian dialect (I've been watching some Tunisian films - oooh lala) I understand gulfies more. I was a student of Arabic for several years but when talking to people I would hear a sentence without understanding a single word sometimes. I throw my MSA out there, smile, they get what I'm going for, then they start talking like a baby to me. Its pathetic, but it gets the shugul done. 

My flight date approaches. I bought my ticket before this fiasco and I’m poor so I’m flying there just to get my money’s worth. I’m reading through everything on google about expats or Americans in Tunisia. I suppose its not everything, I'm only reading in english. Bien, merci. Ca Va? Bonjour, bon voyage, menage a trois, mime - thats all the French I know. And I'm too lazy to use the Arabic right now. But I’m reading through all the english expat materials and basic travel information sites.

I've always been extremely proud of my Tunisian heritage, I still am. From the early history of the Phoenicians travelling to the cape of africa to the north of europe, to Carthage and Hannibals father founding Barcelona. 

Hell, Tunisia gave women the right to vote over 20 years ahead of portugal and sweizz. And the university-graduation levels are on par with Sweden which is quite amazing considering the history of ben ali.

So I must ask; **How is it that there are so many educated tunisians joining ISIS?** My father couldn't answer me when I asked this, he didn't even know the statistics and found it strange. As do I, because from everything I've experienced of tunisia it's a great, open and somewhat secular country. 

[So why do some decide to join ISIS?](http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-why-so-many-of-tunisias-youth-are-drawn-to-isis-2014-10?IR=T) I want to know what down to earth tunisians in tunisia have to say about this

I am also curious as to how ISIS is percieved in tunisia, since from all that I've read people seem to not think to badly of ISIS. I know that all stories have two sides, just look at russia-today, al-jazeera, and CNN covering stories and you see widely different views. But from all the news I gather ISIS seems to be such a horrid party, worse so than saudi arabia, qatar etc. and I've lived a year in Saudi-Arabia and I hate that country with a passion.

It all just seems so weird to me that the tunisia I love, the tunisia I am proud of, somehow also is the biggest source of isis jihadists in the muslim world. ",,,,,,2015-06-30 03:30:35

I am from Bizerte, and will probably study in ESPRIT or SESAME next year (IT), but this post isn't about me, i know someone who want to study in the same area but doesn't have anything to do with Technology (bac lettre) also she doesn't want to study things related to economy, marketing or management. 

(eg: Business English, Optics and Eyewear, pharmacy, etc...)    

I know about the UC (*université central*) but it's a little bit far.

What song would you recommend from your country?,"السلام عليكم /r/Tunisia ! I'm trying to put together a playlist that has one song from each country in the world. What song would you recommend from your Country for me to add to my playlist?

You can check out my submission to /r/Africa [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Africa/comments/31u7kw/hi_rafrica_im_creating_a_playlist_with_one_song/) if you are interested in checking out some suggestions from other countries in Africa or contributing songs from other African countries that you don't see mentioned!

Please don't downvote if you don't like the song, only if the Artist is incorrectly being represented as from/involved with your country or if it's an obvious troll suggestion!

**Rules:**

-I'm not looking for anything *stereotypical* to represent the country culturally, just an enjoyable song by an artist from your country! Feel free to choose those kinds of songs if you like however!

-The Artist has to be from or live in the country.

-The song *does not* have to be in the language of the country but it can be.

-The song can be any genre, contemporary or traditional. The majority of songs chosen so far have been contemporary but I don't want to discourage traditional submissions at all if you feel they are still enjoyable today.

-Feel free to recommend songs that you have heard or know of from other countries! (Although these tend to be downvoted so PM these if you don't like downvotes!)

-Links are appreciated! (If you say ""Anything by *This Artist*"" please link to your favorite song by them)

***Examples of songs/genres I have added so far:***

[Germany - Modern Pop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYNLQjrBVPo)

[New Zealand - Reggae](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCJg63SziL4)

[Norway - 80's SynthPop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djV11Xbc914)

[Mexico - Classical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvEwYbWqeQg)

[Russia - Hip-Hop/Alternative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ATS_XC_CI)

[India - Traditional/Emotional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDn2bn7_YSM)

[Kenya - Pop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEJw64Zl28U)

[Argentina - Alternative/Rock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gASdixLAqLM)

You can see there is a wide variety and I'm not looking for one specific thing, just a song that I enjoy! Thanks for your input in advance and enjoy the musical discussion!

I am wondering the state of Tunisia right now following the recent attacks. Especially in regards to security and safety of Caucasian/Christian/Americans. 

A band I am in is supposed to play the brand new International Noise Festival in Hemmemet in August and we are now rethinking going.

They usually don't send these out unless there is a good reason to.  I know there is probably all of 1 American here (Me) but it has some good advice.  I will copy/paste the important parts of the text below:

The Embassy of the United States in Tunis alerts U.S. citizens traveling or residing in Tunisia to the publicly reported closure of Avenue Habib Bourguiba, a main downtown artery, until Monday, September 14 for security reasons.  The Ministry of the Interior has also announced a ban on all demonstrations for security reasons, citing threats against ‘sensitive sites’.  The Department of State has further been apprised of information that, out of an abundance of caution indicates we should institute precautionary steps.  As a result, the Embassy will not offer public services on Friday, September 11; other Embassy business will continue as scheduled.  The Embassy will continue to provide emergency American citizen services as needed and resume public operations on Monday, September 14.

U.S. citizens are reminded to exercise caution and avoid areas where large gatherings may occur.  Even demonstrations or events intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly escalate into violence.  U.S. citizens should monitor local events, report suspicious activity to the local police, and take appropriate steps to bolster their own security. The U.S. Embassy reiterates our standing guidance that U.S. citizens in Tunisia should exercise caution when frequenting public venues that are visited by large numbers of foreigners, such as hotels, shopping centers, and tourist sites and restaurants.  U.S. citizens should also be alert to the possibility of kidnapping. 

Travelers contemplating trips to the interior of the country should assess local conditions and routes when making travel plans.  In particular, all travel south of the designated military zone in the south must be coordinated in advance with Tunisian authorities.  Also, travel to either border should be avoided if possible given the periodic security incidents along the border regions.

Charguia or Cite El Kahdra areas would be okay too I guess.  Just something close to Jeanne d'Arc or somewhere close to N8/N9/A1 that would make for a fast commute into Jeanne d'Arc.",,,,,,2015-09-30 12:25:35

I`m looking to reach out to people that are interested in pursuing a degree in Romania.(I am romanian) You see, statistics show that a large part of the foreign students we get here are from Tunisia.

Well, I had the experience of studying abroad and it was just a huge ,chaotic mess without any sort of guidance.And I had the advantage of knowing the local language.

 What I want to do is be a guide for everything that a person wanting to come here would want or need- for a small fee.

My question would be : could you give me some advice as to where I could post such an ad ? Some major newspaper/ ad website or anything similar is what I am looking for.

I've been having this issue since last year, every time i try to use my credit card (BIAT) either in Tunisian payment websites (TunisineTelecome, orange,  sobflous.tn) or in a local shop that accept credit card for payment, i always get the same ""error"" : 

&gt; Insufficient credit or limit reached

&gt; (Crédit insuffisant ou limite atteint) 


Which is not true, i have enough money in my bank account to do the ""wanted-task"" and i rarely use my credit card with the ATM. 

Can anyone explain this please ?? 


Also, do you recommend another Bank ?  
I've been a BIAT customer for 2 years now and am a bit disappointed, specially when it comes to online services (i receive all my payments internationally and every time that happened i have to go to the bank and ""manually"" check if the transfers has been successfully received or not, which is ridiculous! )

anyway,

It is a custom here to choose a guest of honour (a country or a region) to promote it among Belgians. Last year it was Quebec and before it was Mongolia I think. Efin, this year it is Tunisia. This means that a part of the market is reserved for stands with food and products of the country.
Normally the Christmas Market is well visited, but this year most tourists have cancelled their trips to Brussels because of a higher terrorist thread, so sadly it is very quiet.
