I mean isn't the capital supposed to be our most known city? Like the city that has the richest history and shine..

President Ghannouchi, in an interview with the Qatari daily “Al-Sharq,” commenting the weak commercial exchange between his country and Doha under 170 million dollars, that the improvement of the situation in fraternal Libya will represent a unique opportunity for the two countries under the control of the Muslim Brotherhood.

Ghannouchi is considering a tripartite commercial partnership between Tunisia, Qatar, and Libya.”A Tunisian-Qatar-Libyan tripartite economic partnership for investments in peace and reconstruction in the Libyan state would be a real turning point,” Ghannouchi said in a long interview.The president of the Tunisian parliament – most criticized in the history of the North African Republic – indicated that the eighth session of the meetings of the Tunisian-Qatar joint committee will be held next March. The event will celebrate the signing of over eighty agreements in various sectors. This joint committee work will focus on adopting the maritime line between the two countries and removing all obstacles to a true partnership in the air transport sector, serving Tunisia, Qatar, and Africa.

Tunisia is preparing to launch a comprehensive economic program to restore cooperation with neighboring Libya, aimed at stemming the damage caused by the coronavirus emergency, which led to the closure of the land and air borders between the two countries for months. Trade between Libya and Tunisia decreased by 70% in 2020. Turkish and Chinese goods have filled the shelves of shops in Libya while the population suffers from the continuous increase in prices due to the progressive devaluation of the dinar in exchange for the dollar.

Despite political negotiations conducted by the United Nations through the Libyan Political Dialogue Forum (LPDF), the situation on the ground between the forces of the Government of National Accord (GNA) supported by Qatar, Turkey, and Italy, and the Libyan National Army (LNA) of General Khalifa Haftar, remains tense in the Sirte area. The joint military committee, composed of officials from the two sides, formally called for the withdrawal of the Syrian mercenaries transferred to Libya from Turkey and the Russian forces. However, this appeal has remained unheard as for today. In recent days, we have seen demonstrations by Syrian mercenaries coordinated by Ankara because they have not received the promised wages for months.",,,,,,2021-01-05 18:23:08

I've posted a while ago an inquiry about ways to get around **PayPal** ( and other digital banks ) in Tunisia and some people messaged me to ask me if i've found anything interesting, well sadly unless you have a relative outside of Tunisia you can't trust the traders here.... i've investigated YouTube, Facebook, websites about the #winou-paypal movement that happened years ago, anyway the minister of technology said on the Radio that The central bank of Tunisia which is the one people are 'blaming' isn't solely responsible of not being able to get PayPal ( or others ) to work here, and that they did their best to find ways around our monetary policy ( carte technologique )  which is btw since 1976 ( approx ), isn't that really outdated? i mean the laws prohibits any possession of foreign currency but PayPal insists that's the reason why they refused our application, so the minister said that some people are working on changing the policy. and that since 2016 - 2017, is it that hard to change these? is the weight of currency black market heavier than getting some unemployed people to get work online? anyone can answer this? Plus even if this is mainstream, thousands of people actually want it to happen. And our economy depends on phosphates which crumbling right now isn't it the right time?

**Ps** : i know **everyone is freaking tired of PayPal topics i personally wanna hit my head on the screen.** but as much as we hate it, we're that dependent i mean **gambling/crypto/freelance/goods** if that**'**s taboo well our economy is dependant on such ""taboo"" ( alcohol, cigarettes, smuggling,  customs  stealing from people's packages...) ... i have friends from india that literally are living with online freelancing. should we start another **movement or event but with a different motto**?

\&gt; I only speak English, can read Arabic but not speak it well at all, nor French. Is that a problem for any of the cities? Or which one of them will only English be more than helpful in?

\&gt; Does the quality of hospitals differ between the cities? Might be a weird question so sorry about that, but like in my own country the major cities generally tend to have a better hospital and facilities in general.

\&gt; Which city overall would you recommend as the best for a student staying for a month? In terms of safety, friendliness, enjoyment etc

Tunisian got expelled from the Arab League afterwards. Here is his speech in baguette :"," Chers frères,   


Je ressens en ce moment un double sentiment d'émotion et de fierté. Ému,  je le suis lorsque je pense à l'ampleur du désastre que nous avons subi  en Palestine il y a dix-sept ans. Mais en même temps, l'enthousiasme  qui vous anime, la volonté farouche que je lis sur vos visages, la  détermination à reconquérir vos droits, tout cela me réconforte et  consolide mon optimisme.   


Vous savez sans doute que le peuple tunisien alors qu'il menait encore  une lutte âpre contre la forme la plus abjecte du colonialisme, a tenu à  apporter sa contribution dans la guerre de Palestine. De tous les coins  de Tunisie, jeunes et vieux sont accourus ici pour prendre  effectivement part à la 1utte dont l'enjeu était d'assurer l'intégrité  d'une terre arabe et musulmane qu'ils considéraient comme leur seconde  patrie. Le peuple tunisien a pu, au bout de vingt-cinq ans de lutte,  fonder un État solide et moderne sur une terre d'Islam débarrassée de  toute co-souveraineté et de toute forme de domination politique ou  militaire.   


Mais nous pensons en Tunisie que notre action ne se circonscrit pas à  l'intérieur de nos frontières, La Tunisie qui a combattu le colonialisme  est consciente du rôle qu'elle doit assumer dans la libération de  chaque pouce de la nation arabe demeuré encore sous l'emprise de  l'étranger. J'avais déjà proclamé à la première Conférence au sommet  arabe, que la Tunisie était décidée à mettre à la disposition de la  cause palestinienne toutes ses potentialités. Je le proclame à nouveau  aujourd'hui. Il est toutefois un point sur lequel je voudrais attirer  votre attention : vous êtes les titulaires d'un droit violé  ; à ce  titre vous vous devez d'être à la première ligne du front ouvert pour la  reconquête de la Palestine. Il est de mon devoir de vous entretenir en  toute franchise d'un certain nombre de vérités que vous devez avoir  présentes à 1'esprit : D'abord votre rôle dans la lutte est primordial.  C'est ce que vous ne devez jamais perdre de vue. D'autre part, je  voudrais dire, en ce moment où je m'adresse à tous les arabes partout où  ils se trouvent que mon expérience personnelle, issue d'une dure et  longue lutte, m'a appris que l'enthousiasme et les manifestations de  patriotisme, ne suffisent point pour remporter la victoire. C'est une  condition nécessaire. Mais elle n'est pas suffisante. En même temps que  l'esprit de sacrifice et de mépris de la mort, il faut un commandement  lucide une tête pensante qui sache organiser la lutte, voir loin, et  prévoir l'avenir. Or, la 1utte rationnellement conçue implique une  connaissance précise de la mentalité de l'adversaire, une appréciation  objective du rapport des forces afin d'éviter l'aventure et les risques  inutiles qui aggraveraient notre situation.   


Il faut donc nous armer de lucidité, élaborer soigneusement nos plans et  créer toutes les conditions de succès. Il faut préparer les hommes et  les doter de moyens. Il faut aussi renforcer notre potentiel de lutte  par l'appui de l'opinion internationale. Éviter toute précipitation  dictée par la passion, agir avec discernement, en vue d'arriver au but,  voilà l'essentiel.   


Si toutes ces conditions sont réunies, alors notre cause triomphera,  d'autant plus sûrement que le Droit est de notre côté. C'est aux  responsables qu'il revient de réunir les atouts du succès. Ces atouts  nous manquaient lorsque nous avions, il y a quelques années, engagé la  bataille, cette fois-ci, c'est sans répit qu'il faut travailler pour les  réunir. Nous devons profiter des expériences passées et nous imposer un  grand effort de réflexion. Déjà nous sommes sur la bonne voie  ; mais  la voie est longue. Pour aboutir au but, notre action exige loyauté,  sérieux et courage moral.   


Il est extrêmement facile de se livrer à des proclamations enflammées et  grandiloquentes. Mais il est autrement difficile d'agir avec méthode et  sérieux. S'il apparaît que nos forces ne sont pas suffisantes pour  anéantir l'ennemi ou le bouter hors de nos terres, nous n'avons aucun  intérêt à l'ignorer, ou à le cacher. Il faut le proclamer haut. Force  nous est alors de recourir, en même temps que se poursuit la lutte, aux  moyens qui nous permettent de renforcer notre potentiel et de nous  rapprocher de notre objectif par étapes successives. La guerre est faite  de ruse et de finesse. L'art de la guerre s'appuie sur 1'intelligence,  il implique une stratégie, la mise en oeuvre d'un processus  méticuleusement réglé.   


Peu importe que la voie menant à l'objectif soit directe ou tortueuse.  Le responsable de la bataille doit s'assurer du meilleur itinéraire  conduisant au but. Parfois, l'exigence de la lutte impose contours et  détours.   


Il est vrai que l'esprit s'accommode plus aisément de la ligne droite.   


Mais lorsque le leader s'aperçoit que cette ligne ne mène pas au but, il  doit prendre un détour. Les militants à courte vue pourraient penser  qu'il a abandonné la poursuite de 1'objectif. Il lui revient alors de  leur expliquer que ce détour est destiné à éviter l'obstacle que ses  moyens réduits ne pouvaient lui permettre d'aborder de front. Une fois  l'obstacle contourné, la marche reprend sur la grande route qui mène à  la victoire.   


Plus d'un leader arabe s'est trouvé dans l'impossibilité d'agir de cette  manière. Pourtant, notre défaite et l'arrêt de nos troupes aux  frontières de la Palestine prouvent la déficience de notre commandement.  L'impuissance des armées à arracher la victoire malgré l'enthousiasme  des combattants était due à ce que les conditions de succès n'étaient  pas réunies.   


Aujourd'hui, les chefs d'état travaillent sérieusement à mettre en place  un commandement qui soit au niveau de ses responsabilités. Mais cela ne  saurait suffire. Il est nécessaire que les peuples se gardent de gêner,  par des débordements passionnels, l'action des dirigeants. Il ne faut  pas que leur attachement obstiné à une certaine ligne de conduite mette  les responsables politiques en difficulté pour l'exécution de leurs  plans. Il ne faut pas qu'on accuse de défaitisme ou de compromission tel  au tel leader arabe parce qu'il a proposé des solutions partielles ou  provisoires si celles-ci représentent des étapes nécessaires sur la voie  de l'objectif.   


Mais, pour que le peuple ne gêne pas ou ne tasse pas échec à l'exécution  des plans arrêtés, il est nécessaire - comme c'est le cas en Tunisie -  qu'il ait confiance en ses dirigeants. Disposant ainsi de leur liberté  d'action, ceux-ci sont en mesure d'avancer plus sûrement vers  l'objectif. Il m'est souvent arrivé de me trouver dans l'obligation pour  être maître de certaines situations, de recourir à la «  politique des  étapes  ».   


Lorsque certains militants faisaient preuve de réticences, je  m'efforçais de les convaincre que ma méthode ne pouvait déboucher que  sur la victoire, surtout lorsqu'apparaissaient chez l'adversaire des  signes de faiblesse. Il fallait alors ébranler ses positions de force,  entamer son moral et en même temps renforcer davantage notre position.   


Quant à la politique du «  tout ou rien  », elle nous a menés en  Palestine à la défaite et nous a réduits à la triste situation où nous  nous débattons aujourd'hui.   


Nous n'aurions en aucune façon réussi en Tunisie si nous n'avions  abandonné cette politique et accepté d'avancer pas à pas vers  l'objectif. A chaque pas, à chaque conquête par le peuple tunisien d'une  nouvelle position stratégique, la France cédait une partie de ses  privilèges  ; pour elle, c'était un moindre mal. Elle s'imaginait  pouvoir ensuite arrêter le processus. Mais chaque point stratégique  conquis augmentait davantage nos moyens d'action. Le processus devenait  ainsi absolument irréversible. Ainsi, pas à pas, la France s'est trouvée  acculée à la dernière bataille, la bataille de Bizerte où elle ne  pouvait que céder définitivement.   


En Palestine, au contraire, les Arabes repoussèrent les solutions de  compromis. Ils refusèrent le partage et les clauses du Livre blanc. Ils  le regrettèrent ensuite.   


Si nous avions, en Tunisie refusé en 1954, l'autonomie interne comme  solution de compromis, le pays serait demeuré jusqu'à ce jour sous la  domination française.   


Il est donc essentiel que le commandement ait la liberté de manoeuvre,  qu'il soit capable de prendre telle ou teLle initiative et qu'il ait des  qualités de sincérité, de probité, de dévouement et de clairvoyance.   


Je tenais à vous faire part de ces réflexions en tant que frère rompu  depuis longtemps à la lutte anticolonialiste. J'ai inculqué les notions  que je viens de vous exposer à vos frères tunisiens qui ont fini par  adhérer à tous mes plans d'action.   


Il leur est arrivé parfois d'en éprouver un certain malaise. Malgré  cela, ils ont accepté de s'engager sous mon impulsion dans telle ou  telle expérience car ils ont mis à l'épreuve mon dévouement et ma  clairvoyance. Ils ont constaté les résultats. Aujourd'hui nous sommes  libres et indépendants.   


Voilà ce qu'un frère a voulu dire à l'occasion de cette visite. Voilà le  conseil que je crois devoir vous donner ainsi qu'à tous les Arabes. Il  est nécessaire d'appuyer les sentiments et l'enthousiasme par une vision  claire des données du problème, pour que notre action soit pleinement  efficace.   


C'est un homme en tout point désintéressé qui vous le dit, un homme dont  vous ne pouvez contester la sincérité ni la profonde affection qu'il  vous porte.   


Nous arrivons au but. Nous n'aurons pas à passer dix-sept ou vingt  années encore à nous lamenter vainement sur «  la patrie perdue  ». Nous  en tenir aux sentiments serait nous condamner à vivre des siècles dans  le même état. Ce serait l'impasse.   


Il faut que, de la nation arabe, montent des voix pour parler  franchement aux peuples, savoir que la lutte doit se poursuivre avec  tout ce qu'elle comporte de détours, d'étapes, de ruses jusqu'au jour où  nous aurons arraché, non seulement pour nous-mêmes, mais aussi pour les  générations futures une victoire complète et définitive.   


Je vous demande de méditer sur ces propos. Chacun de nous aura à rendre  compte à Dieu et à sa propre conscience, de ses intentions et de ses  actes.   


Mon voeu le plus cher est que les Musulmans vivent dans une communion  des coeurs encore plus étroite, que les dirigeants réalisent entre eux  une meilleure compréhension et combattent tous les complexes de quelque  sorte que ce soit : complexes d'infériorité vis-à-vis de l'ennemi dont  on serait tenté de surestimer les forces, complexes de supériorité qui  risqueraient de nous précipiter dans une catastrophe que nous pouvons  sûrement éviter, grâce à un recours incessant à la raison et à  l'intelligence.",,,,,,2021-01-12 20:19:52

**TL;DR**: I plan to have my masters in Spain and would like your help by answering some questions. *(you can skip the context)*

# Context:

I got my university diploma last July in IT and chose to continue my studies in Spain.

I went around and talked to some agencies and decided that I would learn Spanish (A1, A2, B1) here (in Tunisia) to save money and because of covid-19... Then I would take the last level B2 in Spain.

I called the Spanish embassy and they recommended I go to the "" Instituto Cervantes De Túnez "".

That was my fuck up, I should have gone straight to Spain. The classes at ""Cervantes"" are good but SLOW. I was just informed that I would get the A2 level by the end of June. I looked at other schools and pretty mush everyone told me they don't do accelerated classes in the winter.

At the end of January, I will have my A1 level and if possible I'll go to Spain to try to obtain the B2 level before September 2021 so as not to lose another year.

# Questions:

1. Which agency did you use? And would you recommend it?
2. What was your level of Spanish when you went there for the first time?
3. Which language school did you go to (in Spain)?
4. How long did your linguistic stay last?
5. How long did it really take you to start speaking fluent Spanish?
6. How much did you spend a month? (food, rent, bills, ect...)",,,,,,2021-01-13 13:39:04

Ten years after Tunisia’s Revolution, which sparked a wave of uprisings across the Middle East and North Africa, victims are still struggling to obtain justice and reparations for grave human rights violations committed during the revolution, between 17 December 2010 and 14 January 2011, said Amnesty International today in a detailed statement. 

“These trials may be the last chance to achieve accountability for the crimes committed and to deliver justice to the victims and their families. But they have been significantly undermined by the persistent obstruction from the security sector. Security officers have ignored court summons and orders, egged on by their unions who have called for a boycott of the proceedings,” said Amna Guellali, Amnesty International's Deputy Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa.

Instead, we live in a complete shithole after an entire decade since 350 poor souls sacrificed themselves for the following generations to live rather a fairly comfortable life.   
Riots should continue. Revolutionary violence is justified. This revolution is fueled by hunger and despair. People are literally hungry and how did the government respond ?

\- The 2021 budget law dropped out article 38 which was meant to hire 10.000 jobless university graduates who have been jobless for 10 years or more ( in Tunisia there are 200.000 jobless university graduates, out of whom 60.000 have been jobless for 10 years or more).

\- The 2021 budget law also dropped out the proposal of rising the stipend dedicated to the poorest of the poor from 180 DT to 250 DT. 

\- The 2021 budget law also dropped out the proposal to spare small farmers and merchants' loans which are less than 5000 DT

\- There hasn't been a single CAPES concours in almost 5 years.

\- Newly graduate primary school teachers who worked for 16 months (from September 2019) haven't received their payment yet.

\- There are 3000 jobless Phd graduates in the country, many of whom have been protesting in the ministry of higher education SINCE JUNE. 

Not all the rioters are educated, but all of them are hungry., They have been abandoned by the system since a young age. They weren't monitored. They didn't receive an appropriate education. They didn't receive an appropriate healthcare. They were born in a poor neighborhood. The media raped their minds, wiping out whatever social consciousness they might develop and replacing it with Instagram ""celebrities"" nonsense. Their parents worked their asses to provide for them, simultaneously being unable to provide them with the necessary guidance to survive in this ruthless system. 

""No don't ruin your country protest peacefully"" we fucking protested peacefully and nothing happened. In a country where those who steal millions of dollars get away with it easily while those who steal to fill their stomach are imprisoned, I think the riots aren't ruining for everything is already ruined. Riots are fixing the 10 years of complete political failure.

Violent protests have swept at least 15 cities and police have clashed with teenage demonstrators, using tear gas and water cannon to disperse stone-throwing youths. Hundreds have been arrested and the army has been deployed to prevent the looting of shops and banks.

The explosion of anger — sparked by footage of police mistreating a shepherd — comes as the country marks the 10th anniversary of the revolution that toppled Zein el-Abidine Ben Ali, the long-serving dictator.

The government’s response to protests has attracted criticism. “Poverty, marginalisation and exclusion should be dealt with through fairness and dignity, not smears and criminalisation,” said the Tunisian Forum for Economic and Social Rights, a civil society group

While you will probably not be directly forced to get the vaccine (at least not in the beginning), i think you will be pushed to get inoculated, here is how:

* In order to work, employers will most likely require a proof of vaccination in order to allow you into the office to ensure the security of everyone in the office. 
* Primary schools may require parents to sign a conscent to allow their children to be vaccinated on site or require proof that their child has been already vaccinated somewhere else to allow him to continue school. The same thing should apply to universities who will require proof of vaccination to allow students in. 
* Stadiums, theaters, and other areas where lots of people get gathered will probably require tickets along with proof of vaccination at the entrance to allow people in. 
* Shopping malls, agencies, administrations will probably require you to show proof of vaccination at the entrance, just like they require face masks and temperture checks now. 
* You will be required to show proof of vaccination to be able to travel from country to country, this may be required by the airports, the airlines who will welcome you in their planes and they want to ensure that you're immunized before doing so, border control agents of different countries, etc.

You get the point...this is just my personal opinion, but i think most people can see that this has strong odds of happening, forcing you to get vaccinated to be able to live normally like they force you to wear masks right now. 

I believe achieving [herd immunity](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Herd_immunity.svg/330px-Herd_immunity.svg.png) by vaccinating the most vulnerable people and those who choose to get vaccinated by personal conscent is enough to lower the infection rate (assuming the vaccine works), Tunisia and other governments will most likely gradually impose rules to force everyone to get vaccinated, including those who don't want to for any reasons.",,,,,,2021-01-19 20:15:36

Leaving aside the exclusive nationalism, do you think a union between Morocco-Algeria-Tunisia is viable? I know it seems impossible, but do you think it would be positive for people's lives? It is clear that in terms of tourism, army and size it would be a top African power and I think one of the first in the MENA region. I know that in Algeria there are still people who hate Morocco and also the other way around, and the same with Tunisia. But I am sure it is an idea that we should discuss, since I BELIEVE that we would gain more than we would lose. It can even be a more symbolic union at the beginning, to slowly start this process. We don't have to start with an absolute union. And I also want to know if this hypothetical union would be better as a new federal STATE, or a simple MERCOSUR or even EU-type union.

Les Editions Arabesques viennent de publier un ouvrage signé par  Mustapha El Haddad sur un sujet tabou et, pourtant, d’une importance  exceptionnelle pour notre pays : l’embrigadement de notre jeunesse pour  le jihad dans les zones de conflit, l’Irak et, surtout, la Syrie, à  partir de 2012.

Ce n’est pas le premier sujet tabou sur lequel  Mustapha El Haddad lève le voile : en 2018, dans les mêmes éditions,  l’auteur publiait un livre intitulé : *Chronique de la violence politique sous la « Troïka » ; de janvier 2012 à décembre 2014.*

La  caractéristique majeure de ces deux ouvrages est leur rigueur et la  posture délibérément « neutre » qu’a choisie l’auteur : une présentation  brute des faits et des déclarations des différentes sources  pertinentes, sans commentaires. Pour laisser au lecteur le soin d’en  tirer ses propres conclusions.

*L’embrigadement des jeunes pour le Jihad* traite  d’UNE question qui figure dans la page de couverture du livre, et qui  montre la Tunisie premier pourvoyeur mondial de combattants en Syrie et  en Irak. Le ton n’est pas dénonciatoire ; il est froid. Mais il est  d’une richesse et d’une précision qui confinent à l’exhaustivité et une  source d’informations sans pareille pour ce qui touche à ce phénomène du  jihad tunisien.

Cinq chapitres structurent cet ouvrage de 240 pages:

**•** Combien sont-ils, depuis quand et où vont-ils ? (Chapitre I)

**•** Qui sont-ils et quelles sont leurs motivations ? (Chapitre II)

**•** Comment fonctionnent les réseaux d’embrigadement de ces jihadistes ? (Chapitre III)

**•** Quelles sont les forces en présence dans le conflit syrien et quels en sont les enjeux ? (Chapitre IV)

**•** Comment ce phénomène d’embrigadement est-il géré par les autorités tunisiennes ? (Chapitre V).

Pratiquement  toutes les sources concordent : les Tunisiens sont les jihadistes les  plus nombreux : entre 5 mille et 7 mille selon les sources et selon les  moments. Pourquoi ? Aucun facteur ne les prédispose par rapport aux  jeunesses des autres pays, bien au contraire ; c’est pourquoi le  sous-titre du livre est intitulé « Le paradoxe tunisien ».

Alors,  pourquoi ? L’auteur ne se vêtit de l’habit démonstratif, mais au fil  des pages et des faits, le lecteur comprend que la Tunisie réunit ; nous  dirions est le seul pays à réunir, toutes les conditions nécessaires,  pour donner essor à ce phénomène : la mise en place d’un réseau de  recrutement à travers des centaines de cercles, de mosquées, de cafés et  de réseaux sociaux ; l’invitation de grands prédicateurs étrangers  d’inspiration wahabite ou/et appartenant au mouvement des Frères  musulmans, souvent reçus en grande pompe pour faire des discours devant  des foules de plusieurs milliers (voire dizaines de milliers) les  incitant au « jihad » (le départ vers la Syrie) ; l’organisation d’un  réseau d’encadrement, de convoyage et de prise en charge matérielle des  nouvelles recrues par des centaines d’associations dites «caritatives »  financées par Qatar ; un réseau de camps d’entraînement et d’initiation  au combat ;  une prise en charge matérielle des nouvelles recrues depuis  leur départ de Tunis, leur atterrissage dans les aéroports turcs et, de  là, leur transport vers les zones de combat ; des ressources  financières considérables.

Tout cela est documenté avec précision, à partir de diverses sources crédibles.

Les  terroristes tunisiens ne limitent pas leur champ d’opération à l’Irak  et à la Syrie ; on les retrouve dans les très grandes opérations  terroristes qui ensanglantent l’Europe. Face à chaque opération de cette  nature, l’opinion tunisienne a la main sur le cœur : « Pourvu que ce ne  soit pas encore un Tunisien ! ». Ils sont, désormais, tout près de nous  : selon les statistiques les plus crédibles, le nombre de mercenaires  tunisiens employés par la Turquie, aujourd’hui déployés  à nos  frontières libyennes est compris entre deux mille et trois mille.

Dans *L’embrigadement des Jeunes pour le Jihad* », nous trouvons les éclairages nécessaires à la compréhension de ce fléau et, en filigrane, les acteurs qui sont derrière.

Cet  ouvrage de Mustapha El Haddad et celui qui le précède -Chronique de la  violence politique sous la « Troïka »- constituent, avec l’ouvrage de  Jean Fontaine « Du côté des salafistes », publié aux mêmes éditions,   l’une des pièces fondamentales de la mémoire de la Tunisie des dix  dernières années. Il faut en rendre hommage à l’auteur, à sa rigueur et à  son courage.",,,,,,2021-01-23 08:34:51

1. **Vehicles:** Internal combustion engine vehicles are everywhere and electric vehicles do not seem to be coming here anytime soon, even if they do, they will be very expensive for the average Tunisian at least for now, they will be cheaper in the future but the transition from ICE vehicles to EVs will be slow. 
2. **Factories:** factories are everywhere and none of them seems to be caring about the environnement or carbon emissions. 
3. **Greenhouse gases:** The greenhouse gases emitted from households around the country are huge, partly because no one cares and partly because of lack of education about the fact. Solar energy households are rare.
4. **Smoking:** A lot of people here are smokers, according to WHO: Tobacco smoking leads directly to the emission of 2 600 000 tonnes of carbon dioxide and about 5 200 000 tonnes of methane. Tobacco growing/curing causes significant deforestation. 
5. **Trash burning:** A lot of people burn their trash in the mountains. 

Global warming and climate change due to carbon emissions are a global issue but there are countries that are playing their part to reduce the impact, what do you think we should do to reduce our daily carbon emissions at least by a small percentage?",,,,,,2021-01-26 20:00:00

They did not even let me watch camera records.,"Attijari bank makes me lost half of my salary and they are not helping me at all with the investigation. They just make me spent the time and after 2.5 months I passed but I don't want to let it like that. At least I want to share the story here.

It is been 2.5 months since I wrote everywhere, I reached everywhere(included CEO of the attijari), To the bank center (many times), to the branches and call centers (that call center really had bad support, I event cant reach them, maybe 10/1 they responded to me on phone).

**The story is;**

I went to the Attijari Den den branch, As usual, I m using that ""Den den"" branch to take my salary. And last time when I went there, I went to one of the open windows and give my bank card to take my salary.

I take whole money with 10 dinars only. Normally they were not giving me whole my salary like that, But people were waiting behind me, with all mask and it was kind of busy. I put the whole money in my bag. And back to the house directly.

When I reached the house I found only half of my salary. All organized, with 10dinar. There is no other way to lost or miss in the way. So I was suspicious if they didn't give me full of my money. It was Friday so I had to wait till Monday to go to the bank and ask for my salary.

Monday I went there again. I explained the situation. At first, they seem to try to help me. But he was saying impossible to understand the amount of money with Security cameras. I surprised how a bank manager doesn't know that cameras exist mostly for following the money. I convinced him to check about the records. And he told me He will going to check the security records and will let me know. 

4 days later there was no news yet, so I went there again. When I reached, I could not find him, and the people in there told me to come tomorrow again so I went another day again. The other day finally, I've found him and asked about the records which he promised me to show.  He told me some excuses and told me to let me call you in Today. He called me later on that day and he said: ""We checked the records and we found you put your whole money in your bag"".  I was suspicious so I asked him to see the camera records. He told me to show up at the branch and I went there next week on Monday as first. Again I could not find that manager and no one was helping me. I went there 1 day later again and asked to see the security records. All my points to be sure if my money was full as they told me.

But he acts differently and told me to reach the bank center and ask for video records. He told me he is not allowed to show these specific records about me. After some days(25-30), and some run-around the bank decided not to show me the video records.  I sent them 3 different requests and all those requests closed in an hour. I don't know it was taking hours and days to reach that call center but they are able to close tickets less than in an hour. It was surprising how fast they were answering ""negative"" about my tickets.

And...

I passed on my money. But the lawyer I was speaking to told me to record all that story by writing a letter to the bank center.  I had to send it from the bank branch itself. I went there again. The manager was not there. So I went later again and Found him, he recognizes me, and I explained the situation to him one more time, And I told him I want to record all that story so my lawyer suggests me to write this letter. He doesn't even let me write the letter in there, even did not accept his claiming he told about the video records, etc... They even told me, we never watch your records.. but claim center did.. but that day when they try to convince me he told me clearly he watched the whole video and there are not any mistake. İ m suspicous they even dont have any camera record. Which makes me angrier and angrier. Anyway, I went to some other place to write that letter and back, Finally, I sent those records to the bank center. I don't have any hope and I don't have any trust in that bank anymore but I just want to record in Reddit too. At tijari bank makes I lost half of my salary. Doesn't helps me at all. They just make me spent my time and run-around all the time.

**Hope, anyone who works with Attijari aware of how you shouldn't trust your own bank.** **Hopefully, none of you faced with that kind of problem, because If you faced you will stay all alone.**

l6j787,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/l6j787/guide_how_to_buysell_bitcoin_in_tunisia/,23,[GUIDE] How to buy/sell Bitcoin in Tunisia,"This question and similar questions is asked a lot so here we go:

1 - There is an automatic service (website) that you can use to buy or sell crypto via the edinar card app (D17). This website is TRUSTED and the team behind it has been doing this for a while, their support is great which you can contact via their official Facebook page [TunisiaBTC](https://www.facebook.com/tunisiabtccom) (18.6k members). They also have this page [CryptoTN](https://www.facebook.com/www.crypto.tn) along with public group on both Facebook and Discord so its quite a transparency. I will include the groups below. So the exchange rate is what might be an issue for some people as their fee is about 30% if your buying but its only 3.7% if your selling. You can't blame them as that's how they run the business. Those fees are equivalent of 3.5TND per 1USD when buying and 2.6TND per 1USD when selling while the actual exchange rate of USD is 2.7TND. So like I said its roughly 30% fee if your buying and 3.7% when selling.


2 - Direct exchange via Tunisians crypto communities on Facebook and Discord. There will be the trust problem so you have two options here either you find someone in your area by posting or looking there and meet him/her and do the exchange face to face. Or in the Discord groups you will find a list of trusted buyers and sellers which you can trust them like 95% of the time, there is also escrow service. Now in these groups fee will differ from person to person but its in the range of 3-10% on average when your buying which is wayyy cheaper than TunisiaBTC (and even some international PoS) and when your selling its considered usual to also require this fee for buyers and add like 3-10% above the actual rate. Demand and supply is high and always there even for relatively high quantities so no worries about that as well. Anyway here is a list of these groups with their members count:

[21k 🇹🇳 Tunisians Crypto Exchangers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/TunisiansCryptoExchangers)

[16k Bitcoin Tunisia 🇹🇳 بيتكوين تونس](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Bitcoin.Tunisia.Exchange)

[11k Bitcoin Tunisia](https://www.facebook.com/groups/493478798011097)

[9k Paypal / Bitcoin / Skrill / Neteller in Tunisia](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1556354191273641)

[4.8k Bitcoin Tunisia 💰 🇹🇳 Exchange &amp; Vente](https://www.facebook.com/groups/bitcoin1tunisia)

[4k Bitcoin Tunisia](https://www.facebook.com/groups/bitcoin.tunisia)

[1k Bitcoin Tunisia - بيتكوين تونس 🇹🇳 Exchange and Escrow service](https://www.facebook.com/groups/cryptotunisia)

Note: This last group is owned by TunisiaBTC.com it had much more than 1k members but it was removed for some reason so they had to recreate it. I'd say this group represents a kind of quality among others. They also offer escrow service.

Now Discord groups in which you'll find a dedicated list of trusted buyers and sellers by the community. Also both groups have escrow service.

The envelope had been filled with an unknown substance that was believed to have caused the director to suffer an ""almost total loss of vision"", the statement said. 

The incident took place on Monday at the Carthage Palace but was not officially reported to the public. Following leaks that spread on social media, the office said it was compelled to clarify. 

The envelope was reportedly shredded before being sent to the ministry of interior for testing.

I’m an American who recently moved to Tunisia, and I want to learn how dating/hooking up works here. 

In the US, more sexually-open people will have sex on the first date or go home with someone they met at a bar. It’s not unusual for someone to have one or more friends with benefits, etc. Things are usually assumed to be non-exclusive unless a couple has a conversation about exclusivity. For more sexually-conservative people, they would probably more likely wait until after a 3+ dates to sleep together and mostly have sex in relationships.

I'm also sure that most of these newcomers are like me and you, fed up with their Facebook feed, annoyed by the mediocrity, and triviality of our media and political situation...However, that won't stop some people from bringing ""tafahat"" from  Facebook or projecting and spreading the hatred and the cyber violence that we can all see all over the comments on Facebook. That's why I strongly believe that we should update our community guidelines and make sure to remind everyone why we're here, how to communicate with each other, and especially the things that are not allowed...

lawo58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/lawo58/the_tunisian_political_crisis/,4,The Tunisian political crisis!,"&amp;#x200B;

As all authorities (the government, president and the parliament) having their reality show of drama and deception,

I wanna discuss what could possibly be the solution to it,

one side, calls for the political system to be a parliamentary system, others wants it to be presidential, others also want parliamentary system mutated with limited power to the president.

The trend thoughts now are: adjust the constitution, do a referendum, disassemble the parliament...

It's a political chaos and us the people and the economy of the country are the victims.

so here's my thoughts:

1. Constitutional court is an essential entity to resolve a lot of current issues and maybe later issues, but it's the parliament job to put into execution but due the current situation, it's an impossibility.
2. Does the referendum in your opinion going to help resolve the situation. As I'm afraid, the public opinion could be easily influenced by media, social media,...
3. Some people think that the presidential ruling could be the solution but as our history with that is horrible and in my opinion, a lot of people don't think way ahead of what they supposed to do.(e.g) what if the next president (in a presidential system) could've the abilities to turn it into a dictatorship again.

laxvu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/laxvu9/do_we_want_tunisia_to_be_a_real_democracy_or_not/,15,Do we want tunisia to be a real democracy or not?,"I see many people here saying that the police are just doing their jobs and not all of them are bad people. Some of them are even better than the average guy !
Also,
These protests are useless and they are just done for instagram fame and to stir up trouble since these protestors are not the real people suffering from poverty and exclusion but just some middle class leftist cringelords. 

The thing is, everything said above is true. But you are missing the point completely.

Let me ask you this: How do you expect the system to be changed for the better if we do not open our mouths and demand our rights by protesting ? 

We know that in every single capitalist country in the world there are big problems with how things are done. 
We saw this in the USA, in france, in England etc. 

Voting doesn't work sadly. It never did. The only way people actually got their rights were by protesting and history is clearly on our side. 

Women didn't just get voting rights in the west just because people voted. Massive protests took place by women who did everything in their power to be a part of society. Same thing for black people. Same thing for lgbt in America. I see a trend here. 

Right wingers keep moving the goalpost. At first they said ""the protests are bad cause people were stealing"".

Than it became ""the protests are bad because these people do them at night time and it only involves criminals.""

And now that people show up to large spaces and protest together peacefully by doing harmless shit that protestors all over the world do. They start saying ""Protests bad because they are protests"". 

Stop lying to yourselves.
You are not against protests. You are just against what these people are saying and you are angry that they get to speak. And if you are truly against protesting and want to live in a dictatorship, then props to you. Sadly I care about my people and want their voice to be heard. 

Point 1: Every single leftist above the iq of a frog will tell you that the cops are not to blame individually. And (excuse my massive hyperbole) the nazis were not bad people individually either. How can you blame an 18 year old for doing his job after being indoctrinated all his life and after being threatened if he doesn't obey the system ? 

The problem is clearly not the individual cops but the system itself that we are fighting against. The horrible statement of all cops are bastards (horribly written) doesnt mean that individual cops are bastards but that the system makes every single one of them bastards sadly. 

Point 2: Yes, people protesting are mostly young people (16-30 year olds) from middle class backgrounds. 

AND thats completely normal since that is the most educated and involved group of people in society.
I wouldnt expect any other group to be the source of protests. Sadly poor people in our country don't have access to good education and aren't even present in the middle class areas were the latest protests take place. 
But thats exactly what these people are protesting against. We shouldnt sleep peacefully at night knowing that our brothers and sisters are starving and don't have shelter. I congratulate any highly rich class traitor for going against his interests and supporting the protests for the good of our people. 

Now, I disagree with the message that young people are doing everything and old people just sleep. Since everyone had their time. Our grandfathers fought against colonial france and hundreds of thousands died. Our parents fought against the previous dictators and thousands died. We cant just say that these people did nothing for our country. They did plenty. 

""Some acts are done for pictures on Instagram.""

Let me tell you something interesting. This happens in EVERY SINGLE PROTEST in the history of mankind.
Taking clever propaganda pictures to promote the cause. Is not something unique to our protest it happened in 1914, in 1956, in 2011... 
Is it either loading your gun and blasting people you hate or sitting around doing nothing at all ? These people taking pictures have found that it is the best thing to do to promote their message without any violence. 

In a country were gay people, people smoking weed, people putting posts on Facebook, judges exposing corruption etc get jail sentences and get tortured. If you support the system because you dont like that a girl has pink hair or that a girl has armpit hair and leftists disgust your bigot ass or because ""poor cop feelings"" or ""poor billionaire feelings"". Just don't support the protests and stfu. You dont need to give your shitty useless opinion that harms our democracy and our people.

كل واحد يضربو او يتحرش بيه بوليس رد بالو يمشي يشكي للمركز او المنطقة، حتى كان يكلموه و يقولولو ايجا هاو باش نعاقبوه ما يمشيش.  100% من الحالات الي نتابعو فيها كملو كلاو طريحة او تلفقتهم تهم او تهضم حقهم بعد ما يتكتل عليهم الجاني مع اصدقاءه

الي تعرض لمظلمة يصب بالوقت  عريضة لوكيل الجمهورية  و فوائدها كالاتي:

اولا، يبدا عندو ديشارج على شكايتو لان المراكز ماتعطيش وصولات في الشكايات، و ساعات الشكاية بيدها ما توصلش للمحكمة و لا يمكن اثبات القيام بها و تنقلب الى ابتزاز بما انو القضاء سيعتبر انو الضحية ما شكاتش و بالتالي ادعاءاتها  باطلة اذا حبت تدافع على روحها  من التهم الكيدية الملفقة

ثانيا، حصل العلم للمحكمة بكل شي:يعني البوليس يولي مجبور كان يحب يجيب الضحية تبحث، يعمل استدعاءات قانونية و يعلم القاضي في كل مرحلة و ماعاش ينجم يفاجأ المتضرر بايقاف تعسفي دون احترام الاجراءات

ثالثا، التسخير الطبي الي ماشين تجريو للمركز باش تاخذوه  و تلقاو رواحكم في مواجهة اصدقاء جلادكم، بلاش بيه خير. افهمو: التسخير ليس ركنا قانونيا من اركان الشكاية، هو فقط وثيقة تعفي من خلاص معاليم المستشفي. يعني تهز عشرين دينار وتعمل فحص طبي في استعجالي اي سبيطار ، هاذيكا وثيقة اثبات رسمية. #ملاحظة: ما تقولوش ضربني بوليس للطبيب، راهو جلهم خوافة. قول مجهولين و مبعد فسر للقاضي.

مهم جدا: مادام تبحث بلاش محامي في المركز من حقك تسكت و ما تصححش، ضربوك باش تصحح؟ تقول هات المحضر نصححلك و تكتب ضربوني فوقو و ما تصححش، ما عطاوكش تقرا كلامك و قالولك صحح( اخطر حاجة ردو بالكم) تكتب لم اطلع و ديما ما تصححش. 
صححت بالسيف او وصلت للقاضي مضروب؟ تكبش و تموت تقلو عاين الاثار و ما تصحح الاما تقرا انو حط كلامك كونك تعرضت للعنف. مجلة الاجراءات الجزائية تقول ان اقوالك الي صححت عليها تحت التعذيب تسقط تماما ان ثبت ذلك.

I live in France and I am not able to go home because of the pandemic.

&amp;#x200B;

I usually watch a youtube channel called Tunisian street food and it makes me feel warm inside to see the streets of Tunis.

Is there something similar.  


Just to be clear, I'm not looking for the picture perfect places in tunis (Sidi Bousaid, Gammarth, ...). Those places are not for me. I'm a downtown kinda guy.

I'm just a Lebanese guy who has an interest in geopolitics and economics but I unfortunately don't know much about Maghrebi countries, but I kinda knew that Tunisia is doing better than the others.

I was pleasantly surprised when I noticed that it ranked 6.59 by The Economist in 2020 in terms of democracy making it the only Arab democracy; still a ""flawed"" democracy as per the index but only a handful of countries got rated as a ""full"" democracy. Mabrook for you, guys! w 3a 2belna (Lebanon is at 4.16, ouch!)

My question is how much do you feel that this rating reflects the reality of the situation in Tunisia and to what extent? (I don't mind a short rundown of Tunisian politics if you guys are willing)

Since he won’t be going back to France for a while, I had him buy me some supplies, like gadgets, some electronic devices and beauty products in bulk (3-5 pieces each for me and my family members).
Usually, he’d have absolutely no problem getting those through. 
This time, he missed the flight to Tunis Carthage Aéroport and had to take a plane to Zarzis Djerba for the first time. 
Well, the Douane there were a complete nightmare. Not only they confiscated the goods, but they also told him, ‘eh, you have to get back to our director in working administrative hours and you will either pay to get them back or maybe he’ll give them to you’.
My father returned to Tunis and then we took the plane to Djerba a few days later and their response was basically, ‘no, you can’t get those back because they have a commercial value, so you either have to give us an approval from the ministry of commerce and pay commercial value or you can take your stuff back with you to France, but oh no, you only have two months to leave and you need to inform us 24 hours beforehand and you have to leave from this aéroport and if you don’t, well, the stuff is all ours to do whatever we please.’
I’m pissed, and it’s not only because the things they confiscated are around 1000 Euro of value, but because of their sleazy ‘this will be ours and you’re lucky we’re even giving you an option to take your stuff back because you’re a resident in France’ way of talking. They were giving a whole speech as if it’s their money and they’re doing him a favor. Or that they didn’t waste our time and money by telling him you can come get it if you pay for it when it’s not the case. 
It’s probably pointless and I should chalk it up to stupidity and let it go, right?",,,,,,2021-02-04 22:07:44

Sometimes conservatives say it to avoid defending their backward views. Sometimes liberal stupidly say it, idk why. Maybe good intent, Idk. However, volutarily or not, the sentence is not designed to participate in discussion but to end it. That is not up to debate.

First of all, there is always time to discuss all issues. We are more than 10M big brain adults and we have all the time we want. Discussing covid every day, is unhealthy and counter-productive. The same is true for everything. We don't need a billion years with millions of brains to figure out 1 issue. And as we have seen recently this country ""doesn't have time for progress on social issues"" but apparently we have plenty for regress. Covid is important and we should talk about it. However, saying that we should stop every other political discourse is wrong. It's also weird that the people who want to end discussions are never harmed by any of the possible outcomes in the discussion they want to end.

So, my fellow tunisian libtards, stop saying this. You are doing no favor to anyone. You are even actively delaying public discourse on key issues that should be solved and ober with.

Btw, (bonus) makhlouf is a traditionalist, islamist, xenophobe and a bigot. If you are a liberal or a leftist and you think he is not (even 1 of those things) educate yourself. His rhetoric is fascistic and he engages in rightwing populism (fascism). It's embarassing if you fail to disgnose the issue. And, if you think he is a good politician, don't educate yourself, your brain will melt from overwork it can't take it.

EDIT : weed should be legalised. The extremism of the state about it needs to end. Tunisians are not stupid, we can be educated on drug use and we can make choices for ourselves. Not supoorting the protests is a failure to stand uo against authoritarianism. I made my post vague enough, because I have seen this bs in many other discussions in this subreddit and irl.

This is just a thought game and a very lazy one.*

# I) Right Wing program (with Neoliberal characteristics) :

\- Restore the Presidential regime. End the power sharing between the ""three presidents"".

\- Privatize as many public companies as possible. Allow foreign firms to establish themselves in **new free economic zones** devoid of Tunisian cumbersome legislation with competitive labor and financial costs. Subject national firms (STEG/SONEDE/STT) to international competition. Destroy the old febrile UGTT and replace it with dispatched local Labour Unions across the country, freeing the Individual from heavy and corrupt institutions.

\- Deregulate financial sector and labour markets. Lift barriers to investments, business opening and employment.

\- Deploy the Army to : 1- force workers in Gafsa to get back to work. 2- destroy informal markets and subject the middle-class to heavy taxation to pay foreign debts, increase Dinars value, and accumulate capital for further investments in new technologies and infrastructure.

\- Encourage foreign firms to delocalize their assembly line in Tunisia, build other plants or research centres, e.g.  car, communication, high-tech and medical companies.

\- Increase Industrial production : the brains and infrastructure are here, we know how to make high-value industrial components, we can and must make more.

\- Tax reduction for employers and entrepreneurs in highly-valued industries like cheap high quality medical healthcare for foreigners, massive Luxury SPA/Hotels, industrials, etc.

\- Keep salaries and social benefits low for workers, increase production with new technologies and strong corporate leadership. This is is temporary of course. When Tunisia's economy gets stronger, the ""trickle-down"" mechanism will enrich all levels of the social pyramids. Just work hard and be patient for brighter tomorrows. If you work hard enough you may become an entrepreneur as well one day ! Make the Rich and the Poor richer !

\- Death penalty for every individual involved with Terrorist/Islamist groups. Label the Muslim Brotherhood and its affiliates (Enahda) as terrorist organizations. Fight crime with new AI tracking technologies Made in China. Make Tunisia one of the safest/cleanest country in the world to attract tourists and investors. Follow the Singaporean/South Korean model of development.

\- No minimal wage. Drop the Labour laws. We must attract investors and pay our debts.

\- Ratify free trade agreements with China, Europe and the United States (maybe integrate the European Union ?) Specialize and increase Tunisian First sector production for a few commodities,   namely : olive oil, dates and seafood. Get rid of traditional ineffective agriculture practice and modernize production with drought resistant GMOs.

\- Basically, follow the IMF/World Bank development austerity plans to get more loans from them (and a solid grade).

\- Reopen the debate on the National Identity : people won't follow the government of a country they feel they do not belong to.

\-Protect family and Islamic values : criminalize LGBT, post-structuralist, neo-feminists and lib-tards movements to keep good composure with neighbours and satisfy conservative elements in Tunisian society, but keep it cool with foreigners (we want more gay rich tourists/engineers, so maybe open a few informal gay bars in free economic zones ?)

# II) Left Wing program :

\- Reinforce public institutions by opening up more job positions in administration, education and public companies to increase efficiency and relationships with all society stakeholders.

\- Restore the UGTT's past greatness by reinforcing the ""côtisation obligatoire"" for all professions. UGTT will have the Manpower and talent necessary to enforce strict Labour regulations and ensure a strong national labour movement that will guarantee workers' rights, dignity, solidarity and education.

\- Augment salaries, especially for teachers and workers.

\- Restore the ""Cycle Court"" starting from 14 yo. Students willing to pursue a vocational training should be set on the right path as soon as possible, and cultivate their pride to belong to the Nation Builders. They may start working as soon as 16 during their formation as an apprentice.

\- Set up an aggressive Tax legislation : every single Tunisian national abroad or at home will have to declare their revenues to the Fisc and pay a progressive income tax. Anyone with a revenue above 1,5 times the national average revenue will pay 55% in taxes. The top 1% will have to pay 75% in tax and investment revenues.

\- Follow the Cuban model : free high quality healthcare and education for all. Everyone will receive a topnotch education in whatever fields he/she wants to pursue.

\- Make all drugs legal and free to use under condition : consumption shall be under medical supervision in state-sponsored facilities. (except for recreational weed maybe, follow the Dutch model)

\- Support local artisans and small agricultors : resist big Agro and GMOs usage. Increase the use of agroecologist and permaculture models with local drought resistant seeds. Make more land available to young farmers thanks to new desalination plants . Increase food self-sufficiency at all cost by subsidizing it !

\- Try to (slowly) operate a decentralisation process : give more freedom and flexibility to governorates while allowing them to set up their own fiscal system, rendering them more responsible and autonomous. Also, will decrease the risk of corruption.

\- Decriminalize homosexuality and legalize gay marriage. Ensure sexual freedom and birth control to all.

\- Protect local businesses by imposing heavy import taxation.

\- Suppress traditional ""Fatalism"" by investing everything in the individual : by setting him free from all tribal/religious dogmas and attachments, providing him with high quality education, he will find the courage and growth mindset to innovate, undertake challenges and create high value for himself and society. And eventually, all problems will sort themselves out.

\- To fight corruption, informal economy and ensure total fiscal efficiency and transparency for a direct democracy : end payment in cash. All transaction will slowly go virtual.

# III) The Nordic Model : A Combination of Both.

A) What's the Nordic Model ?

A comprehensive welfare state and multi-level collective bargaining based on the economic foundations of social corporatism, with a high percentage of the workforce unionized and a large percentage of the population employed by the public sector (roughly 30% of the work force)

It seems the historical struggle of the working class for a more egalitarian society in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Iceland created a set of highly inclusive institutions that allows for a perfect balance between social justice and free markets (also known as the Third way). These institutions aims partly to enhance individual autonomy, mobility and flexibility in a fast changing environment disrupted by globalization, immigration and a open free market.

Although highly competitive (best countries to do business according to WB), they score the lowest in terms of wage gap and wealth inequality due to the heavy taxation on the 55% highest revenues and solid redistribution of wealth through pensions, social services and free high quality education and healthcare.  The Nordic countries score the highest in the Happiness Index, low corruption Index, financial health and general trust in political institutions.

These highly transparent institutions include a wide range of extremely efficient collaborative Labor Unions and Employers Association (""Patronnat"") who negotiate TOGETHER the wages and workers' benefits , with the mediation of the state. Unlike in France or Tunisia where Unions are mostly used as tools of brute contestation, the Nordic syndicates provides efficient communication tools, free education for adults in their reconversion process, career consulting, cultural centres and so on.

They do not have social workers. They abhor the French ""Nanny State"" apparatus and their monstrous bureaucracy policing and surveying citizens to determine which deserves such and such social benefits. The simplicity of their concept is as follow : everyone gets free stuff. Free education (childcare, primary, secondary, trade school) at all ages and abilities, free healthcare, and a pension if you are unfit to do any work.

But does it work ?

B) A Model that works.

Conventional wisdom links innovation to wide inequality. The belief is that inequality motivates, by increasing both the risk and potential reward, attracting talented people who love adventure.

The bold ones make the breakthroughs that propel invention and innovation. It sounds reasonable. Three researchers at the London School of Economics examined that patent filings in Sweden a so called ""nanny-state"", had more patent filings per resident than the United States for most of the last half-century. The advocates of inequality invokes the concept of meritocracy. They point to the olden days in the United States when high rates of upward mobility showed that the poor with talent and grit found the country a land of opportunity... but studies have shown that mobility and equality actually increased freedom and entrepreneurial spirit.

There is something in Denmark and Norway that they call ""Flexicurity"" :

If the business you own can no longer compete in the world market, it's fine with Norwegian government and Labor Unions for you to close it and lay off your workers. Flexicurity means the Government has a social contract with those laid-off workers to do everything possible to help them land a new job that's just as good or better for them. Your unproductive capital becomes available for a new start-up.

Rates of start-up creation in Norway are among the highest in the developed world, and Norway has more entrepreneurs per capita than the United-States. Same for Denmark, Canada and Switzerland.

By investing as  much as possible in the Individual, the Nordic countries has created nations of independent, self-motivated problem solvers with high skills and high self-esteem.

Nordic Workers are among the most productive and efficient : they work 359 hours less than Americans (lowest in the OECD countries) and still have a higher GDP per capita. They also get one month of paid vacation per year and 18 months of paid parental leave. Full evidence that social benefits does not curtail innovation and production, but rather INCREASES them.

C) How did it happen ?

Social-democrats parties and coalitions ruled for centuries and managed to stay out of the marxist/capitalists ideological wars. They established a ""consensual democracy"", where both parties, the owners and workers, managed to keep their rights for property and decent working conditions. They COLLABORATED to induce perpetual innovation in all sectors in order to remain competitive in an increasingly globalized world. They did not choose to cut themselves out of the global market by increasing import taxes, but by increasing innovation. And it worked !

Cooperatives are prevalent. Less likely to fail. Also turnover in co-ops averages 15% against the industry standard of 40 to 60%. The housing co-ops created  750 000 apartments with 860 000 members in Sweden. Parents co-ops provide between 10-15 % of day-care centers.

&amp;#x200B;

D) The Neoliberal experience

In the 80's, two countries the Nordics held in high regards (UK and USA) started implementing their new Neo-Liberal policies : unrestrained by the law, private banks were now free to sell any kind of securities to anyone, disregarding their long term solvability or not. Taxes were lowered for the top earners, workers wages and administrative jobs were cut. We know the results : successive financial crashes in the 90's and the 2008 crisis.

In Iceland, a small nation of 350 000 people, a few private Banks tinkered hard with Neolib tendencies : they sold highly volatile bonds to British Citizens and set up a Ponzi scheme that blew up after the sub-prime crisis. What happened next ? Usually, the IMF-pressurized Governments applied austerity measures. They make the average citizen pay for the irresponsible behaviours of some private Hedge Fund managers. But Iceland did not. They let their bankers down and refused to pay the British their money back, after 10 000 people (5% of the population) went down the capital city to protest the 30% cut in Social Service. Same for Norway and Sweden : they did not follow the IMF plan and kept up with this strategy : increase taxes on the rich, reduce taxes on the working class, force banks to write off mortgages for householders under the water. They even strengthened their social safety nets !

From all OECD countries, The Nordics, (including Iceland who suffered the most from this ordeal) recovered the fastest from the crisis.

E) Comparison with the Anglo-Saxon Model

Soviets and Capitalists justify maintaining high level of poverty reassuring their 99 per cent that the sacrifice would pay. ""Communist rule will one day shower you with goods and services"" or ""A rising tide lifts all boats"" (in the US)

Among 32 OECD countries, the ten most equal countries include Denmark, Norway, Iceland and Swede. The United states are among the five most unequal along with Turkey and Mexico.

F) Can we apply the Nordic model in Tunisia ?

It has been said regularly that applying the Nordic approach in other non-Scandinavian countries was impossible because...different culture/mindset. The Nordics are supposedly more united linguistically, racially homogenous, have a religion that promotes hard-work, individualism, responsibility and so on...

It's half-true. If you get a glimpse of Norway history you'll realize :

\- They got colonized by Denmark for centuries, had 100 different dialects (villagers set  200 m apart could not understand each other because of mountain chains).

\- Were controlled by capitalists overlord who tried to fund some fascist coup to stay in power.

\- Only 3% of the land was fit for agriculture.

\- They did not have much natural resources except for some fish and logging. They were extremely poor and backward compared to other industrialized economies. So they had to invest everything in sea trade and had thousands of experience doing it.

\- They could have emulated the Soviet revolution since there were many powerful red movements ...but fearing to loose their properties, the party of farmers opted for a cooperative model, rather than a collectivist one. This set the tone for a long history of inclusive institutions, ensuring constant bargain between work and capital.

But it wasn't easy. It was a constant struggle. For decades, inequalities rose as the economic elite resisted change for a while.

Eventually, they created a visionary movement that grew, engaged in struggle, attracted allies and won. By winning non-violently.  This is the power of political association and cooperation between all fractions in a society.

The Nordics were not smarter or more skilled than Tunisians. Their working class simply managed to get more power because they were more independent.

Tunisians have been living in servitude for most of their existence. There is no national union, or common goals, although Movements like the ""Jeunes Tunisiens"" or Neo-Destour managed to bring up some reforms like women liberation and education for all, the civil society is not strong enough.  People are strangers to each other and do not trust their institutions.

But this can change. Slowly, thanks to new technology, social benefits can be distributed much quicker without the need for tens of thousands of social workers or labour lawyer.

It didn't take 10 000 years for the Papus to transition from the stone age to the post-industrial age. Only 30 years. I don't think we'll have to wait 100 years like the French to get a more inclusive government (not necessarily democratic. Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, all reached top-level development under dictatorships. Maybe we'll have to go through a technocratic stage with strong governance at the beginning.)",,,,,,2021-02-08 13:53:16

lfea3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/lfea3h/help_hard_drive_replacement/,3,Help: Hard drive replacement,"TLDR: OP willing to clone a dying hard drive and seeking advice considering that only Seagate hard drives (crap) are being sold in Tunisia.  


Ok so hi Tunisian hardware junkies and tech-savvies,

I would've asked this elsewhere but the problem is more or less local.   
I'm wrapping up my PhD at the moment, a stressful period and all, the cherry on top is figuring out that my hard drive, containing very sensitive data generated over 4y, is dying (sector reallocation is on the rise, at a fast pace). This is not my first rodeo which is why I noticed the problem before a catastrophe occurred (already lost a drive and only managed to save about 125 gigs out of about 800) but I digress.  


  
I  backed up what I could save, in case things go south; and the drive is still alive and kicking so that's still good news. I've also been in touch with a local tech repair expert (who was the one who managed to save some of my work before). The solution we agreed to was to clone the data into a brand new hard drive and call it a day.  


This is where it gets a bit spicey because with the COVID19, apparently there has been a shortage of hard drive shipments or whatnot, and the only laptop internal hard drives available in all distributor stores are from the brand Seagate which is not only reputable for having crappy failure rates but what makes it worse is that you are likely getting a recycled drive if you get one of those. I'm tempted to get an SSD but in good conscience, I cannot live above my means budget-wise and the data I'm using is too big for a small size SSD so an SSD is out the question until I get back on my feet financially.  


So I'm here asking whether someone has an idea out of the box for how I should proceed from here. I've been told that I should call and ask distributors about the guarantee of the drives (3 months guarantee means that the drive is 100% recycled and all...) but that got me a bit paranoid for those offering 3 years because trust is lost. Should I take a leap of faith and hope a seagate drive won't lifen't within 5 months of heavy use or anyone got another idea?

I am literally scared to endure another experience with the police’s brutality. 

Last time I was a student who was arrested just because it happened to have incidents in a soccer game in a nearby stadium so the police had to fill its pipeline of criminals to make reports and look they did their job by arresting many people. I was not even in the stadium ! After months in court I could resume my studies in university and become an engineer , but today I cannot afford another downturn for my life or my career just because a poor judgment of corrupted policemen.

I thought 2011 was the year where Tunisians cannot be afraid of oppression anymore , but it looks some of our politicians like to make the police a monster again. 

Today, you cannot say no to a policeman if he stops you in the street asking you for money, or wants to take a cab for free, or even insulting you openly, because they are protected against any lawsuit and they have unions (imagine the only armed people in the country are unionised.. what a risk).

The existence of an undeniable wave of antitheism , among social media influencers, users, mass media and every single tool of internet communication, is being daily remarked, and is gaining public attention, especially within the young generation, blaming religion for the underdevelopment of their countries, and for every crisis they do face. It is accurate to remark , that these very people who claim that Religion itself is the root problem of their societies, have more things in common with modern feminists that an actual improver, they share their dogmatic hatred for a particular thing without much further analysis and critical thinking. These people hardly present any other idea except annihilating all religious activities, to satisfy their imperative loathing towards religion, which is more likely to have psychological reasons and family issues rather than conclusions made after deep thinking",,,,,,2021-02-09 20:08:03

For all its faults Tunisia is truly one of the most diverse, naturally beautiful places on earth with a rich history and amazing culture. Having said that I would say my favourite thing is definitely the landscape and attractions, we have desert, snow, mountains, plains, ocean, islands and urban areas, and on top of that we have some of the best historical landmarks in the world representing our Roman, Phoenician, Imazighen and Arab identity (think el djem, dougga, traditional dwellings in Matmata, Carthage, Kairouan, Kerkuane), we have 8 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, we are a tiny country compared to our neighbours with a small population yet we produce so many famous international musicians, some huge names in football and other sports, we successfully evicted one of the world's strongest ever empires from our land, toppled a dictatorship, most people speak minimum 3 fuckin languages and to be honest I think we are the most underrated country in the world. 

I love Tunisia, we have a lot of problems that need addressing but negativity breeds negativity and I know a lot of us are sick of only hearing the bad things. 

What is your favourite thing about Tunisia?

Edit: love all the positivity, this is Tunisian greatness and warms my heart, I hope you all prosper and contribute to making our country the truly amazing and special place that it is and can become.

lk8ztm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/lk8ztm/questions_autour_de_la_conversion_a_lislam/,9,Questions autour de la conversion a l'Islam,"Salut,

Je suis Français, marie depuis plusieurs années a une Tunisienne. Mes parents, bien qu'issus de familles plutôt catholiques ont coupe les ponts avec la religion et je n'ai jamais vraiment reçu d’éducation religieuse. Aujourd'hui, je me décrirais comme agnostique. Malgré tout, je caresse l’idée d'effectuer ma conversion a l'Islam, pour de multiples raisons, pas forcements liées les unes aux autres:

1. Par volonté d’intégration. J'ai beau venir en Tunisie chaque année et m’intéresser activement a la culture Tunisienne, il y a toujours un fossé qui me sépare des gens que je rencontre. Ce fossé n'est pas seulement celui de la religion, évidemment. Il y a une *foule* d'autres choses. Mais la religion en est l'une des composantes.
2. En hommage a ma belle-mère décédée, croyante, et qui aurait je crois été comblée que je devienne musulman. Je pense que cela ferait aussi très plaisir a mon beau-père, bien que l'on n'ait jamais aborder la question, et qu'il soit croyant sans être pratiquant. 
3. Pour des raisons politiques. Depuis des années, j'assiste a la marginalisation et a la stigmatisation de la communauté musulmane en France. Je vois en la conversion un manière de marquer mon opposition au racisme et a l'islamophobie ambiante dans mon pays d'origine.

Voila pour les raisons. Maintenant je me pose aussi pas mal de questions:

* d'un point de vue pratique, comment effectue-t-on sa conversion en Tunisie? Dois-je prendre des cours? A qui m'adresser?
* Le principe fondamental de l'islam c'est l'affirmation de l'existence et de l’unicité de Dieu. En ce que me concerne, je ne crois pas vraiment en Dieu. J'aimerais me convertir pour des raisons culturelles, affectives, et politiques. Moralement, serait-ce irrespectueux? Je ne le pense pas, car je pense que ma conversion et motivée par de bonnes intentions. Mais j'aimerais vos avis.
* Devrais-je être honnête avec la personne qui effectuera ma conversion sur mes motivations, et sur le fait que je ne crois pas particulièrement a l'existence de Dieu?
* Que dois-je connaître de la religion pour effectuer ma conversion dans de bonnes conditions? J'ai une assez bonne idée de l'histoire et de la doctrine islamique, mais je ne connais aucune sourate, je ne sais pas prier, etc.
* Avez-vous des conseils, ou des ressources a partager?

Merci d'avance!",,,,,,2021-02-15 08:04:17

I am a 26y/f with an ongoing career and I went into the experience to create a system for myself since I just moved from Tunis to Sousse, to settle and get used to the situation and have new skills. Most of my cohort mates were unfortunately unemployed for a while and were hoping to acquire an employable skill that would get them hired. Most of us were complete beginners, I personally just downloaded some Javascript games and did not prepare that much beforehand and that is fine. I went into the experience with reasonable expectations, I was just happy to learn new skills and meet new people, I like learning about technologies and I was very excited.

Nonetheless, the instructors were just as newbies as we are, and we quickly found out the school actually hires most of the students back to avoid getting backlash. Everyone is hiding behind the ""do it yourself"" and ""learn by doing"" motos. I am a self-learner and I enjoy challenges and I do make sure I researched every solution possible and asked my team mates before I went to an instructor, yet they completely ignore you or try to blow you off. They have a very specific script that the staff uses to answer everything and turn everything back on you which disgusted me honestly, I just abhor the feeling of discovering I was being gaslighted.

Things became really bad, when the instructors left halfway through the bootcamp to get a job and they were replaced by very recent graduates. I could not take it anymore and made a very lengthy and detailed complaint to the main office in Tunis which was cosigned by my team.

They tried to make things up by adding some catch up sessions online that were basically copies from youtube tutorials. Everyone was very disheartened and lost motivation to learn. They even added a clause that said instructors can close checkpoints without warning and can allocate any grade to you they see fit. Imagine being graded by new graduates that can not answer your questions!

I went to the facebook page to see reviews only to find the positive ones , which were unsurprisingly made by the staff of Gomycode as I recognized the name of one of the founders and a lot of the education counselors..

It's crazy how from the outside, it just looks like the one negative comment is from someone who was not smart enough, or did not try hard enough to learn and I think this is part of the reason people are still applying to the school.

I am more than halfway through my final project and I am so tired of fighting for my rights. Why is it so much to ask for qualified instructors who can answer questions? I just recently saw pictures of the demo day on the manager's LinkedIn profile only to see one of the previous instructors smiling holding his certificate...he was not even a graduate when he was brought out to teach.

علاش قاعد نترانا .. وشنوة مازلت نعمل .. وعلاش قاعد نضحي في التضحيات هذه الكل؟؟

وصلت للمرحلة هذه بعد سنوات طويييلة من التعب والتضحية من أجل اني نكون رياضي مثالي .. كنت نغيب على قرايتي ونقرق بالاساتذة بش نجم نسكر 9/9 حصص تدريب .. حياتي كانت فيها حاجة وحدة وماغير مبالغة .. الكاراتي ...

التضحية هذه ما مشاتش حرام .. ونجحت اني نفك بلاصتي في أصناف الشبان والأكابر ونجيب الذهب لتونس في بطولة العالم (الأولى في تاريخها فردي) والذهب زادة ثلاثة مرات في بطولة أفريقيا والألعاب الإفريقية ...

شنوة لقيت مقابل هذا؟؟ حتى شيء بخلاف شوي تصاور ودعوات الإعلام بش نحكي شوي ويقولولي يعطيك الصحة ونروح ..

اليوم احنا في 2021 وحتى بريماتي لتو ماخذيتهم .. ماعنديش الحق نفرح بإنجازاتي؟؟ رضينا بالظروف الدنيا الي أندادي في الدول الأخرى عندهم عشرات أضعافها .. وهي ما رضاتش بينا ..

عمري 21 عام ومع ذلك ترتيبي في التصنيف العالمي في ميزاني 26 عالميا بعد ما لعبت عام واحد أكابر وماخرجتش في شطر les opens الي ناخذوا بيهم نقاط .. شنوة يسوى هذا؟؟ مانجم كان نفخهم ونشرب ماهم.

القطاع الخاص ما يشجعش ماعنديش علاش نلومه هذيكة العقلية .. والدولة هل يحقلها ما تكونش عند كلمتها ؟؟

تعرفوا شمعناها رياضي محترف؟ يعني رياضي مسخر حياته الكل لرياضته .. أي مقابل شنوة؟؟؟ تحتى بريماتي الي هي حقي بالتعاقد بيني وبين الوزارة ما فرحتش بيها؟

زعمة الوقت الي مسخره لو مشيت خدمت بيه حتى المرمة ما كانش يكون العائد متاعه أفضل؟؟

 فقدت كل رغبة في اني نتدرب .. وولى التدريب بالنسبة لي مضيعة متاع وقت .. حاولت نكون الرياضي المثالي الي ما يتكلمش وما يشكيش لكن هذاكة حد الجهيد ...

يبدو الوقت قرب بش الواحد يفيق على روحه ويمشي يتعلم صنعة والا يدبر خدمة .. بلادنا ماهيش متاع حلم .. بلادنا ماهيش متاع رياضة ... شنوة مستقبلي بعد الجري واللهيط هذا الكل؟؟؟  كنت مبرمج مانعتزل كان كيف البدن ماعادش يجاوب .. أما يبدو انه العقل والقلب بش يسبقوا البدن ...

llcem6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/llcem6/victims_of_law_52/,47,📢 victims of law 52 📢,"This is the story of two young men. One of them is my younger brother Kacem Ben Issa, the other is his childhood best friend, Medamine Touati.
Kacem and Mohamed Amine are both 22 years of age and were a year younger when they were detained by the Tunisian police. The story began on the 17th March 2020 when they both were heading towards the city of Sousse in order to spend some time together and have some fun, unfortunately for them the circumstances were not fit and they had to head back home in the capital Tunis because the government announced a curfew due to the COVID-19 situation. Kacem and Mohamed Amine had some money with them that they were going to squander in their little ""vacation"". That money came from Mohamed Amine's work as a photographer and some of it came from my brother's work in a call center. They also had some cannabis on them, which as all we know was reclassified by the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) as a less harmful drug and decided to remove it from Schedule IV of the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs — where it was listed alongside specific deadly, addictive opioids, including heroin. In Tunisia though, cannabis is still considered a major crime and consumers are usually seen as criminals. Kacem and Mohamed Amine are amongst the calmest and kindest people you could ever meet. Everyone who knows them personally would confirm that without hesitation. My brother is a university student who was studying arts before the arrest. His friend was studying to become a professional press photographer. These two young men have already been through a lot, having spent a whole year in custody where they do not belong and their dreams and ideas are being slowly but surely crushed and turned into nightmares. On 12th February 2021 they have sadly both been officially sentenced to a six-year in prison and one can only imagine what would six years in prison amidst real criminals would make them. What would they become? And what would be the ideas they come out with? That’s if they manage to survive the ordeal.
This is a desperate call for any human empathy in order to help these two young men along with many others like them whose lives and their families’ lives are being destroyed because of the infamous Tunisian 1992 Narcotics Act (Act 92-52). Tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of mostly young people’s lives are being destroyed in our country for the mere possession or personal use of cannabis. We are in deep anguish, distress and miserably asking for any help.

lm03j4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/lm03j4/unpopular_opinion/,6,Unpopular opinion,"Tunisians have a weird ""preferences snobism"" that is taken very seriously which  I do not get , at all. 

Examples: I listen to metal and only metal, all other music is garbage, if you listen to other types you are garbage too.

I watch friends and Netflix, I would never watch soap opera or Turkish series. If you watch them you are a superficial piece of shit.

This one surprises me the most: If you eat spicy food , you are unrefined and probably not from a well-off background. It almost shocks me that it's a thing.

It's a preference, an opinion, a difference.  It's not that deep. I met some people who are overall superficial but I do not know if their preferences are the main reason. Character is defined by many factors other than form of entertainment. It's the shit you face in life, you values, your actions. 

 I don't know what's worse sometimes, having underdeveloped interests and no personality or basing an entire personality on music , tv show and food taste.

 Is this the millennial form of football fanatism?",,,,,,2021-02-17 17:44:00

Also, if the package comes and I happen to miss the delivery, will it be automatically put in the post office?

The less fortunate of us have fallen prey to the indoctrination of the mass media outlets we have. Yet it is all personal gains; undermining the democratic foundation that we had established, abuse of power, conflicts of interests... These are just some of the titles that could describe the current governmental body. Per contra, whilst this is a serious issue, I behold Tunisia's first enemy for the economic crime the one, The Tunisian General Labour Union. The malversation of their actions has collectively halted our strong nation from meeting its true potential and initiating the hockey stick boom that we all have awaited. A bunch of mobsters, if we had a better financial structure, Noureddine Tabboubi woulda rose to be the next Jimmy Hoffa of Tunisia, regarding the nature of his after-hours activities. This single organization led to losses in astronomical numerical values relative to Tunisia due to conflicts that oppose personal gains. We give so much power to one single entity; we helped create an unstoppable position of power. Today, the highest office of power in Tunisia is no longer the president that we all have voted for; it is one person backed by lobbyists with so much power to stop the interworkings of a country, to appoint, change and manipulate who rises to certain positions. yet the villain disguises himself as the savior, the messiah, and ironically the Hero, promising so much for the youths and the marginalized segments of our society. he says ""Power in unity.. we will make a better life for all of us""...

Because comparing what islam teaches and what tunisians put into practice is almost null. For instance, althought prophet muhammad said that prayer is the most important thing and from what i know when someone doesn't pray he is unmuslim. especially that adding that the ones that actually implement the islamic teaching are called extrimest , witch is totaly wrong ( i am talking about the dudes that have long beards and go to the mosque usualy and are very polite people and claim to not do any immorality)",,,,,,2021-02-23 10:32:21

So my sister politely explained that she is not wearing it because her fellow male classmates are not wearing it , the next day when she was in class my sister got kicked out from class for not wearing the uniform by her “madania” teacher ( how ironic lmao) and when her teacher asked her why she is not wearing it my sister explained that she wants everyone to wear it and pulled up “ النضام الداخلي"" and “ الفصل العشرين من الدستور التونسي"" to support herself, despite that the teacher kicked her out and told her “ برا اشكي بينا، و كان مش عاجبك برا رود روحك طفل"" ( sue us and if you don’t like you can turn yourself into the boy ) ; of course adding to that telling her to shut up and yelling at her (سكر فمك) ; and threatening her by saying (تو تشوف شنوة باش يصيرلك) ،so idk how to deal with this ? What law suits should I do , is it profiling based on sexism  because they only chose to kick my 12 years old sister even if her male classmates or is it verbal abuse and threat because of what her teacher said

You are asked to read predefined sentences and record them. This helps computers to understand more languages. Currently there are 81 hours of Arabic language recordings. For comparison English and Kinyarwanda already have 1700 hours of recorded audio.

To help you need to register yourself with an email address. Then you can record predefined sentences straight away. (And also listen back to confirm recordings)

I'm not affiliated with the project I just want the dataset to grow to make it possible build more accessible machine learning algorithms.

If you have any questions, I'm happy to try answer them :)

I’m a Tunisian first-time poster and lurker in this community!

I’m trying to acquire a plot of land of 1 hectare in a rural area to make a small dream home in it.
I’m the only working person in my (middle-class) family and really want my mother and I to have a home of our own for good at some point in our lives.

Might there be anyone who has experience with acquiring a similar kind of real-estate, home-building, working with an architect at all or not?

I would love to have your advice on the following:

-1)any things to look out for when looking at plots, specific to Tunisia?
I’d love to have a hillside home but I don’t know if that, too, might shoot the prices even further up the roof (because sceptic tanks, electricity and driveway connection...and speaking of connection, is cable internet even remotely a possibility at all?)

-2)what are the average fees when you work with an architect in Tunisia to design and oversee your house from scratch to finish?
For a contemporary house for example (as in not traditional, not pre-made, not a container house)

Random note I feel like sharing: I’d really love to make a home that also respects nature as much as possible, even going as far as to building around/integrate any trees within the house plan. We have way too much concrete and not enough nature here so, I’d hate to cut down any trees 😅

Thanks so much in advance for your time and kind advice!",,,,,,2021-03-12 09:53:23

m498jl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/m498jl/how_african_do_you_feel/,9,How African do you feel?,"First off obviously Tunisia is geographically African, having said that, we speak an Afro-Asiatic language (but so does the Horn of Africa), as opposed to Nilo-Saharan, Niger-Congo or Chadic etc, we are culturally unique but heavily influenced by the Mediterranean and Middle East, and including the other Maghreb nations, also ethnically distinct from any other population on earth, but somewhat related to people's from the Arabian Peninsula and Horn of Africa. I have met many Tunisians who disregard their 'Africaness' and seem kind of confused identity wise, I think people assume because the majority of us aren't what the West considers Black, we aren't as African as 'sub-saharans' (I hate this term), yet rarely is the Africaness of Somalis, Ethiopians, Eritreans and Djiboutians questioned despite the fact they are typically more mixed with Arabs (and Maghrebis), than North Africans are. 

Personally I consider myself 100% African, culturally, ethnically, geographically, i don't think it's for Europeans or Pan-Africansexcludingthenorth to decide whether I am African or not and I personally feel more affinity with other non-Maghrebi Africans than with Middle Easterners or Southern Europeans, but that is me.

What do you all think, do you consider Tunisia only geographically 'African'? Do you think we should be more pan-African or do you prefer a closer relation with the Middle East or Southern Europe? I think we are a lot better off working together to make Africa better for all Africans I think more Tunisians and Maghrebis should embrace their Africaness, we come from the most diverse continent on earth it's very ignorant to assume Africa='Black' especially when there is greater genetic difference between a Nigerian and a Chadian or a Tunisian and an Egyptian, than there is between a Spaniard and a Irishman.

3. Are there any traver agencies/tourist information points operating. We want to go on a 3 day trip into the desert, but we read on forums that it's only half the price if we book locally. This also means the locals are the ones profiting from it, instead of the european travel agencies.

When person in country A wants to send money to person in country B, they don't really transfer the money, they just make person in country A send to TransferWise's bank account in country A and TransferWise sends the amount in their bank account in country B to the person in country B.

I'm a non-resident, non-citizen hoping to travel to Tunisia for a few months in late-may ish to do some research. However, it is super unclear to me from which countries it is currently possible to travel to Tunisia as a non-resident+non-citizen (in effect, as a tourist). I'm an EU citizen so I qualify for 90 days visa free.

This ([http://www.santetunisie.rns.tn/images/classification\_23\_09\_2020.pdf](http://www.santetunisie.rns.tn/images/classification_23_09_2020.pdf)) is the only list I have managed to find of countries, and it was the one that applied when I last traveled to Tunisia in September last year, but it hasn't been updated since then afaik. Is there another list? Is this not in effect anymore? What is in effect? I'm basically invested enough in this trip to be willing to travel to a random country and stay there for a few weeks in order to then travel from there to Tunis - that's why I'm asking where to find this information.

mbmbvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/mbmbvj/racism_in_tunisia/,6,Racism in Tunisia,"I am a 23 year old, white english man. I visited Hammamet in 2018. I have only good things to say about my time in Tunisia. The local people I came into contact both inside and outside of the resort I was staying in were pleasant and seemed genuinely happy to have me stay in their country. I enjoyed leaving the resort and seeing the medina and going for a camel ride that was organised via the resort. All in all I can say it was fun and I do plan on returning. 

However I noticed a few things regarding race, that made me pause for thought. I am a white man, very pale. For me racism has never impacted me. Everywhere I have been I have been afforded respect and kindness. My race has either privileged me or has never honderd me. However one time when I was in Tunisia, I was about to go on a resort organised camel ride about 15 mins drive from the resort hosted in a small farm. While waiting at the resort I met a group of other English people. They were black, and hailed from London. I got talking with them and they to were going to ride camels. When our organised transport arrived, myself and my girlfriend (both white) were treated to a rather impressive Mercedes to ride in. The black group was given a tuc-tuc type of truck that went about 20mph. We all laughed and wondered how such a dangerous looking transport was being used. Me and my girlfriend arrived at the farm a good 15/20 mins before the black group and I wondered was it a simple coincidence that we were treated to the luxury of the Mercedes and they the tuc-tuc or was it a purposeful decision. This wasn’t the only thing that made me thought of racism. I remember heading to the airport from the resort and seeing billboards with very light skinned Tunisians but never dark skinned Tunisians that reflect the majority of the Tunisian people I saw. I wondered why this veneration for light skinned and not the colour that most Tunisians are? 

I wonder if you any of you have had similar experiences? or am I overthinking this?",,,,,,2021-03-23 19:14:45

I am starting to believe that for a successful democratic transition a powerful middle class is required. What most Arab countries lack is a strong middle class who run the economy with their businesses. If the people can't afford to import their essential needs with their own money and instead rely on a fragile government to take foreign loans to import essentials then that's problematic. Imports exceed exports and a huge portion of the population rely on public jobs to make a living while the fragile government has to pay those public sector employees from foreign loans as well, that includes the police. If the civil population aren't paying the police from their own money then they don't really have leverage over them right? After all the police are employees and they answer to their employer, if the government is taking loans to pay them then they answer to the government not the people.   
I think that to fix the Tunisian economy the people need to engage in businesses that bring foreign currency to the country to help the economy grow. The culture of relying on the government to provide jobs and pay higher salaries is going to destroy the economy and make living conditions much worse in the future.

Explaining that I am writing a travel guide (in English), or that je suis ici pour écrire un guide de voyage / un guide touristique tends to result in confusion. 90% of the time people hear ""guide touristique"" and assume that I am a guide, scoping out future locations to bring my tour groups to, which is not correct.

I am a Canadian, but one of my good friends and colleagues is Tunisian. She recently returned to Tunisia to see her father, who had been hospitalized for covid. Regrettably, she was unable to clear quarantine before he passed. Her brother is now on a ventilator for the same reason, and she is emotionally devastated.

I'm wracking my brain for something I can do to help her from afar. Flowers seem a bit trite, considering her circumstances. The best I can come up with is perhaps a gift card for UberEats (or some other food delivery service) so she at least won't have to worry about cooking while she is grieving. If I were there, I'd cook food and bring it to her, but obviously that's not really feasible.

Can anyone help me out by telling me what are the popular food delivery apps in Tunis? Or, if you have any other ideas for what I can do to help support her? I'm not sure of the cultural norms for mourning. If it helps, she is a practicing Muslim.",,,,,,2021-03-26 13:43:24

I'm 20 years old , na9ra bac w basically i'm asking you people to advice me on the biggest life decision i'm going to make .

So that'a hella of an introduction 😅 but let's get right into it

So basically i assume many people here either have heard of the SAT test or passed it or know someone who did .

It's mainly an exam all students in American high schools are required to take if they want to join college (like the bac exam here) and it's required for international students who are willing to apply for us colleges too .

My main dilemma is that as i said na9ra bac and the exams starts exactly on june 16 (I'm doing fine in my studies I'm currently having a study schedule that I'm sticking to it so things are going pretty well i guess )

But the problem is when it comes to the SAT test or should i say :

Preparing for it with the bac exam in a TIME PERIOD OF 1 MONTH

(the final deadline of applying to SAT is literally about 8 days from now and i still didn't apply for it )

So this is my question :

Should i ditch the idea of passing the SAT and focus on my bac exam or should i pass both of them ?

Some helpful details :

*Sat test consists of two main parts :
Math section : 800 points
Reading section : 800 points 
So basically the test is rated on 1600 points .

*Na9ra bac math so i can prepare for the math part of the test i guess it won't bother me so much 

*I know it's a question of priority so to be clear enyy nokhrej men tounes is a top 1 priority for me than getting a good score in my bac exam and study at a good Tunisian universty",,,,,,2021-03-29 14:32:02

mks0nq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/mks0nq/tunisians_have_had_some_strokes_of_luck_in_their/,52,Tunisians have had some strokes of luck in their history/geography (Monday optimism shot),"I’m not one of those people who’d go out of their way to see Tunisia as not the dysfunctional place as it is. Nor do I ever have any of the embarrassing superiority complex episodes that some of our countrymen have. I’m quite realistic about where we are in the world and the rot that’s within our institutions  and to an extent, many of our people. 

So, I wanted to establish that. I’m no nationalist or any of that crap.

However, there are many elements in our country that make us lucky, in particular when compared to most African as well as Middle Eastern countries. These are things we take for granted, but I think that, if we look at the experiences of our neighbors and fellow-Arabic speakers, we have a few perks. Some points even apply to places outside of MENA and Africa. 

1. Religious homogeneity. This is coming from a non-religious person so please don’t assume I’m putting Sunni Islam on a pedestal. However, Tunisians being primarily born to families who follow that same faith is a relief. The Shia/Sunni divide caused mayhem in every single country in which these two groups coexisted each in significant proportions. You can also extend this idea to Catholicism/Protestantism (think Ireland) and mixtures of Islam and Christianity. I would love a world in which practicing people know how to live with others, but the reality isn’t that. And Tunisians are spared this drama. PS: I think the second largest belief system in Tunisia is agnosticism/atheism, and for obvious reasons they’re not making fusses. 

2. The absence of a sense of ethnicity. We don’t really categorize ourselves in terms of ethnicity, and if we do, we don’t think our Tunisian society is composed of multiple ones but rather of a singular Arab/Amazigh whatever you wanna call it unit. Surely we’re not color blind and some of us are racists, but we do not put Tunisian people in ethnic boxes. Think of the Tutsi/Hutu or the Arab/Kurdish bloodshed. We have no clear ethnic divides. 

3. We are not tribal. Not in the sense Libya or KSA or Jordan are tribal. We have our regionalism and our 3rouchet but it’s nothing like tribe mentality that can even pit people against each other in political events and lead to strife. 

4. Linguistic homogeneity. Yes, French is still a pain in our collective ass. Some speak it better than others and some use it to differentiate themselves in class and social standing (those are a small Marsa minority and it’s not that consequential). Some folks in the south maintained the Amazigh language of their ancestors but that hasn’t lead to serious separatist drama. Everyone speaks Tunisian and knows some MSA. No region has a strong enough affiliation with a non-majority language that lead it to want special rights or independence. Our neighbors do have issues relating to linguistic differences: Kabylie (Algeria) is one example. There are more examples in Europe (Flemish, Basque). And again, I’m not assuming diversity is inherently problematic but it does often lead to friction and that’s how the real world is. I believe separatism can be very dangerous and it’s lucky we don’t have to deal with it. 

5. No hostile neighbors or territorial/ressource disputes. This is quite relevant in the MENA and Africa contexts. Egypt is in conflict with Ethiopia over the Nile. Syria still has (albeit dormant) aspirations to re-absorb Lebanon. Algeria and Morocco’s feud is alive and well. It seems to me that every second country in the area has some border/resource drama with a nearby country. We don’t have anything serious of the sort. Our national borders are unquestioned, clear cut and taken as legitimate by most parties. I did hear grievances about Hassi Masseoud (in relation to Algeria) but that never went anywhere that’s messy. Things are chill. 

These are my two cents. These things cheer me up, truly, whenever I think about Tunisia. They are in our makeup and they lead us to have a relatively peaceful and dare I say cohesive society without having to resort to idiotic nationalist rhetoric. I’m aware that they value the very minimum (peace) but so many places don’t have even that.

This is long and boring but I had to share it as I truly believe in it and I wanted people to be exposed to these points as they may put some things in perspective.

Feel free to debate me as I do want to refine my views.",,,,,,2021-04-05 18:57:08
mkton8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/mkton8/another_facebook_data_leak_this_time_tunisia/,7,Another Facebook Data leak. This time Tunisia &amp; France on top of the list," In case you haven’t heard by now, there’s been another huge Facebook data leak, encompassing personal information from more than 533 million Facebook users from 106 countries. This data was posted in a hacking forum, which is to say — if you have a Facebook account, there’s a good chance your data has once again been exposed to hackers including everything from your phone number to your email address, birthday, full name, and more.  However, this time, Tunisia and France are on top of the list. How serious is this? We investigated the issue.

We acquired some of the stolen data so you don't have to (and to satisfy your curiosity ;) )

So, ever since I was young, I've loved making drinks. Any type of drink, whether the different ways to make coffee, tea, etc.

The thing is, i've made two types of indian tea for my mom. whilst making tea, I had an idea, why don't I make every type of drink there is that each country has to offer and serve it to my mom. so far, she's absolutely loving the drinks I'm making her. I love making drinks (and drinking them) in general and it would be a really amazing experience to make each type of drink the world has to offer.

If you could, just write the name of the drink and recipe that you use, that'd be awesome.

One thing to note: we're muslim so please, no drinks with alcohol. if there's a non-alcoholic version to said drink, I'd love to make it.

Thank you in advance :)",,,,,,2021-04-07 09:37:01

When you're born in Tunisia from Tunisian parents you're automatically assigned a muslim identity and I know that the Tunisian social structure acknowledges the existence of non-muslims participating in the economy (for the benefit of tourism i guess). Some places sell pork and alcohol to people with a non-arab passport (some don't check) and many food and coffee places are open during the day in Ramadan. You can even safely and legally gamble.

She’s studying at the same college as me plus she works so we don’t get to interact incredibly often. Sometimes I really want to ask her about her culture and home country, but she often seems very exhausted so I haven’t had the chance to ask her yet. The last thing I want to do is bother her when she’s stressed. 

Anyway, she might be going back to Tunisia soon and I really want to get her something nice. Something that reminds her of the time she had in the States, but is appropriate and respectful to her and her culture. I have no idea where to even started. Any suggestions or tips would be very helpful.

Thank you very much.",,,,,,2021-04-10 13:15:46

So I love historical shows/movies and I'd like to watch some about Tunisia's history (or north africa's). 

It can be fictional or a documentary, both are good for me. 

If possible in the tunisian dialect, or any language but with english or french subtitles. Algerian dialect is also ok for me. I have a lot of difficulties to understand other dialects, same for fuSha so I'd need english (or french) subtitles if so. But if you know a very good show and you don't know if there are subtitles, write it anyway.

I'm currently watching Galb Edhib but I only have 2 episodes left before I finish it and I really like it.

Any suggestion? Thanks!",,,,,,2021-04-16 05:57:49

I’m travelling across Tunisia atm and this past year I was brought closer and closer to Sufism لصُّوفِيَّة‎ٱ (Tasawwuf). Mostly from the gentle and wise words of Llewellyn Vaugh Lee on youtube. 

I’m interested in getting in contact with local sources of sufism knowledge. I’m not a muslim and my French is a bit rudimental although improving :) I’m partaking in this challenging and magical experience which is the Ramadan. 

So I was wondering if someone could point me in the direction of Sufi communities in Tunisia or ways to get further information about it

mukl4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/mukl4y/is_anyone_else_interested_in_translating_tunisian/,47,"Is anyone else interested in translating Tunisian culture (shows, videos, idioms...etc)?","I've been living in English speaking areas of Canada for 6-7 years now, and I don't know if it's not going home for 3 years or generally nostalgia/ghorba, but it's been near impossible to show any Tunisian stuff to friends here or especially romantic partners.

We have our own mix of a culture and it's so hard to summarize it in ""western"" and ""eastern"" and ""middle east"" terms. I can talk forever and try to explain, but I think Tunisian movies and honestly especially shows (as in Choufli Hal and more recently Nouba) carry some Tunisian essence that is neither western, middle-eastern, atheist or muslim (sorry if that's offensive) but it's just Tunisian, from idioms to tones of talking.

I kinda tried, but I can't just watch a Tunisian show, movie or even just podcast/talk show with someone without translating every bit and also the Tunisian nuances and double meanings.

I haven't watched Tunisian romdhan shows in a couple of years but I wanted to this year, and my partner wanted to as well (I also explained the plots in detail and got her excited) and she couldn't believe there's not even automatic translation from french for ANY of the shows.

I wasn't surprised because I know how Tunisian centric these shows are, but they're on YouTube for a reason, and I know for a fact views from North America pay 10-15x compared to Tunisian views, but also it would be so easy to translate these shows costing millions of dinars to English or just French which would auto-translate well to English.

This all might seem selfish, but other than revenue from English speaking Tunisians, you get access to viewers all around the world and especially Middle Eastern viewers who aren't comfortable with Tunisian.

Anyways, I think this should be a thing because it's surprising it's not even translated to French not to mention English when there's millions of Tunisians abroad nowadays.

I'm fully committed to start translating Tunisian artifacts as a whole (shows, movies...anything) to English, so let me know if you're interested as well! I'm sure compensation will naturally follow as well",,,,,,2021-04-20 06:47:24

I just the other day found a new to me school in Tunis, IDS, that's much more affordable and has English as a primary language.  The issue is that they said their secondary school isn't opening until the 2022/2023 year.  So, my question is, is there another middle/high school that I've not been able to find that is more affordable?    I know they are gonna cost more than the Tunisian private schools but 10 to 25 thousand USD is just stupid expensive and more than our entire income.  I'm just hoping that there is another option that's been hiding from me like this IDS has.  Thank you.",,,,,,2021-04-27 03:43:30

First of all, I know this sub isn't exactly about Education and maybe this isn't the right place for asking something like this so if that's the case then I apologize for that.

So yeah, I really need help with my Arabic lesson, I'm in Bac arts (lettre) and I'm struggling with the first lesson we study which is شعر الحماسة للمتنبي and to be frank, I didn't pay much attention at the start of year and I missed a lot of hours so I completely know nothing about this lesson.

So I tried googling explanations for this lesson but it's still complicated for me, my problem is one, reading Mutanabi's poetry is like reading a completely different language, two I'm not really sure about what to do in exam and how to do the تحليل, three it's overall complicated for me.

And what I exactly want is I want to be able to handle the exam if it's based on this lesson, I don't want to give a blank paper ofcourse, it's bac.

So can you guys help me out by perhaps maybe giving me a good explanation to it or maybe link me to somewhere where I can find the explanation I need ? Thanks in advance!",,,,,,2021-04-29 00:53:26

To cope with the third wave of infections, the young Tunisian Republic has announced a series of restrictive measures that will go into effect from 3 to 16 May next***, in addition to those already in existence: the curfew from 10 pm to 5 am, with the ban on using the car from 7 pm, the faculty for governors to apply targeted lockdowns in areas classified as clusters, teamwork in public offices, closed schools and distance learning in universities.

Among the new measures introduced yesterday, the compulsory 7-day quarantine for travelers arriving from abroad, with the obligation of PCR tests, as well as entry between the fifth and seventh day and the prohibition for cafes and restaurants to serve indoors. [**Tunisia** ](https://thearabposts.com/egypts-shoukry-and-tunisian-president-kais-saied-discuss-gerd-last-developments/)has recorded 303,584 registered cases of [**coronavirus** ](https://thearabposts.com/us-announces-60m-covid-19-vaccine-sharing-with-nations-under-duress/)and 10,444 deaths since the outbreak began, but the shortage of hospital beds is worrying, with 92% of resuscitation beds in public hospitals occupied, according to Health Minister Faouzi Mehdi.

The national vaccination campaign, which started on March 13, is proceeding rather slowly, with 345,914 people having received the first dose of vaccine, of which 74,785 also the second, according to data from the Ministry of Health of Tunis. The spokeswoman for the ministry, Nissan Ben Alaya, in announcing the new measures on Wednesday, indicated that **“the health situation is very serious”**, underlining that all the red indicators, especially as regards the number of infections, hospitalized patients and number of deaths.

Government spokeswoman Hasna Ben Slimen, on the other hand, reiterated that the commitment of citizens to respect preventive measures is essential to limit the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. From next May 3, all those who enter Tunisia from abroad, in addition to presenting a negative coronavirus test (PCR), will have to spend a self-quarantine period of seven days at their own expense in a partner hotel, and carry out a second test between the fifth and seventh day.

A decision much criticized by operators in the tourism sector, the main engine of the Tunisian economy, as well as by businessmen and diplomats who complain about the lack of clarity. The spokesperson did not specify whether the measure will be valid for all countries or whether there are exceptions as in the case of Libya, which has so far been excluded from the restrictions, applying a joint health protocol.

***It should be remembered that Tunisia is witnessing the flight of foreign investors and the country is on the verge of economic, political, and social collapse. Observers believe the country will declare bankruptcy by the end of 2021.***

Hello I'd appreciate any help on this matter I can get. Any Americans that have married Tunisian woman would be really helpful on this matter.  I will give just a fast little backstory.   I am an American who accidentally became friends over Facebook with a Tunisian. We did not seek each other out it was by chance we met over a comment section on a video. We did a lot of talking over the months. Eventually we started dating and now are talking marriage.  We already know the process is long and complicated but we're not sure what to expect or the path to follow that will be best for us.  She is okay with coming to live in America so that will be our next goal after marriage.  My question is if we get married in Tunisia, what do we have to do to get her living in the U.S with me? We are in it for the long run but are a little concerned about being apart after getting married.  So are there ways to be together after being married(I have to return to u.s for work), say a tourist visa or another kind of visa, which is better? I've checked the embassy websites for info but would love to hear exactly what others have done in this situation.  I also read some people use services they pay for for help but I'm not entirely sure that's necessary. (Like an attorney) Thank you for any help you can provide.",,,,,,2021-04-30 19:29:40

NO identity, no money, no jobs, no plane, and the scariest of them all NO HOPE. 

Politicians are so corrupt, I think we surpassed Italy! The fuckers don't even believe in democracy or freedom of speech, they are just screaming at each others like wild dogs and the people are clapping, doing the same  (right, left and center) no one actually gives a fuck about Tunisia, a debate or exchanging new ideas.  Everyone thinks that they are the chosen one . 

Crime has peaked  greatly. We were bragging  about our woman rights, and now almost every day we hear about a a girl/woman/boy getting kidnapped or raped. Getting jumped ""braquage"" is as common as snails in the garden on a rainy day. Murders and conspiracies, and lets not talk about terrorism.

Schizophrenia is a plague that  ails the land from the "" Medayen lil Kafer "" I can't even fathom those over the top reactions on Facebook, the fake facades every one puts on and the mob mentality etc...

The economy is collapsing. The middle class has shrunk, poverty is getting worse by the hour, and misery is every where you look.

Are we just going to stay like this without doing anything? Sobbing about past days that we will never get back, about an uncertain tomorrow, and a fogy present.

Unfortunately, I can't delay this return that's happening at a very unfortunate time.

I'm looking for testimonials from people that had to do the hotel quarantine before or that are about to do it now.

Let's all help each other get through this in the safest way possible. I'll keep updating this post with info as I get it.

Questions I have about this:

1. Can booking a hotel be done through online platforms like [booking](https://booking.com).com or expedia ? Or does it have to be done through the numbers/emails given in the listing?  

2. Once in the hotel - were guests restricted to their rooms or could they roam around / use amenities? (I booked Golden Gammarth for this go)
3. Does the government send a team for testing people on day 5-7 of quarantine? Or do you have to book that test in a private lab and break quarantine (leave hotel) to get tested?
4. Are you given a certificate/official paper at the end of the quarantine that proves that you've done it? Or is that not checked on exit?

n4cprl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/n4cprl/starlink_in_tunisia/,4,Starlink in Tunisia,"For those of you who don't know what Starlink is, it's a satellite internet constellation being constructed by SpaceX providing satellite internet access. It is currently in its beta phase and available in only a few select countries. 

In the future, the service will be available worldwide and it will allow people who live in rural areas or countries with no to bad quality internet to take advantage of high speed satellite internet connection, all it takes is to buy the Starlink kit (dish and router) and to pay a monthly subscription. 

First question is, while it's theoretically possible to capture the internet from any place on earth as long as you have the Starlink kit (assuming there are enough satellites orbiting the specific area in question to provide enough coverage for the dish to capture the beam), but Starlink may restrict the service from being used in Tunisia due to different reasons such as the government not allowing it to operate here to protect our magnificent local ISPs such as Topshit and Globalcrap. Do you think it will be available here?

Second question is about the price, the kit is currently priced at $499 USD and the monthly subscription is priced at $99 USD/month, do you think that these prices are meant for the purchasing power of Americans and will be adjusted to fit the purchasing power of different countries and to minimize competition? 

In my opinion, if Starlink penetrates the Tunisian market and offer reasonable prices, it could potentially put local ISPs out of business or seriously harm them and it will allow Tunisians to stream movies in HD/UHD, to take advantage of the ultra low latency to play online games with no lag and to watch artificial porn in full HD.",,,,,,2021-05-04 01:22:12

Is it true that El-Nahdha are trying to distance themselves from Islamic fundamentalism? I’ve heard this, but I thought their whole schtick was trying to incorporate religion into politics.      
I hear a lot about how these politicians and ministers are stealing. Is there any proof that they are stealing or is it just an assumption because politicians are known in Tunisia to steal?

I know this question has became so prevalent and quite infuriating given that almost everyone I've seen is salty about (or rather dissatisfied with) the current financial situation, customs regulations, and their restrained offshore monetary transactions, but here I am asking this anyways.  
The CTI, Carte Technologique Internationale, as you may know it, is a prepaid ""debit"" card, which is much like a gift card, allows you limited deposits that get used up, and the most abhorrent of all is the fact that it isn't even accepted in some websites, which in turn limits its potential use cases.  
I haven't gotten one yet, it seemed rather futile to me as a person who wants to do music and get it physically and digitally distributed, and almost all websites that offered publishing required a valid credit card (which is usually the case in countless other services) and not some kind of fishy unusable card.  
Well, I know that several ""free"" ways exist, and are somewhat viable, but if you want to propel your ""career"" you'll have to actively invest in it, and then there's crypto art that I'd really want to do, which I deem impossible given the way this whole card thing works.  
That being said, the CTI seems enticing until you realize what it's meant for: web hosting, ads, mobile apps, you name it, nothing else really, it's capped at 1K TND a year so that's also a bummer.  
Anyways I know I'm not an ""established artist"" by any means I'm just starting out but I'd really want to slowly turn my craft into a viable source of income since I'm technically a college dropout and I thought I'd give it a shot but so many hindrances come in the way which makes me wonder whether it might be feasible or not...  
So what do you guys think about the CTI? Is it a useful asset? Is there any other alternative? Should one scrap this entire ""privileged dream concept"" in favor of a traditional day job? If you get occasional wire transfers into your local bank account do you get charged more? Is it even legal to begin with?  
Well I think I could elaborate further but it's already off-topic. I'm sorry for such a long text I'm just feeling a bit lost and ""desperate"" I'd say.

Any help (or any kind of input) would be greatly appreciated! Thanks! :)",,,,,,2021-05-08 01:31:59

Tunisian users have shared massively on social media a photo of a street plate in the city of Marsa.

This plate indicates that the street is named after Iraqi poet Badr Shakir al-Sayyab, , but the sign carried several linguistic errors not only in Latin letters but also in Arabic, starting with its written name «Bader, his last name writes Essaieb and Arabic - instead of » .

""وافق أو نافق أو غادر البلاد"" 

""Sois d'accord, sois hypocrite ou quitte le pays""

Bien que tout tunisien connaît bien ces paroles, je pense que très peu sont ceux ont saisit la quintessence d'une si célèbre expression d'Ibn Khaldoun.

La plus part confond traîtrise et hypocrisie, bien qu'ils soient semblables et de ce fait analogique, ça ne fait pas d'eux identiques.

Non, ici, l'hypocrisie n'est pas utilisée pour dépeindre un fallacieux, quelqu'un qui cassera du sucre sur ton dos et sera là, prêt à savourer ta chute. Non, parce que je pense et je sais qu'Ibn Khaldoun ne nous aurait pas inciter à devenir ce que l'on hait. Non, il s'agissait plutôt de conserver un idéal immaculé, et de le cacher pour le préserver et lui éviter d'être corrompu par la noirceur des autres. Il s'agissait surtout de se prêter au jeu de la méchanceté du reste, sans jamais y succomber, sans jamais perdre notre innocence, faire profil bas et mine d'accepter les idéologies de la majorité.

C'est pour cela que je trouve ça ironique, que les personnes qu'Ibn Khaldoun réprimandait pour la noirceur de leurs cœurs, soient les premières à poster ses paroles.

Ces personnes qui trouveront toujours quelque chose à redire. Qu'on te voie réussir sans rien dire, tu n'es qu'un cachetier, tu veux réussir pendant qu'eux échouent.

Qu'on te voie réussir en l'insinuant, tu n'es rien qu'un prétentieux, un m'as-tu-vu comme on l'en fait peu.

Qu'on te voie réussir en le chuchotant, tu n'es qu'un vendu, un moins que rien, ils ne te parleront que quand ils en auront besoin.

Je suis fasciné, après tout... ils font tant d'efforts pour justifier leurs échecs et ""justifier"" ta réussite, que s'ils se concentraient ne serait-ce qu'un tant soit peu, ils auraient des résultats respectables.

Et si tu essaies d'être pragmatique, de pointer cela du doigt, alors tu es le pire des fayots et le roi des arrogants, tu retombes au plus bas de l'échelle et tu espères qu'il y a une place pour ta petite personne, dans leur folie abyssale.

Et si je le voulais, j'aurais publié ceci sur mon compte principal, mais oh ma douce Tunisie, je te connais, et je connais les dires d'Ibn Khaldoun. Je cacherais mon arrogance et mon zèle, et je prétendrai de suivre le troupeau, avec à sa tête, des milliers de fainéants.",,,,,,2021-05-10 14:58:25

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No. You can not if you reside in Tunisia. No, you can not if you live in Tunisia.

2. Can I open a Bitcoin account? (Same as above). Can you mine it? Yes, but you can’t buy it. 

3. Can I ask Google about the most fucking mundane topics that pop in my head?! Hellz yeah you can, just sit your ass down and Google your question(s) or use whatever search engine out there on the Interwebs. 

4. Can I use this card or the other one to pay for this or that, or can I ship to and/or from Tunisia to the moon and back etc etc etc...(btw it’s etcetera and NOT excetera), the answer is probably somewhere either in English or French or Arabic, all you have to do is actually fucking do and not ask right away. 

5. Last but not least, can I use PayPal?! No, you cannot and that’s simply because PP is not available in Tunisia. Even if you live overseas and you have a PP account you won’t be able to use it in Tunisia. 

So, to summarize, if you have a question about anything and I mean ANYTHING, take the time it would take you to ask Reddit or this sub and ask Google first. Ok, pumpkins?! Seriously do it.",,,,,,2021-05-10 20:00:13

IF YOU ARE ON A RELIGIOUS DUTY AND THINKING THIS MIGHT INTERFERE WITH YOUR CURRENT PRACTICES PLEASE WAIT UNTIL TOMORROW OR MAKE SURE TO REACT, RESPOND OR HOLD AN ARGUMENT ONCE YOUR RELIGIOUS DUTY IS LIFTED. \*

&amp;#x200B;

Being anonynmous online comes with a lot of benefits for people like me, especially when it comes to confessing my deepest regrets. I am not a righteous practioner of Islam, I am not even a believer anymore, nor I will be in the next few years.

&amp;#x200B;

As 95% of tunisians, I live in a muslim family by inheritence, none of them experienced any kind of existential or religious crisis, the standard type of people everyone is accustomed to see much like NPCs than actual human beings, but the story is far away than that. As my whole family is fasting, and so I do, with obligation and against my will , despite having a baccalaureate exam this year, and I am literaly finding zero energy to study or to practice any kind of cognitive effort in any given task or subject.

&amp;#x200B;

This emptiness has come along with a slight increase in sexual activity, and obviously such sexual acts were trigerred by visual contents I had access to freely and without any cyber limit, this type of content is what we coin with pornography.

&amp;#x200B;

I think that pornography is literally ruining the mind of people especially young males, exploiting their fantasies and rendering them into weak creatures unable to outcome this multicorporate-thing. Though I don't believe in eastern wisdom, Hindouism defines something called the Root Chakra to be a ""powerful essence of pure energy and potential to be existent in the region of genitals"". This Root Chakra is even more powerful than all the other Chakras existent in your other body regions, and only the mind has a nearly close energy to fight and defeat it or at least decrease its effects . I may have not transferred the idea well, because, I confess I did not really dive into the matter. But I remember my impressions about it , and remember that I have told myself, despite the mystic icons used in this approach, when applying isomorphism on it on the space of reality, the images do combine together to give a similar result to what may have someone found from an objective point of view (a scientific/ psychological point of view).

&amp;#x200B;

Pornography fills a lot of people with shame (or at least, so I think), in a time when Masculanity is being attacked by all these neo-liberalists, post-modernists (feminazists ?) kind of ideologies constantly broadcasted on many international communication platforms, when unhealthy lifestyle and food are inhibiting the raw power of many men, when society has never put such toil on men as nowadays, whether by accusing them for being the source of all evil that happened to mankind, or by accusing ""ALL OF THEM "" to be misogynic, sexist and racist, whether even when it comes to dating and relationships, marriage, professionnal career and most importantly : EXPECTATIONS. Pornography feels like the final hit that knocks many men, especially young men, to the ground. It takes a huge time, because of the eventual later fantasies that get stuck in your mind for a very long time.

&amp;#x200B;

Pornography downgrades women as well, I still find it confusing to see that women are calling to stop sexualizing them, but in the same time, they are voluntarily and even racing to make part of this filthy industry, that makes them objects instead of humans. I recognize feeling the rush of Testosterone (maybe without Oxytocin because I don't feel satisfied on the long term) during the very few moments of my filthy practice, but once I am down the slope, the first thought that comes to my head, is why would a woman , a fully thinking human being , with equal OVERALL cognitive potential as a man, accept to be gangbanged , or violently thrusted in , in biologically unsuitable and inaccomodate places?

&amp;#x200B;

The aftermath of pornography is even worse, because once your mind has been normalized with the sight of undescent pictures of women , that's when it crosses all the limits even without your conscious permission. Later imagery, of relatives or friends, are being depicted inside your head, and implanted in such a way, that any resistance makes it harder to retrieve, and less relevant to counter. I don't think that any person on earth, once they reach this far, wouldn't feel regret and a ton of shame and most importantly associated psychological distress and pain.

&amp;#x200B;

Pornography is an actual trigger for OCD, sexual obessions and as every single obsession on earth, resistance increases its action, the more you try to give up on this habit, the less likely you will do, and the more you try to go with it, the more likely you are to experience confidence issues, hallucinations about things that you fear they may happen despite being nearly impossible, and relationship issues with people especially with opposite-sex individuals.

&amp;#x200B;

I confess that my mind , has been so far conditioned , to accept the sight of many female friends in inappropriate situations, and despite how horrible it sounds, I do really recognize the serioussness of this matter , and I am fully aware , how much wrong is it. Regardless of your religious affiliation, such an act is always considered to be bad on so many levels.

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking to know your thoughts about the subject, you can freely relate your experiences and comment any way you like, as a closure, I want to say that banning pornography can have a huge positive impact on young males, regardless of any religious interpretation because for the nth time , we are not a MUSLIM country, a country cannot have a religion in the first place, because it is something personal and does not imply on something that is not human such as a nation. I would like to see youg people sharing my perspective and working together to ban such a disastrous industry that is consuming our masculanity , our confidence, and even ruining our relationship with people!",,,,,,2021-05-12 07:56:48

The stories on that forum made me feel nauseous. Usually it's a man using a western woman so that she sends him money (once he makes her believe he loves her). He also involves his family in the process (asks her to talk to his mom etc). Sometimes it's very sad because the woman already has a kid and too and needs the money but he starts blackmailing her and telling her is gonna commit suicide (w yebda howa w sou7abou yfalmou 3leha etc).Anyways they kept saying how Tunisian men are lazy and even when they get their visa to Europe they don't have the entrepreunial mindset and still except to be spoon-fed by the government/wife. And some even called them prostitutes (selling love and sex for money).This is embarrassing. What is the root of this problem in your opinion? I mean Syrian and Lebanese men have war problems etc but they don't step this low as far as I know.

You can obviously guess what I found: Most of them don't care. They are feasting, taking pictures of themselves and showing how happy they are.
This made me ask a question: Are influencers worth following? I mean what is the added value that they are giving to society?
I have been asking myself this questions for a quite long period as am seeing them living in a world of superiority thinking that they are supreme creature, that we need their advice... etc
I have asked myself a lot of times how did they get their first followers. But now I have a simple answer: for example on Instagram they start by following a huge number of people and once they follow them back they do the magic trick: unfollowing them.
This seemes quite convincing answer for me so far. Then they start talking about how famous they are and start giving us advice on how to live.
Oh come on this is ridiculous!
By this I want to say that they have no supremacy but they fabricated their lives in a style that could get the attention of most people. They are perpetually looking for attention because they have no producf to sell but some ridiculous photos on the net.
People who followed this process in order to be famous are not worth following. They may have some knowledge but it's not by knowledge that they become influencers.
Therefore, they are not concerned about social problems and what society needs or wants, they are just making ads using their tricks that's why they must maximize the audiance and never talk about politics or anything that could lessen the number of followers.
I am sad that people are not aware about how these people do not reflect society but they are some products.",,,,,,2021-05-15 01:42:32

The acting is good, the storyline is good, the message is good, the cinematography is good and on top of it, it is very relevant to today's news etc. I think people outside of Tunisia would find it interesting as well.  
Most Tunisian shows aren't Netflix worthy (especially not El Hiwar and Ettassia ones). But shows like el Maestro and 7arga are top quality and Netflix-worthy.  


On the other hand, I tried watching el Foundo (because the soundtrack bangs) but I was underwhelmed. Same as with ""Wled Moufida"". The acting is mediocre (except for the big names), the long and boring 10 mins slow-motion of the protagonist crying, the inability to properly ""wrap up"" the story and having weird endings etc...

I have seen a lot of people on this sub (thankfully a minority) who seem pretty adamant on either shit-talking people posting on social media in support of Palestine or going out and protesting, with some going as far as to either talk about the conflict as if it is ""two-sided"" or outright support Israel.

Tunisia's position is clear : We almost entirely support Palestine, as evidenced by countless polls on the subject. You might want to discard that as ""blind tribalism based on a shared religion and ethnicity"" but the fact of the matter is Palestinians are an oppressed people who have been displaced from their homeland by colonists. This is as ""Black and White"" as the Apartheid regime in South Africa. Even if you are the most anti-Muslim and anti-Arab person alive, I at least expect from you the moral decency to recognize the blight of the Palestinians. Supporting Israel isn't being a ""free thinker"", it is just being an edgy contrarian.

I tried to get involved and subscribe in the [BDS](https://bdsmovement.net/) website, but I didn't see Tunisia mentioned as an available country in their form, despite the existence of many Arabic countries like Morocco, Egypt, etc.

you can check this fact by visiting this [form](https://bdsmovement.net/get-involved/join-a-bds-campaign). I don't know why Tunisia still isn't there. boycotting Israel is an effective way to stand with Palestine. Putting an economic pressure against Israel will sure help the Palestinian cause. However, the public isn't aware of this fact.

The only ones I have in mind are the dozens Bourguiba statues scattered around the country, Ibn Khaldun of Nahj bourguiba and the bust of Farhat Hached in Rades. And if we can count it as a statue there is the bust of Abu Qasim El chebbi in Tozeur.  
**Hypothetically,** if we were to build statues of important historical figures from Tunisia (or linked to Tunisia), who who would you choose?  


These are the ones I have in mind:

**1- Hannibal** (Carthaginian general)  
**2- Daghbegi** (fellaga that fought for independence and got executed in front of his family)  
**3- Lazhar Chraiti** (Fellaga that fought for our independence and fought in Palestine)  
**4- Moncef Bey** (One of the best beys Tunisia had)  
**5- Ibn Manzur** (author of the best known dictionary of the Arabic language)  
**6- Ibn Al Jazar** ""Algizar"" (medieval author on Medicine)   
**7- Azzedine Alaia** (most famous Tunisian fashion designer)  
**8-  Tewhida Ben Sheikh** (first modern Tunisian woman in North Africa to become a physician)  
**9- Yusuf Reis/Jack Ward:** Well this one is a bit odd because pirates aren't exactly worthy of admiration   
but I find it interesting that one of the most famous English pirates settled in Tunisia and it could be funny to have a statue of him next to a port or something.  
**10-  Khaled Abdul Wahab** (Tunisian man who protected Jews from Nazis during WW2)  
**11- Leo Africanus** (Famous medieval cartographer. He was Andalusian and studied in Morocco but he settled back and died in Tunisia after Christians freed him).  
**12- Hedi Jouini** (one of the best ambassadors of Tunisian music)  
**13- Aziza Othamna** (Tunisian princess and Philanthropist) 

There are many interesting awliya and jurists/imams as well such as Lella Manoubia, Ibn Arafa, Sidi Mehrez etc but I chose to keep out religious figures since it can be  (very) controversial and they usually already have zaouias anyways.",,,,,,2021-05-19 20:12:24

So I've seen dating subreddits where people find someone they can love and date, so as someone who is single and struggled with finding someone I felt that reddit can be helpful when it comes to dating and so me and u/ConstantBluebird9902 created a dating subreddit specifically for Tunisian redditors, r/tunisiansdating

The idea is simple, you can just make a pot there introducing yourself and writing that you are looking for someone to love, you can be detailed about your ideal SO in things like height, body type etc... and you can freely write whatever you want as long as it's relevant and respectful.

You can also share your experience and write an advice, as long as it's related to dating in Tunisia it belongs there.

One important thing to note is that the subreddit is still under construction and we need experienced mods to help us out with managing it, so if you are interested then either contact me or contact u/ConstantBluebird9902

We are also open for feedback so if you have anything in mind please let us know.",,,,,,2021-05-22 23:35:08

I left after high school in 2015 and so I have no idea whatsoever how things work back home when you're an employee. As a Canadian permanent resident I would be paying taxes to Canada during that time but I'm wondering if there's a chance I could get flagged for whatever reason and asked to pay taxes or charged with tax evasion? Does the government monitor bank accounts with foreign currency transfers? Should I just bring cash in dollars instead of transferring money to myself?

I also read on this subreddit that there's a crackdown on freelancers. Does anyone know what the issue was there? Is it because they were being paid in foreign currency?

The Egyptian Trade Union Federation was founded in 1957, and became the only legal trade union, under Nasser’s state. The basis of this was the provision of job security and other economic benefits like a share in the net profit and social welfare programmes in exchange for political quietism and subordination, in order to maintain state control over the labour movement. 

This social contract broke down from the 80’s onwards as the ETUF maintained a monopoly over worker’s representation while retracting the benefits, the latter of which was part of a larger liberalizing trend in the region. 

&gt;Economic Reform and Structural Adjustment Plans (ERSAP) and agreements with the US, EU, WTO, IMF, and the World Bank within the region from the 1980s onwards included lowering custom tariffs and taxes on imports; opening up markets to foreign investments in telecommunication, the financial sector, transport, and energy; privatizing public sector companies and deregulating the labour market (lowering minimum wages, ending severance pay, making hiring and firing more flexible); and liberalizing real estate. These measures aimed to transform the state-led import substitution economies of the 1960s into export-oriented economies based on private foreign and local investment and deregularized cheap labour. ^1

In contrast, the Tunisian General Labour Union (UGTT, its French acronym) was founded in 1946, 10 years before Tunisia’s independence, took part in the independence of Tunisia, and thus was afforded a certain level of autonomy. It went through periods of collaboration and antagonism with the state, with the rank and file sometimes successfully pulling it in the direction of militancy. 

&gt;This in turn guaranteed it a certain level of autonomy in the following authoritarian rule of Tunisia’s first president Habib Bourguiba, who was reliant on the UGTT to consolidate regime legitimacy. Under Bourguiba, the union was inconsistent in its cooperation or confrontation with the regime. The 1960s saw a period of relative stability and collaboration, yet throughout the 1970s – most notably the 1978 general strike – and 1980s the union militantly opposed attempts to implement IMF-back neoliberal economic reforms. This became a distinctive feature of the UGTT, that unlike other trade unions in the Arab world it never fully integrated into the state apparatus. Instead, it maintained two duel – albeit ambiguous – positions: a bureaucracy and leadership that was most often complicit with the state, but more significantly, a tendency to fall on the side of the workers and activists when attempts to resist the ruling power put pressure on the union leadership in times of crisis. ^2

There were dissidents in both the ETUF and the UGTT, but the Tunisian ones are predicably stronger. 

Despite the subordination of the ETUF to the state, the 2000s saw increased militancy from Egyptian workers outside the confines of the federation as a result of reforms like law 203 (accepted by the ETUF) in 1991, which put 314 public enterprises for sale. By 1999, 137 were sold. The ETUF further discredited itself by the acceptance of labour law 12 of 2003, “which replaced previous fixed contracts with flexible, temporary contracts”. ^1 

With this in the background, December 2006 was a significant juncture, where workers at the Misr Spinning and Weaving Company (employing 25k) went on strike prompted by a pay dispute, “when, for the first time since the social contract [of 1957], the strike became the main instrument of resistance in Egypt.” ^1 Workers demanded the impeachment of local union officials. ^3 This was followed by a subsequent phase of labour struggle where strikes were more frequent, longer in duration, and more widespread. As time went on, and demands were refused, demands that were originally just economic (increasing minimum wage) became more political, focused on the general economic policy of the government and boycotting the ETUF in favour of organizing independent trade unions. In 2009, tax officials left the ETUF to form their own union, and were followed in 2010 by public transport workers, teachers, and health technicians as well as pensioners. 
In Tunisia, the UGTT “maintained an ‘unstable cohabitation between a neutralized leadership and an uncontrolled base’”. ^1 While many of the higher bureaucracy were coopted by the state, the regional and local cadres were more radical and connected to the rank and file. This is best seen during the Gafsa rebellion in 2008, a declining phosphate mining area in the interior of the country. The Gafsa Mining Company, the main employer in the area, had been firing many workers over the years with unemployment reaching 20-39% and 40% of people below the poverty line. Sit-ins, demonstrations, marches, and clashes lasted for six months. 

This rebellion failed, but the union activists had learned from the mistake of remaining isolated in 2008, so that when Mohamed Bouazizi immolated himself on December 17 2010, union members immediately organized support demonstrations after uprisings in sidi Bouzid where Bouazizi lived. A lawyers sit-in on December 25, a lawyers general strike on January 6, and a general strike on January 14 which brought down ben-ali. 

This is in contrast with the ETUF, which sided with Mubarak and not the protests against him. The independent trade unions in Egypt formed the Egyptian Federation of Independent Trade Unions (EFITU), and in march of 2011 demanded the dissolution of the ETUF. A rival independent union federation, the Democratic Labour Congress, also formed. 

Once Mubarak was gone the subsequent rulers were no friends to labour. The supreme council of the armed forces (SCAF), ruling from feb 2011 to June 2012, and the Muslim Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) did not pass new trade union laws. The SCAF criminalized protests that disrupted work. The military government that took over after Morsi in July 2013 was ousted made involvement in strikes something you could be imprisoned for. 

Morsi’s government tried to use the same corporatist methods of controlling labour. The minister of manpower was an FJP member (in a cabinet where few were FJP members, emphasizing the importance Morsi put on controlling labour) and FJP members were added to the ETUF board (which under Morsi’s decree no. 97, are appointed by the minister of manpower. The same decree forced those over 60, remnants of the Mubarak regime, to be removed). They were ousted after Morsi was. In addition:

&gt; Also, the FJP put forward a draft law on labor unions that would have prohibited the establishment of new professional unions, preserved the structure of centralized decision-making within the ETUF, and made it difficult for workers to leave the ETUF without risking losing their access to social funds. The close connection between ETUF membership and access to these funds poses significant obstacles for the emergence of independent unions. ^4 

In Tunisia, independent trade union federations were formed after Ben-ali fell, often with former UGTT members as founders, and with criticisms of the UGTT, such as claims of corruption. The UGTT was not severely challenged by these independent trade unions the way the ETUF was. In addition to superior financial resources and larger membership, its history of relative independence gave it greater credibility than the ETUF. After Ben-ali, new union federations were legalized, but, as before, only the UGTT could participate in tripartite negotiations. (In Egypt no regular practice of tripartite negotiations exist.) 

The UGTT also played a mediating role, to try and mitigate the political crises after ben-ali’s ouster. It is able to take on this role because of it’s political clout, organizational strength, and history of militancy. That last factor is in part because the lack of political pluralism in the past has led to activists relying on the UGTT as a vehicle for human rights and general freedom struggles, making the UGTT a sort of umbrella organization. 

The UGTT’s role as a mediator sometimes led to them deprioritizing labour struggles, such as in November of 2013 when negotiations by workers on temporary contracts demanding permanent contracts were delayed because UGTT central leadership was not able to attend the negotiations. It’s role as mediator has also mitigated internal reforms over issues such as “internal corruption, the underrepresentation of women in the organization’s leadership positions, issues of internal democracy, and membership expansion.” ^4

It is noteworthy that the islamist party, Ennhada, often had an antagonistic relationship with the UGTT, warning that the UGTT would become partisan players by siding with leftist political parties, and criticizing it for its reliance on street mobilization for pressuring the government. 

In Tunisia, for various reasons, the democratic revolution was not undone, even after the political deadlock that took place after the Ennhada party formed government in 2011, which was succeeded by a caretaker government taking over in 2013 until new elections were held in 2014, when Ennhada joined the opposition. As mentioned before, this was partly because the UGTT played the role of mediator (along with other civil society organizations, the Tunisian Association of Human Rights, the Lawyers’ Association, and the Tunisian Union of Industry, Commerce, and Traditional Crafts.)

The political deadlock in Egypt, on the other hand, led to a military coup and the return of military dictatorship. As for what this meant for labour, “By 2013 a total of 1,000 independent trade unions had sprung up. In 2012 3,817 labour incidents were reported, a fourfold increase since 2007.” ^1 In addition:

&gt; In Egypt, all independent unions were dissolved in March 2018 and given 60 days to reregister their organisation based on new arbitrary requirements established in Law no. 213/2017 on Trade Unions. Out of 1,000 independent unions, only 122 were able to successfully register their status under the new law and within the timeframe. ^5

&amp;#x200B;

Islamism has arisen in societies traumatised by the  impact of capitalism – first in the form of external conquest by  imperialism and then, increasingly, by the transformation of internal  social relations accompanying the rise of a local capitalist class and  the formation of an independent capitalist state.

Old social classes have been replaced by new ones, although not  instantaneously or in a clear cut manner. What Trotsky described as  “combined and uneven development” has occurred. Externally, colonialism  has retreated, but the great imperialist powers – especially the US –  continue to use their military forces as a bargaining tool to influence  the production of the Middle East’s single major resource, oil.  Internally, state encouragement – and often ownership – has led to the  development of some large scale modern industry, but large sectors of  “traditional” industry remain, based on vast numbers of small workshops  where the owner works with a couple of workers, often from his own  family. Land reform has turned some peasants into modern capitalist  farmers – but displaced many more, leaving them with little or no land,  so forcing them to eke out a livelihood from casual labour in the  workshops or markets of sprawling urban slums. A massive expansion of  the education system is turning out vast numbers of high school and  college graduates, but these then find insufficient job opportunities in  the modern sectors of the economy and place their hopes on getting into  the state bureaucracy, while eking out a living with scraps of work  around the informal sector – touting for custom from shopkeepers, acting  as guides for tourists, selling lottery tickets, driving taxis and so  on.

The crises of the world economy over the last 20 years have  aggravated all these contradictions. The modern industries have found  the national economy too small for them to operate efficiently, but the  world economy too competitive for them to survive without state  protection. The traditional industries have not generally been able to  modernise without state support and they cannot compensate for the  failure of modern industry to provide jobs for the burgeoning urban  population. But a few sectors have managed to establish links of their  own with international capital and increasingly resent the state’s  domination of the economy. The urban rich increasingly lap up the luxury  goods available on the world market, creating growing resentment among  the casual workers and the unemployed.

Islamism represents an attempt to come to terms with these  contradictions by people who have been brought up to respect traditional  Islamic ideas. But it does not find its support equally in all sections  of society. For some sections embrace a modern secular bourgeois or  nationalist ideology, while other sections gravitate towards some form  of secular working class response. The Islamic revival gets sustenance  from four different social groupings – each of which interprets Islam in  its own way.

[Top of the page](https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1994/xx/islam.htm#top)  
 

*i. The Islamism of the old exploiters:* First  there are those members of the traditional privileged classes who fear  losing out in the capitalist modernisation of society – particularly  landowners (including clergy dependent on incomes from land belonging to  religious foundations), traditional merchant capitalists, the owners of  the mass of small shops and workshops. Such groups have often been the  traditional sources of finance for the mosques and see Islam as a way of  defending their established way of life and of making those who oversee  change listen to their voices. Thus in Iran and Algeria it was this  group which provided the resources to the clergy to oppose the state’s  land reform programme in the 1960s and 1970s.  
 

*ii. The Islamism of the new exploiters:* Second,  often emerging from among this first group, are some of the capitalists  who have enjoyed success despite hostility from those groups linked to  the state. In Egypt, for instance, the present day Muslim Brotherhood  “wormed their way into the economic fabric of Sadat’s Egypt at a time  when whole sections of it had been turned over to unregulated  capitalism. Uthman Ahmad Uthman, the Egyptian Rockefeller, made no  secret of this sympathy for the Brethren”. [\[15\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1994/xx/islam.htm#n15)

In Turkey the Welfare Party, which is led by a former member of the  main conservative party, enjoys the support of much of middle sized  capital. In Iran among the *bazaaris* who gave support to  Khomeini against the Shah were substantial capitalists resentful at the  way economic policies favoured those close to the crown.  
 

*iii. The Islamism of the poor:* The third group  are the rural poor who have suffered under the advance of capitalist  farming and who have been forced into the cities as they desperately  look for work. Thus in Algeria out of a total rural population of 8.2  million only 2 million gained anything from the land reform. The other 6  million were faced with the choice between increased poverty in the  countryside and going to the cities to seek work. [\[16\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1994/xx/islam.htm#n16)  But in the cities: “The lowest group are the hard core jobless made up  of displaced former peasants who have flooded the cities in search of  work and social opportunity ... detached from rural society without  being truly integrated into urban society”. [\[17\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1994/xx/islam.htm#n17)

They lost the certainties associated with an old way of life –  certainties which they identify with traditional Muslim culture –  without gaining a secure material existence or a stable way of life:  “Clear guidelines for behaviour and belief no longer exist for millions  of Algerians caught between a tradition that no longer commands their  total loyalty and a modernism that cannot satisfy the psychological and  spiritual needs of young people in particular”. [\[18\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1994/xx/islam.htm#n18)

In such a situation even Islamic agitation against land reform on  behalf of the old landowners in the 1970s could appeal to the peasants  and ex-peasants. For the land reform could be a symbol of a  transformation of the countryside that had destroyed a secure, if  impoverished, way of life. “To the landed proprietors and the peasants  without land, the Islamists held out the same prospect: the Koran  stigmatised the expropriation of things belonging to others; it  recommended to the rich and those who ruled according to the *Sunna* to be generous to others”. [\[19\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1994/xx/islam.htm#n19)

The appeal of Islamism grew through the 1980s as economic crisis  increased the contrast between the impoverished masses and the elite of  about 1 percent of the population who run the state and the economy.  Their wealth and their Westernised lifestyles ill fitted their claim to  be the heirs of the liberation struggle against the French. It was very  easy for the ex-peasants to identify the “non-Islamic” behaviour of this  elite as the cause of their own misery.

In Iran likewise the capitalist transformation of agriculture  embodied in the Shah’s land reform of the 1960s benefitted a minority of  the toilers, while leaving the rest no better off and sometimes worse  off. It increased the antagonism of the rural and recently urbanised  poor against the state – an antagonism which did no harm to Islamic  forces which had opposed the land reform. So when, for instance, in 1962  the Shah used the forces of the state against Islamic figures, this  turned them into a focus for the discontent of very large numbers of  people.

In Egypt the “opening up” of the economy to the world market through  agreements with the World Bank and the IMF from the mid-1970s onwards  substantially worsened the situation of the mass of peasants and  ex-peasants, creating enormous pools of bitterness. And in Afghanistan  the land reforms which were imposed after the PDPA (Communist Party)  coup of 1978 led to a series of spontaneous risings from all sections of  the rural population:

The reforms put an end to the traditional ways of  working based on mutual self interest without introducing any  alternative. The landowners who had been dispossessed of their land were  careful not to distribute any seed to their sharecroppers; people who  traditionally had been willing to provide loans now refused to do so.  There were plans for the creation of a bank for agricultural development  and for setting up an office to oversee the distribution of seed and  fodder, but none of this had been done when the reforms actually took  place ... So it was the very act of announcing the reforms that cut the  peasant off from his seed supplies ... The reform destroyed not just the  economic structure but the whole social framework of production ... It  is not surprising, therefore, that instead of setting 98 percent of the  people against 2 percent of the exploiting classes, these reforms led to  a general revolt of 75 percent of the rural areas. \[And\] when the new  system was seen not to be working \[even\] the peasants who had initially  welcomed reform felt they would be better off going back to the old  system. [\[20\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1994/xx/islam.htm#n20)

But it is not only hostility to the state that makes  ex-peasants receptive to the message of the Islamists. The mosques  provide a social focus for people lost in a new and strange city, the  Islamic charities the rudiments of welfare services (clinics, schooling,  etc) which are lacking from the state. So in Algeria the growth of the  cities in the 1970s and 1980s was accompanied by a massive increase in  the number of mosques: “Everything happened as if the paralysis in  education and Arabisation, the absence of structures of culture and  leisure, the lack of space for public liberty, the shortage of homes,  made thousands of adults, youth and children disposed for the mosques”. [\[21\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1994/xx/islam.htm#n21)

In this way, funds which came from those with diametrically opposed  interests to the mass of people – from the old landowning class, the new  rich or the Saudi government – could provide both a material and a  cultural haven for the poor. “In the mosque, everyone – new or old  bourgeois, fundamentalist, worker in an enterprise – saw the possibility  of the elaboration or realisation of his own strategy, dreams and  hopes”. [\[22\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1994/xx/islam.htm#n22)

This did not obliterate the class divisions within the mosque. In  Algeria, for example, there were innumerable rows in mosque committees  between people whose different social background made them see the  building of the mosques in different ways – for instance, over when they  should refuse to accept donations for the mosque because they came from  sinful (*haram*) sources. “It is rare in fact for a religious  committee to accomplish its mandate, fixed in principle at two years,  with the harmony and agreement recommended by the cult of the unity of  the divine which the *muezzins* chant without cease.” [\[23\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1994/xx/islam.htm#n23)  But the rows remained cloaked in a religious guise – and have not  stopped the proliferation of the mosques and the growth in the influence  of Islamism.  
 

*iv. The Islamism of the new middle class:*  However, neither the “traditional” exploiting classes nor the  impoverished masses provide the vital element which sustains revivalist,  political Islam – the cadre of activists who propagate its doctrines  and risk injury, imprisonment and death in confrontation with their  enemies.

The traditional exploiting classes are by their very nature  conservative. They are prepared to donate money so that others can fight  – especially in defence of their material interests. They did so when  faced with the land reform in Algeria in the early 1970s; when the  Baathist regime in Syria encroached upon the interests of the urban  merchants and traders in the spring of 1980s; [\[24\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1994/xx/islam.htm#n24)  and when the merchants and small businessmen of the Iranian bazaars  felt themselves under attack from the Shah in 1976-78 and threatened by  the left in 1979-81. But they are wary of putting their own businesses,  let alone their own lives, at risk. And so they can hardly be the force  that has torn societies like Algeria and Egypt apart, caused a whole  town, Hama, to rise in revolt in Syria, used suicide bombs against the  Americans and Israelis in Lebanon – and which caused the Iranian  Revolution to take a turn much more radical than any section of the  Iranian bourgeoisie expected.

This force, in fact, comes from a fourth, very different stratum –  from a section of the new middle class that has arisen as a result of  capitalist modernisation right across the Third World.

In Iran the cadres of all three of the Islamist movements that  dominated the politics of the first years of the revolution came from  this background. Thus one account tells of the support for the first  post-revolutionary prime minister, Bazargan:

As Iran’s educational system expanded in the 1950s and  1960s, even wider groups of traditional middle class people gained  access to the country’s universities. Confronted with institutions  dominated by the older, Westernised elites, these newcomers to academia  felt an urgent need to justify their continued adherence to Islam to  themselves. They joined the Muslim Students Associations \[run by  Bazargan etc\] ... upon entering professional life, the new engineers  often joined the Islamic Association of Engineers, also founded by  Bazargan. This association network constituted the real organised social  support for Bazargan and Islamic modernism ... Bazargan’s and  Taleqani’s appeal \[depended on\] the way they gave the rising members of  the traditional middle classes a sense of dignity which allowed them to  affirm their identity in a society politically dominated by what they  saw as a Godless, Westernised and corrupt elite. [\[25\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1994/xx/islam.htm#n25)

Writing of the People’s Mojahedin of Iran, Abrahamian  comments that many studies of the first years of the Iranian Revolution  have talked of the appeal of radical Islam to the “oppressed”, but that  it was not the oppressed in general who formed the basis of the  Mojahedin; rather it was that very large section of the new middle class  whose parents had been part of the traditional petty bourgeoisie. He  gives breakdowns of the occupations of Mojahedin arrested under the Shah  and subject to repression under Khomeini to support his argument. [\[26\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1994/xx/islam.htm#n26)

Although the third Islamist force, the ultimately victorious Islamic  Republican Party of Khomeini, is usually thought of as run by the clergy  linked to the traditional *bazaari* merchant capitalists,  Moaddel has shown that more than half its MPs were from the professions,  teachers, government employees or students – even if a quarter came  from *bazaari* families. [\[27\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1994/xx/islam.htm#n27)  And Bayat has noted that in their struggle to defeat the workers’  organisations in the factories, the regime could rely on the  professional engineers who worked there. [\[28\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1994/xx/islam.htm#n28)

Azar Tabari notes that after the downfall of the Shah very large  numbers of women in the Iranian cities opted to wear the veil and lined  up with the followers of Khomeini against the left. She claims these  women came from that section of the middle class that was the first  generation to undergo a process of “social integration”. Often from  traditional petty bourgeois families – with fathers who were bazaar  merchants, tradesmen and so on – they were forced into higher education  as traditional opportunities for their families to make money declined  with industrialisation. There were openings for them in professions like  teaching and nursing. But “these women had to go through the often  painful and traumatic experience of first generation adjustment”:

As the young women from such families began to go to  universities or work in hospitals, all these traditional concepts came  under daily attack from “alien” surroundings, where women mixed with  men, wore no veils, and sometimes dressed according to the latest  European fashions. Women were often torn between accepted family norms  and the pressure of the new environment. They could not be veiled at  work, nor could they leave home unveiled.

One widespread response to these contradictory pressures  was “a retreat into Islam”, “symbolised by deliberately veiled women  demonstrators during large mobilisations”. Tabari claims this response  stood in marked contrast to that of women whose families had been part  of the new middle class for two or three generations, and who refused to  wear the veil and identified with the liberals or the left. [\[29\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1994/xx/islam.htm#n29) In Afghanistan, Roy notes:

The Islamist movement was born in the modern sectors  of society and developed from a critique of the popular movements that  preceded it ... The Islamists are intellectuals, the products of  modernist enclaves within traditional society; their social origins are  what we have termed the state bourgeoisie – products of the government  education system which only leads to employment in the state machine ...  The Islamists are products of the state educational system. Very few of  them have an education in the arts. On the campus they mostly mix with  the Communists, with whom they are violently opposed, rather that with  the *ulama* \[religious scholars\] towards whom they have an ambivalent attitude. They share many beliefs in common with the *ulama*,  but Islamist thought has developed from contact with the great western  ideologies, which they see as holding the key to the west’s technical  development. For them, the problem is to develop a modern political  ideology based upon Islam, which they see as the only way to come to  terms with the modern world and the best means of confronting foreign  imperialism. [\[30\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1994/xx/islam.htm#n30)

In Algeria the most important recruitment ground for the FIS has been  among Arabic speaking (as opposed to French speaking) high school and  university students, and that wide section of youth that would like to  be students but cannot get college places:

The FIS draws its membership from three sections of  the population: the commercial middle classes, including some who are  quite rich, a mass of young people who are unemployed and excluded from  higher education, forming the new lumpen proletariat of the streets, and  a layer of upwardly mobile Arab speaking intellectuals. These last two  groups are the most numerous and important. [\[31\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1994/xx/islam.htm#n31)

The Islamic intellectuals have made careers for  themselves through their domination of the theological and Arab language  faculties of the universities, using these to gain control of many of  the positions as imams in the mosques and teachers in the *lycees*  (high schools). They form a network that ensures the recruitment of  more Islamists to such positions and the inculcation of Islamist ideas  into the new generation of students. This in turn has enabled them to  exert influence over vast numbers of young people.

Ahmed Rouadia writes that the Islamist groups began to grow from the  mid-1970s onwards, receiving support in the universities from Arab  speaking students who found their lack of fluency in French kept them  from getting jobs in administration, areas of advanced technology and  higher management. [\[32\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1994/xx/islam.htm#n32)  Thus, there was, for instance, a bitter conflict with the principal of  Constantine university in the mid-1980s, who was accused of impugning  the “dignity of Arab language” and “being loyal to French colonialism”  for allowing French to remain the predominant language in the science  and technology faculties [\[33\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1994/xx/islam.htm#n33):

The qualified Arab speakers find access blocked to all  the key sectors, above all in industries requiring technical knowledge  and foreign languages ... The Arab speakers, even if they have diplomas,  cannot get a place in modern industry. For the most part they end by  turning towards the mosque. [\[34\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1994/xx/islam.htm#n34)

The students, the recent Arab speaking graduates and,  above all, the unemployed ex-students form a bridge to the very large  numbers of discontented youth outside the colleges who find they cannot  get college places despite years spent in an inefficient and underfunded  educational system. Thus, although there are now nearly a million  students in secondary education, up to four fifths of them can expect to  fail the bacalauriate – the key to entry into university – and to face a  life of insecurity on the margins of employment: [\[35\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1994/xx/islam.htm#n35)

Integrism \[Islamism\] gets its strength from the social  frustrations which afflict a large part of the youth, those left out of  account by the social and economic system. Its message is simple: If  there is poverty, hardship and frustration, it is because those who have  power do not base themselves on the legitimacy of *shorah* \[consultation\], but simply on force ... The restoration of the Islam of the first years would make the inequalities disappear. [\[36\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1994/xx/islam.htm#n36)

And through its influence over a wide layer of students,  graduates and the intellectual unemployed, Islamism is able to spread  out to dominate the propagation of ideas in the slums and shanty towns  where the expeasants live. Such a movement cannot be described as a  “conservative” movement. The educated, Arab speaking youth do not turn  to Islam because they want things to stay as they are, but because they  believe it offers massive social change. [\[37\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1994/xx/islam.htm#n37)

In Egypt the Islamist movement first developed some 65 years ago,  when Hassan al-Banna formed the Muslim Brotherhood. It grew in the 1930s  and 1940s as disillusionment set in with the failure of the secular  nationalist party, the Wafd, to challenge British domination of the  country. The base of the movement consisted mainly of civil servants and  students, and it was one of the major forces in the university protests  of the late 1940s and early 1950s. [\[38\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1994/xx/islam.htm#n38)  But it spread out to involve some urban labourers and peasants, with a  membership estimated to have peaked at half a million. In building the  movement Banna was quite willing to collaborate with certain figures  close to the Egyptian monarchy, and the right wing of the Wafd looked on  the Brotherhood as a counter to communist influence among workers and  students. [\[39\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1994/xx/islam.htm#n39)

But the Brotherhood could only compete with the communists for the  support of the impoverished middle classes – and via them to sections of  the urban poor – because its religious language concealed a commitment  to reform which went further than its right wing allies wished. Its  objectives were “ultimately incompatible with the perpetuation of the  political, economic and social status quo to which the ruling groups  were dedicated”. This ensured “the liaison between the Muslim  Brotherhood and the conservative rulers would be both unstable and  tenuous”. [\[40\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1994/xx/islam.htm#n40)

The Brotherhood was virtually destroyed once a new military regime  around Abdul Nasser had concentrated full power into its hands in the  early 1950s. Six of the Brotherhood’s leaders were hanged in December  1954 and thousands of its members thrown into concentration camps. An  attempt to revive the movement in the mid-1960s led to still more  executions, but then, after Nasser’s death, his successors Sadat and  Mubarak allowed it to lead a semi-legal existence – provided it avoided  any head on confrontation with the regime. The leadership of what is  sometimes called the “Neo-Islamic Brotherhood” has been willing to  accept these restraints, following a relatively “moderate” and  “reconciliatory” approach, getting large sums of money from members who  were exiled to Saudi Arabia in the 1950s and prospered from the oil  boom. [\[41\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1994/xx/islam.htm#n41)  This has enabled the Brothers to provide “an alternative model of a  Muslim state” with “their banks, social services, educational services  and ... their mosques”. [\[42\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1994/xx/islam.htm#n42)

But it has also led them to lose influence over a new generation of  radical Islamists which has arisen, as the Brotherhood itself originally  did, from the universities and the impoverished section of the “modern”  middle class. These are the Islamists who were responsible for the  assassination of Sadat in 1981 and who have been waging armed struggle  ever since both against the state and against the secular  intelligentsia:

When we speak of the fundamentalists in Egypt, what we  mean is a minority group of people who are even against the Moslem  Brothers ... These groups are composed mainly of youth ... They are very  pure people, they are prepared to sacrifice their lives, to do anything  ... And they are used as the spearheads of the different movements  because they are able to undertake terrorist actions. [\[43\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1994/xx/islam.htm#n43)

The Islamist student associations which became a dominant  force in Egyptian universities during Sadat’s presidency “constituted  the Islamicist movement’s only genuine mass organisations”. [\[44\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1994/xx/islam.htm#n44)  They grew in reaction to conditions in the universities and to the  dismal prospects facing students if they succeeded in graduating:

The number of students rose from slightly less than  200,000 in 1970 to more than half a million in 1977 ... In the absence  of the necessary resources, providing free high education for the  greatest possible number of the country’s youth has produced a system of  cut rate education. [\[45\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1994/xx/islam.htm#n45)

Overcrowding represents a particular problem for female  students, who find themselves subject to all sorts of harassment in the  lecture theatres and overcrowded buses. In response to this situation,

The *jamaa al islamiyya* \[Islamic associations\]  drew their considerable strength from their ability to identify \[these  problems\] and to pose immediate solutions – for instance, using student  unions funds to run minibuses for female students \[giving priority to  those who wore the veil\], calling for separate rows in the lecture  theatres for women and men, organising course revision groups which met  in the mosques, turning out cheap editions of essential textbooks. [\[46\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1994/xx/islam.htm#n46)

Graduating students do not escape the endemic poverty of much of Egyptian society:

Every graduate has the right to public employment.  This measure is actually the purveyor of massive disguised unemployment  in the offices of a swollen administration in which employees are badly  paid ... He can still manage to feed himself by buying the state  subsidised products, but he is unlikely to rise above the bare level of  subsistence ... Almost every state employee has a second or a third job  ... Innumerable employees who sit all morning at desks in one or other  of the countless ministry offices spend the afternoon working as  plumbers or taxi drivers, jobs they perform so inadequately they might  as well be filled by illiterates ... An illiterate peasant woman who  arrives in the city to land a job as a foreigner’s maid will be paid  more or less double the salary of a university assistant lecturer. [\[47\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1994/xx/islam.htm#n47)

The only way to get out of this morass for most graduates  is to get a job abroad, especially in Saudi Arabia or the Gulf states.  And this is not just the only way out of poverty, it is, for most  people, the precondition for getting married in a society where  pre-marital sexual relations are rare.

The Islamists were able to articulate these problems in religious  language. As Kepel writes of one of the leaders of one of the early  Islamist sects, his position does not involve “acting as a fanatic for a  bygone century ... He is putting his finger – in his own way – on a  crucial problem of contemporary Egyptian society”. [\[48\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1994/xx/islam.htm#n48)

As in Algeria, once the Islamists had established a mass base in the  universities, they were then in a situation to spread out into a wider  milieu – the milieu of the impoverished streets of the cities where the  students and ex-students mixed with a mass of other people scrabbling  for a livelihood. This began to happen after the regime clamped down  hard on the Islamist movement in the universities following the  negotiation of the peace agreement with Israel in the late 1970s. “Far  from halting the *jamaa*, however, this harassment gave them a second wind ... the message of the *jamaa* now began to spread beyond the world of students. Islamicist cadres and agitators went to preach in the poor neighbourhoods”. [\[49\]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1994/xx/islam.htm#n49)",,,,,,2021-05-27 16:54:49

I only ask because my family and I holidayed in Tunisia sometime in 2000 (I was only 4 years old at that time so obviously I had no awareness of or interest in politics and world affairs) and it was only two years ago, through watching documentaries on YouTube, that I learned about the 2011 Arab Spring in which Ben Ali was of course ousted along with Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Muammar Gaddafi of Libya. Although my holiday preceded these events by more than 10 years, and even though I've never come across anything that confirms or even suggests that Ben Ali was anti-Western or was on bad terms with the West in either 2000 or the final year of his regime, I've always had the thought ""Oh my God! So this guy was in power when I was there on holiday!"" and I've always been interested to hear from a native Tunisian perspective how Ben Ali personally felt about Western tourists coming to his country, especially Americans or those from the UK like myself. Did he have any personal qualms or grudges about their presence in his country? Or was he not really bothered about it, especially with the monetary contribution this tourism surely made to Tunisia's economy? And, let's say for instance, my family and I had been in Tunisia in 2011, at the time when all of the protests and anti-Ben Ali activity was kicking off, would we still have been as safe as we were 11 years before?

At this point I wish to make clear that I am asking this question out of pure curiosity. I felt that it would make more sense to post it here and hopefully get some native responses than to spend all night on Google and Wikipedia reading things from sources that can't be guaranteed. I understand that the Arab Spring is a sensitive event with ramifications reaching far beyond Tunisia and 2011, and I have no wish or intention to incite any bad feelings or offence.

Thank you very much 👍😊",,,,,,2021-05-29 19:31:05

The session will be at **a place and time of the players group’s convenience (Grand Tunis)**, probably before the end of this month.

Maximum players 6. Newbies are welcome.

A minimum of French speaking is required.
Other than that you don’t need to know the game rules or have specific role playing skills but being motivated to role play is recommended.

The session will be video recorded with my phone.

If i get enough submissions we will probably set a first meeting anywhere just to discuss about the game and the characters you will create. The second meeting will be to play the game.

We’ll see after that if it is worth expanding to a multi-session campaign.

Will answer all your questions here (go crazy i won’t bite)
If you are interested DM me.

À propos de moi: Je suis un doctorat des États-Unis et je travaille sur ma thèse en histoire de l’environnement qui intègre une étude des chotts tunisiens et algériens. J’ai un mois ou deux l’été prochain après un conférence dans l’Angleterre et je veux passer du temps à vivre et travailler en Tunisie.

Premièrement, il ya a quelques archives régionales (et non régionales) que j’essaye d’accéder à Tunis, Alger et Dakar. Mais d’importance égale, en tant qu’historien de l’environnement, c’est très bénéfique de faire l’expérience dans les lieux que l’on écrit. Je ferai probablement des recherches sur le terrain dans et autour de Gabès, et j’espère voyager dans la région près de Chott el-Djerid. En raison de la pertinence de la Tunisie pour mes études et la relative facilité du processus de visa, j’envisage d’établir ma base en Tunisie pour l’été et prendre l’avion pour Alger et Dakar si j’en ai besoin.

Mes questions:

1. Où est un emplacement idéal pour trouver le logement de courte durée ? J’ai trouvé de nombreux appartements sur l’AirBnB qui sont dans mon budget. J’ai cherché principalement à Tunis parce que les archives sont là, mais y a-t-il d’autres villes que je devrais considérer ? Je cherche des villes pas chers qu’ont un type de transports publics et sont tranquilles.
2. Comment sont les transports publics à travers la Tunisie ? Je vais devoir me rendre à Gabès et autres régions.
3. Je parle français et anglais (et russe, mais ce n’est pas pertinent ici). Je suppose que je peux me débrouiller avec le français ? Je ne parle pas l’arabe tunisien, mais je suis ouvert à apprendre un peu de la langue au préalable.
4. Avez-vous autres conseils ou recommendations ? 

Merci ! 

\-----

About me: I am a PhD candidate from the United States, working on an environmental history dissertation that incorporates a study of the Tunisian and Algerian chotts. I have a month or two next summer following a conference in the UK and I am considering spending that time living and working in Tunisia.

First, there are a couple of regional (and not-so-regional) archives that I am trying to access in Tunis, Algiers, and Dakar. But just as important, as an environmental historian, it is hugely beneficial to experience the places you are writing about. I will likely be conducting some field research in and around Gabès, and hope to travel to some of Chott el-Djerid. Due in part to the relevance of Tunisia to my work, as well as the relative ease of the visa process, I’m thinking of setting up my homebase in Tunisia for the summer and flying to Algiers and Dakar if needed/possible.

So, my questions:

1. Where might be an ideal place to find short-term housing? I’ve found a number of places on AirBnB that are within my budget. I’ve looked mostly in Tunis, as that’s where the archives are, but are there any other cities I should consider? Looking for places that are reasonably priced, have some type of public transport, and are relatively laidback.
2. How is public transportation across the country? I’ll most likely reside in Tunis but will certainly need to travel to Gabès and a couple of other areas. 
3. I speak French and English (and Russian, but that’s not relevant here). I am assuming I will be able to get by with French? I don’t know a word of Tunisian Arabic, but am open to learning a little bit before arriving.
4. Any other advice or recommendations?",,,,,,2021-06-08 01:10:37

My wife and I will work on a playlist of MUST HAVEs, but that will amount to 30 or 40% of the duration, we'd like the DJ to improvise the rest. I am Lebanese/Palestinian/Jordanian and my wife is Tunisian/French, we listen to english, arabic, french and spanish songs (Huge variaty, arabic includes tunisian, egyptian, lebanese, palestinian, jordanian, khaleeji, iraqi etc)

nz8pl4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/nz8pl4/whats_your_story_with_school_injustice/,13,What's your story with school injustice ?,"School injustice basically means getting mistreated by someone at school, be it a bully or a teacher or school worker, it's school injustice and most people in this country lived it, especially that our education system is bad and there is definitely so much to tell, in my case, I got a lot of ""Khonar"" to talk about.

Starting from the first year in the elementary school, I had a teacher with a short temper, I once stuck a paper incorrectly in my textbook and when she saw it, she ripped off the whole textbook, she used to punish me a lot for the smallest mistakes and she didn't really sound like she enjoys teaching me anything except treating me like sh\*t.

After some time, the school principal (El modir) did his part too, during the nasheed watani I sang it quietly when the stupid tape was playing and the principal was standing next to us and he heard me, even though I wasn't singing loud or doing anything wrong (at least according to me), he grabbed me violently to his office screaming at me until one of my teachers went to him asking him to forgive me and he did.

Lots of bad stuff happened to me in the elementary and it continued this way in the middle school (college), oh boy it was full of bullies, one of the worst places you would study in, I was doing my homework once outside the school because I wasn't really a good student and a kid walked in front of me stepping on my book that I was holding while I'm sitting on purpose, I raged and started a fight with him and he beat me up and while this was happening, another kid was recording it with his phone and posted it on Facebook and I literally became a meme.

I was laughed at by literally the whole school including my crush that I've always wanted to talk with, not only that but a Surveillant also found it laughable and didn't care much about it, month later and one of the bullies steals the register and the whole class blamed me even though everyone knows I didn't do it, they fully know who actually did it and some of them are part of it but they threw the blame on me, the school principal took me out from the middle of the class and violently hit my face few times and left me outside his office for the whole day then letting his  Surveillants interrogate me like I was in a police station, they didn't let me study in peace for almost two months for a f\*cking register that they could print in a minute, it was their own fault for being bunch of dumbsh\*ts but I get the blame anyways.

Ofcourse there were few, ""good"" times but most of my school life was terrible, I got bullied many times but not only they treated me like sh\*t but also laughed at me, literally, the  Surveillantgeneral took me to a gathering of his colleague and simply started making fun of me with them.

I will never forget the day where I was being annoyed by a kid who threw papers at me in front of the teacher and when I threw them back, she forced me to stand in front of everyone saying my name like a clown to make everyone in the class laugh at me for the rest of the hour, making me a meme again.

Things were getting bad year after year, in high/secondary school, there was once where I came little bit late with some other female classmates and we had to take billet, I didn't go to the administration first and let my classmates go in instead, I wanted to see if they would treat me differently because of my bad past experience with school, after two minutes they got the billet and went to the class and I went in asking for the billet, she told me I can't have in a unfriendly way, I was proven right that I would get mistreated, I tried the same thing again in a another day but this time I took the billet from my classmates and asked the Surveillant to add my name, she was so angry that I found out about what she did and she added my name but warned me to not repeat this again.

later on in that year I found out about my ""moyen"" which was 10:00 and the same Surveillant came to me making fun of me about it, I told my mom about all this and she went her asking her what's wrong with her, guess what she said, ""wej'ho tkolish alih mtaa wahed kloshar"".

So I guess school was never a good experience to me. 

Sorry for the text wall, just wanted to vent about the sh\*t I had to deal with and as you can see, I got plenty of stuff to tell.

**tldr :** I had bad experience in school, so I'm wondering if anyone here had any similar experience.",,,,,,2021-06-13 23:15:02

https://preview.redd.it/hv5psvx389571.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5674b4ec261817670314b35adf365f3634e24a72

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, to the people who have no idea of what i am talking about (and i am sure you are quiet a few), here is some good youtube videos that explain most of the basics :

[What is D&amp;D (FR)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyOhP1TR5Jk&amp;ab_channel=ARTE)

[The game basics (ENG)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoW2CDgztKY&amp;ab_channel=Don%27tStopThinking)

[D&amp;D Social and educative influence in Canada (FR)](https://youtu.be/_CbLGtuWxNs)

Now that you have an idea of what is D&amp;D, just note that it is only one of many other Tabletop RPGs out there (also called Pen &amp; Paper RPGs) with all kind of themes and universes to suit your tastes (Sci-Fi, Western, Horror, etc.). We will cover mostly D&amp;D in this topic as it happens to be the most popular. If you wanna know more about the other game systems (or D&amp;D) you can google it or DM me.

————————————

This being said...

My [first post about gathering players to play D&amp;D in Tunis](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/nrokhn/anyone_up_for_a_session_of_dungeons_dragons_fr/) had some mitigated reactions (but some good ones though). And to be honest, i didn't expect this amount of general negative criticism mindset and ""untrustfullness"" from the people around here (and i know i should have).

So instead of getting sad and disappointed and just give up on the project as the majority of the people would legitimately do in this country toward almost anything positive or worth the enthusiasm, i decided to do the exact opposite. Not because i am motivated or the positive mindset type of people but just because i would like to say : f\*ck whoever brings only skepticism or negativity to the table, especially to the people who don't know sh\*t about your projects but give their opinion regardless.

————————————

**So not only the D&amp;D game is still on (and i am still looking for one more player so DM me if you are interested) but i also decided to create a D&amp;D club here in Tunis.** I don't know how long it will take or even how it could be done but i am doing it anyway :)

What i do know is that a Club is basically a bunch of people gathering to do the same activity and spending money on it to make it easier for all members to have access to the mentioned activity and the necessary equipment to do so. Therefore the question would be :

&amp;#x200B;

**Are you interested in being a member of a D&amp;D club in Tunis and if so please specify what amount of money would you invest in it per month / week / Session ?**

&amp;#x200B;

To give a little bit of details of what i’m thinking about. The minimum offer you would get from the club would be something like : a permanent available DM for one of your characters to run through a full campaign (as long as you are member) and providing the basic material required to play as player or DM (Table &amp; hairs, Dice set, basic rules books, etc.).  You can add to your answer what would you like to see in that club if there is anything specific or if you want to be part of it, what position would you hold ?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you.",,,,,,2021-06-14 16:01:12

I’m US born Tunisian currently living in Canada with my non-Tunisian husband and we decided to come visit Tunis this summer. We both got our two doses so it looks like we won’t need to quarantine. 

We have a total of 10 days in Tunisia and it will be my husbands first time. I have some extended family relatives that we’ll probably visit but we also want to visit the country on our own. Most of my family no longer lives in Tunisia and the few that does are much older than us. 

I haven’t been to Tunis in a while. I don’t even know what to see. We were wondering how easy it is to drive across the country. Can we rent a car at the airport? What are the must see places? Hotels? Cities? Restaurants? We’re looking for the first weeks of August right now.

It's not their democratic system.

It's their undemocratic features. Their autocratic heritage.

UK has a state-controlled religion. French television used to be monitored by an extremely coercive insitution (CSA). Charles de Gaulle famously said that the 5th republic was ""a republican monarchy"". Germany was the very first modern welfare state and had an outstandingly effective bureaucracy...under the authority of dukes and Kaisers.

""Constitutional Liberalism"", a set of institutions protecting liberal principles of freedom of speech, property rights and the sanctity of the individual, is the real source of European prosperity.

Three ingredients are needed : the rule of law to which even the monarch must abide, power separation (it was done thousands of years ago, when the Church claimed it's independance from monarch's authority), and individual sacred rights (born in England with the Magna Carta, then the Bill of Rights).

Democracy without these three elements is doomed to degenerate into anarchy or tyranny. Socrates was put to death democratically following a popular vote. The islamo-fascist regime of the Ayathollahs was brought to power via democracy...

Vienna, in the 1880's. Lueger, a virulent antisemite, founder of the ""Christian-socialist"" party, who compared Jews to locusts that had to be ground as fertilizer, was elected as the new Mayor. Vienna was one of the most liberal city of the West, with many famous artists and intellectuals brimming in Coffee shops. When Lueger was appointed, the Emperor Franz Joseph, a convinced liberal, was like ""oh Hell, no !"" and impeached him. Later in 1933, Lueger's biggest fanboy became the new Chancellor of Germany via democratic vote.

Why would people elect such dangerous lunatics ? Because, contrary to anarchist ideals (looking at you, Nourjen), most people in backward societies fail to see the bigger picture. When your people have a fatalistic mindset, dangerous prejudices against women, minorities, their neighbors, or strange deference for the lords, tax collectors, religious figures and toxic beliefs maintaining them into bondage, you CANNOT ENTRUST THEM A VOTING RIGHT.

If you worked with *Fellahins* in rural Tunisia, you know how much of a pain it is to convince them to use more productive and sustainable agricultural practices.

Now, you're gonna say : who the hell are you to judge what is good for people, you fascist pig ? Let them make their own choices !

I say no.

90% of Egyptian women got their clitoris cut off. 90% ! And the government is not endorsing this, the PEOPLE are ! Do you think the majority of Egyptians would vote against female genital mutilation ? Mothers are the main reinforcer of this barbaric practice ! If Code du Statut Personnel  had not been forced down the throat of Tunisians 70 years ago, their culture would be completely different today.

**Democracy is not the way to progress. Progress is the way to democracy. And so far, in Europe, Taiwan, China, Singapore, South-Korea, liberal autocracy is/was the way to progress. (China is ""semi-liberal"", but that's another story).**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now, Tunisia have arguably been ruled by ""liberal autocrats"" since it's independance, so it seems this model can also be subject to failure. That's because the central government FAILED to liberalize the hearts and minds of ALL Tunisians and became the cesspool of a corrupt mob who forgot about the Bourguibian dream.

Taiwan also hit a brick wall when the liberal autocratic Kuomintang ruled it for such a long time. Industry was failing, corruption was rising. But the population became liberal and educated under its regime. They formed protests and managed to put fresh blood at the head of the state that renewed the liberal objectives of an open society. This would have not been possible with an uneducated Taiwanese populace before Chang Kai Chek's dictatorship. Kuomintang liberalized the country by force, stagnated, lost its legitimacy then got replaced by a democratic regime, with institutions inherited from the autocratic experience.

The ""liberal"" regime of Tunisia of Bourguiba then Ben Ali, was not strong and autocratic enough. It was too weak in the countryside, and failed to completely reform its agriculture to make it really competitive. Archaïc social structures are still there. Only 10% of the GDP make up for the state budget. Without free money from the IMF, UN programme, China, the US and Europe, we would all be starving to death right now.

Why some liberal autocracies fail, while others succeeds ? Well it turns out that war, heavy industrialisation and an agressive open-market policy can mobilize legions to leave their ""comfort zone"" and force people through the agonizing process of social change. Progress IS traumatizing, it's not a comfortable ride at all.

The horrible stress that forced Europeans to innovate themselves to death are NOT present in other parts of the world anymore (World Wars, Imperialism, industrial revolution that created the first malleable ""Masses"", and so on.)

Some argue that Communist regimes could artificially induce this kind of ""stress"" on their population, as in Tanzania and Indonesia for instance. But liberal principles were still essential in the long term.

We have an excellent intelligentsia, brilliant engineers and researchers. We have a talented Diaspora, building succesful businesses all around the world. The only obstacle to progress is the bureaucracy. It's the law. It's the corrupted groups of interests who do anything in their power to impeach new-comers from building more efficient companies and institutions. And in this case, unfortunately, it seems a provisory autocratic system is the only way to destroy these failed organizations, to anhihilate limiting beliefs and fatalistic mindsets plaguing the hearts and minds of so many Tunisians. To consolidate a true Nation-State, a strong national identity, and a powerful deference to progress and the betterment of the future generations.

&amp;#x200B;

It turns out the Army is very liberal. Because Tunisia is/used to be a police-state, not a military one. It escaped state control and remained true to its liberal ideals, since Ali Pacha and the Bardo military school. Way way before Bourguiba, Tunisian elites already had liberal principles in their veins !

I know many people who served there. It's a very feminist and progressive institution. They hate the guts of Islamists and corrupted bureaucrats. Some high graders I know are even waiting for an excuse to seize power and imprison all the ""traitors"" who are working to keep the status quo running. They have lists of people in UGTT, UTICA, STEG-SONEDE, political party and many other institutions they KNOW are responsible for the current economic stagnation. But they keep it down, for now...

Why tunisians claim they are arabs and brag about it instead of their real origin ?

why are we called arabs ? 

Do you feel close to arabs in the gulf peninsula ?

Should we restore our real identity ?

o4u8d4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/o4u8d4/today_i_fu_up/,138,Today I Fu**** Up,"Well, it finally happened.

Today I was waiting for a taxi under the scorching heat. There was a girl waiting on the other side so we were both kinda competing.

Two guys driving a car pass by the girl and start catcalling her because ""soret'ha 3iryena"" (her belly is showing)

Immediately karma hits and they run into an old man riding a bike who was carrying all kinda' shit (old bread, water bottles, ect....)

Chaos ensues.

They start arguing with eachother until the driver moves a bit further to park the car (this I did not know at the time, keep it in mind)

I come in to help the old man and this dude hits me with:

"" rit min jorit'ha il 9a7ba shnowa li sar "" (you see what happened because of this bitch)

Somehow, in typical Tunisian fashion, they found a way to blame the girl even though they're the ones who fucked up

To which I replied:

""  lé ya rajil ma ta3milsh haka 3ada "" (come on' man, don't be like that)

Keep in mind, at this point I was still calm and I was trying to deescalate the situation.

So I tried to put all the stuff back on his bike but I couldn't.

""thankfully"" a big ass dude came by to help me, I could only see his leg but I thanked him and said:

"" rit hal mabna' shnowa sar min jorithom"" (**see what happened because of these fucks**)

^(Note: Miboun means gay/faggot (thank you Consistent-Energy-91@)), ^(but we use it in Tunisia to mean all kinds of shit depending on the situation.)

He replied:

"" ma3neha ena miboun? "" (**so I am the fucker?**) (he took it literally)

Fuck.

""ey inti miboun"" (yea you are)

So this big ass dude towered over me and I was talking shit like nobody's business. I am not a feminist, but I see this behavior in my family and with my friends all the time and I shut it down at every opportunity so I wasn't gonna shut my stupid mouth today.

Next thing you know, this dude says:

""wallahi ma nadhrbik ya ta7an, wallah ma nadhrbik"" (**I swear Imma' kick yo ass bitch, I'ma kick yo ass**)

I kept running my stupid mouth, but thankfully a pizza guy and 3 more guys came out of the restaurant and saved my little bitch ass by separating the two of us.

I thought it was over.

It wasn't.

I see a big ass fat fuck coming behind me who turned out to be the passenger.

This dude was somehow even bigger and he had a mean tan on him.

""shimda5lek, t7ib nadhrbek?!"" (**it's none of your business, you want me to beat you up?)**

I threatened that I was gonna call the cops on him (it would never work, but I had to try)

Here comes the pizza guy again to save the day and separate the two us once more.

So I go back to my spot to find the taxi. The girl is gone. I look across the street to see if the 2nd big ass dude is still there.

He's still there. I stare at him. He stares at me. This goes on for what felt like an eternity. He knows I am challenging him. I am challenging him because I am a dumb stupid fuck.

He comes my way.

Fuck.

I quickly memorize the car plates.

He yells

""bech nadhrbik, wallahi ma nadhrbik"" **(I am gonna hit you, I swear I am gonna beat you)**

I yell:

""Ya ta7aaaaaan"" (**untranslatable**)

I then yell the license plate as loud as I could.

Everybody hears it. He backs off and goes back to the car.

Anyways, some more bullshit happen.

Moral of the story is:

**Praise the pizza guy**",,,,,,2021-06-21 12:42:58

I have no idea about university life and what universities I should go to. I have checked some videos on the internet on orientation advice and I can't make a clear choice. I keep worrying about my grade, that it won't be high enough to be accepted in high-quality universities. 
I'm scared that I will be forced to study something I don't like, that I will suffer from unemployment after I finish. 
I studied mathematics (bac maths), I'd say my average would be around ~14 (~140ish score).
If you have any suggestion of what would be my best option here please let me know, it means a lot.

I am a 19M from an Asian Country.  
I met this one Tunisian Girl on Instagram, she initially DMed me out of nowhere on Instagram. Since I am from a different time zone, we do not really have a live conversation, I get her replies when I am sleeping (almost midnight here, and when it's like an evening in Tunisia). She is really nice, she is really kind, supportive and she is really caring too. She is probably giving her high school exams currently to join undergraduate I guess.  


Now coming to the point, I feel there is some cultural as well as the religious difference between me and her. I just wanted to know what are Tunisian girls like in general.   
My question is what is the dating culture like in Tunisia? What do Tunisian girls like the most? How to make her feel special and win her heart?  
I do not know even if she uses this subreddit or not. If she sees this post, she will surely know who I am, and I guess, things will either go worse or best from here.",,,,,,2021-06-25 12:51:56

I mean I believe in freedom of speech so they can say whatever, but I'm just curious, what's causing that!

Tunisian citizens are stopped and denied entry to the Island, a part of Tunisia, for no reason.
The police/guard are simply saying ""we have orders"".

Even People with reservation in hotels are not permitted to enter the Island. The bastards aren't letting anyone through unless the ID says you're resident of Medenine Governorate.

Football fans are being discriminated against based on the government of residency, based on where they live. There was no official state of emergency declared, there was no announcement, people are just being stopped from taking roads in their country (freedom of travel inside the republic is supposedly a constitutional right).
It's a blow to every right there is, it's a kick in the groin for those who pretend they live in a state of law and rights. It is another confirmation, as if we needed more, that the police state never died. That the dictatorship is well alive and strong as ever.

And the fact that very few, if any, media reported that fact, is all the confirmation I need that freedom of speech is non existent in this country, when thousands of people are prevented to enter Jerba, and no media cares.

I hate this country, l would sell it for change. I'll never love it. There is nothing to love. And when people find the will to live by being there for something they love, the institution refuses to let the hope live. ""They"" just can't keep themselves from crushing the only passion people still have.

However , the relative I mentioned before have studied in tunisia for 5 years (2 years prepa monfleury, 3 years ecole polytechnique) and then went to US to get his master's degree and Doctorat, which means that those 5 years are the equivalent of a bachelor's degree.

Hey Folks, maybe this sounds stupid to post such thing on reddit, but desperation has lead me here. 

So anyways, I'm a vocational student in grand Tunis, as you know in Tunisia we are during summer holidays now and ***I need a job***. Unfortunately, I'm not skilled nor interested in IT so programming or designing aren't my field of interest (bac lettres 3a9liya xD).

Long story short, I've been relentlessly applying in several call centers looking for a suitable job for my profile (English/Arabic/French/**Italian** (**beginner lvl**) ) yet, I didn't receive a good offer except French call centers. Therefore, I'm ""summoning"" you for recommendations, advice, or any information about a **remote work** (offshore/onshore), doesn't matter the operation, ***I'm really in need for money in this particular moment.*** People are being dismissed and kicked from call centers (200 From Teleperformance in the last couple weeks) I don't wanna be humiliated by a French company IN MY COUNTRY, although, I'm expecting a severe full lockdown maybe in the next few days or even hours since many Tunisian states are crawling towards extinction due to Covid.

My English is advanced, with acceptable French and Arabic is my native tongue. 

And thanks in advance.",,,,,,2021-06-29 12:48:48

I called the vaccination team they told me to send an email to pasteur institute, I sent one week ago but no reply.
I called them again they asked me to have the autorisation from government president, I also sent an email but no reply. 

Is there any other option for Tunisian who want to get vaccinated for professional reasons ??

And I want to have your opinion on what university to choose?

Tek-up is obviously the underdog but I think people are choosing Esprit just because ""E s p r i t"".

I heard Tek-up have a decent curriculum and offers a lot of certification and opportunities. whereas Esprit have the advantage of a recognized degree, Even internationally.

  
The comparison can be narrowed down to these factors:

* Quality of education / Price
* Opportunity of work afterwords (nationally and Internationally)
* Extra-curriculum activities: clubs, social life...
* Extras: Certification, forums, courses, competition...  


PS: To be honest I am after the engineering degree not the actual curriculum; I have sufficient technical skills already and i can work on improving them myself and through work. But that doesn't mean I would go for a trashy curriculum/degree.

I always drop out and I ended up wasting 6 years of my life. The last year I started a BTS informatique de gestion and I made a friend who really pushed me to finish the year when I wanted to let go, and I feel like I got more stable and that my episodes were mild compared to the past. Today I received a mail saying I succeeded and got a 16 something average. It's not much but it kinda made me happy that I persevered through the pain. It will be a reference for me everytime I wanna quit something. I've been contemplating doing a licence at UVT (since I can't afford to make my parents pay huge amounts of money for rent and private studies anymore). I wanted to study accounting but I was wondering if it'll be worth it. Will I be able to hold a job if I graduate older than everyone else and if not should I do an IOT degree instead?

People always told me they could see me become a doctor because of how delicate and nice they see me, but I'm really scared I might not do well in med school because everyone says it's very difficult. (Note: I study in a pioneer highschool, ik that doesn't mean sh1t but I just thought I'd mention it) Besides, I haven't told anyone about this, and I really don't want to end up unemployed kekw.

بعض الحقائق :

- أول اتفاقية إقتصادية بين تونس و قطر تعود لسنة 1982

- الصندوق ينشط من 2002.

- الإتفاقية صححها يوسف الشاهد في 2019 في عهد المرحوم الباجي قايد السبسي، المذكرة الي تبنات عليها الإتفاقية توقعت في 29 نوفمبر 2016 و الزميل مبروك كرشيد وقتها وزير و المحترمة سعيدة قراش مستشارة في القصر الرئاسي.

-المجلس الوزاري الذي صادق على تمرير الإتفاقية بالبرلمان في ديسمبر 2019 فيه كمال مرجان (مبادرة)  سمير بالطيب (مسار)

- الإتفاقية تناقشت في اللجنة في عهد حكومة إلياس الفخفاخ، الي حزامه وقتها تيار و شعب.

- نص الإتفافية منشور و متوفر للعموم.

- نفس الإتفاقية و البنود الي فيها هي متع GIZ الالمانية و ال USAID و AFD الفرنسية و منظمة الفرنكوفونية (الي تنشط عندها عقود في تونس و إتفاقيتها تعدات الدورة البرلمانية هذه).

- الصندوق دعم 30 startup تونسية بقيمة 26 مليار.

- الصندوق بنى مركز نموذجي لتحويل المنتاجات الفلاحية.
 
- الصندوق دعم 20 تعاونية فلاحية و مول حفر 22 بئر عميقة.

- الصندوق بنى 50 مسكن إجتماعي في الكاف و 98 في المهدية و سيدي بوزيد و القيروان.

- الصندوق بنى مجمع سكني في السيجومي فيه 800 مسكن إجتماعي.

- الصندوق عطى 70 مليار قروض ميسرة مباشرة لدعم المؤسسات الصغرى.

- الصندوق بنى و جهز بالكامل 10 مستوصفات.

- الصندوق بنى 5 مدارس في أماكن نائية.

- أكثر من 100 مليون دولار قيمة إستثماراته في تونس و خلق 70 ألف موطن شغل

نزيد، للمقارنة :

قيمة الإستثمارات القطرية في فرانسا، في الشركات المدرجة في بورصة cac40  توصل 7,6 مليار أورو :
- 13% من lagardere
- 7% من Vinci
- 5% من Total

4 مليار يورو إستثمارات عقارية (وتلة كيما Royal Monceau الليلة فيه ب 6000 أورو و وتيل Concorde Lafayette..)

نحكيو على الPSG ؟ على Le printemps ؟ 

زعمة فرانسا و إستخباراتها و بورصتها ما فاقوش بيهم؟ فاقوا بيهم الشلايك الي عندنا؟؟

و هذه فقط فرانسا، نحكيلكم على ألمانيا و اللكسمبورغ؟
تي قطر تملك 17% في فولسفاكن، كيفاش إمالة شلايكنا أكثر فهم و وطنية من أنجلا ميركل؟

خلي نجيو من حيث المبدأ، إذا الإتفاقية إستعمارية و تمس من السيادة الوطنية، فيجب إلغائها و إلغاء كل الإتفافيات المماثلة مع جميع الدول، هكة و إلا لا؟ تي جاوبوني :) 

حقة، الإتفاقية مافيهاش، تملك الأراضي الفلاحية!

نزيدكم، البند متع العمالة الأجنبية عادي جدا! ياخي GIZ تجيب مدير ألماني و ال AFD مديريها فرنسيس.. تي هي Tunisair كي تحل agence في الخارج تجيب مدير تونسي  من تونس!

في الإخر، نفس البنود، جماعة الكرامة عملوا طاولة و كراسي على الفرنكوفونية و صوتوا على هذه و الأخرين عملوا طاولة و كراسي على هذه و طفاو الضو على الأخرى!

نفاق بدورو إديولوجي شعبوي رخيص ما يحطش مصلحة تونس قدامه!

صوتت مع الزوز إتفاقيات لأني قدرت إنه فيهم مصلحة لبلادنا! و سعيد بتصويتي و فرحان بيه و كان عن قناعة و تفكير و تمحص بعيد على التوتر و الرقص على تار بوفلس متع أختااااااااااااه إحذرييييي :)

كنائب مسؤول، ما يهمني و ما يعنيني هو مصلحة بلادي التي أقسمت على الحرص عليها، كان ثمة نواب ما عندهاش الشجاعة باش تواجه الجهل و البهامة و تختار تصويتها شعبويا  على حساب مصلحة تونس، الحمد الله لست منهم!

هذا الصندوق، فيه منفعة لتونس، شروطه عادية و خذات كيفها كل المنظمات و الصناديق.

كل المعطيات المذكورة أعلاه متوفرة على الأنترنات، أي شخص صادق ينجم يثبت منها.

تو هل النهضة سمسارة؟ نعم، دائما، من أول الدنيا و إلى يوم يبعثون.
نحاربوهم موش على حساب مصلحة بلادنا! كيما نحاربو سمسارة الإمارات الي مستعدين يحطو صوابعهم في عينين بلادنا لأجل من يدفع أكثر!

راهو ثمة ناس كي القرضاوي يجيبو بن علي يولي باهي، نفس القرضاوي يولي خايب مبعد :) نفس القرضاوي راهو !نفس الكذابة  الي يقولوا الأمريكان يتجسسوا على المجلس بال NDI و بعد يمشيو يتشلقحوا يتصوروا مع سفير الأمريكان الي قالو يتجسس علينا :) هوما بيدهم متع حزب الليكود الدستوري الحر : مع القضية الفلسطينية تفليما و لما تعرض تسريع تجريم التطبيع على مكتب المجلس صوتوا ضد :) !  

هاذوكم منافقين بودورو، يهمهم ال bailleur de fonds متاعهم، أكثر من مصلحة تونس، نحبك فايق ولد أختي، حل google و ثبت وحدك ما تخليهمش يزكموك، هاني فسرتلك و بالفلاقي!

الا لااا لاااا لاااا أح أح لاااااا لاااا لاااا أح أح  لم تكن مسرحية لأجل الوطن كيما غلطوكم، كانت مسرحية لأجل أنفسهم ضد مصلحة الوطن.

Now that I Finished, I got 15.93 with a Score of approx. 159.6 and with the 7% Advantage in Tunisia I get approx. 170 Score. (M = 13; SP= 17.25; ALGO=20).

EDIT: BAC INFO btw!

When I calculated my score using INSAT and ISI formulas I can enroll in both schools.

Formula Sources: [http://www.guide-orientation.rnu.tn/index.php](http://www.guide-orientation.rnu.tn/index.php)

&amp;#x200B;

Alright the problem is:

1- I Heard ISI is bad in terms of Location, Some Teachers but is good in terms of students.

2-I heard that INSAT has a nice building but depressing people in it and is just boring.

3- I heard that Esprit seems the best way to go since it offers (might even offer better) opportunities abroad but just has bad education over the years.

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel like Esprit is a balance between ISI and INSAT, But is it really true? And are these 3 problems true to you guys who study there?

odsbww,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/odsbww/personnality_disorders_in_tunisia_are_waaay_more/,70,"Personnality disorders in Tunisia are waaay more common and often regarded as ""هذيكا هيا طبيعتو"" instead of actually trying to identify the pathological pattern and help people fix their issues.","So personnality disorders aren't actual diseases like depression / bipolar disorder/ schizophrenia but rather a risk factor to these illnesses.

They are a way of interaction with the outside environement adopted by an individual over a prolonged period of time.  They are characterized by an aberrant  emotional,cognition and behavioural patterns exhibited across many situations. They are devided into 3 clusters (A:odd /B:Dramatic/C:anxious that share some charecterstics)

There are many personnality disorders but the most common ones in Tunisia  according to gender are:

For men: Paranoid personnality disorder: So often men with this personnality disroder will be jealous/mistrust others/suspiscious and often interpret others action as hostile.

For women:Histrionic personnality disorder:So women with this personnality disorder will often seek attention and exagerate their behaviours and emotions.Basically they are waaay over dramatic and sexually provocative so they can seek stimulation and validation.

The interesting thing is that these last years the pattern is changing and more men are becoming histrionic/more women becoming paranoid.(this lacks the data to back it up as i didn't find the descriptive  study on pub med made by the professor who told me this so take it with a grain of salt).

Also worth mention 3 others PD that are quite easily identifiable:

Anti social personnality disorder: these individuals often violate others rights( سرقة ، ضرب ...)  and have self bloated image and often blame society for their issues (#باندي الحومة)

Narcissistic personnality disorder:  individuals will seek admiration from others //have exagerrated feelings of self importance 

Borderline personnality disorder: this one is interesting cause it imitates bipolar disorder so much the diffrence between them is that BPD is more centered around the emotional side of things ( shifting between  intense love and hate) people with this personnality will often have impulsive behaviour  and chaotic relationships.



The reason i post this is to raise awarness and help you identify people with such personnalities  so the next time you interact with them you can identify a certain pattern and protect yourself from getting manipulated and manage to deal with them correctly.",,,,,,2021-07-04 20:26:31

Why are Tunisian drivers behave like psychopaths ?,"Lately I saw many accidents (i even saw a dead body) on the road. People looked at it as if it was normal… they re probably used to it.

Tunisian people are known to have a slow pace at work and in life in general (farniente lifestyle) but when it comes to driving (and other aspects of social behaviour like standing in the line)  Tunisians increasingly behave like psychopaths, leading to stupid accidents, fights, and avoidable drama. 

Examples:
- Flashing you to force you to go faster (even if you are already above speed limit) and getting completely mad if you can’t (or don’t want) move to the side.

- using hazard warning lights to drive faster (as if putting them gave you more rights)

- Not looking at the side when crossing the road at a stop sign

- not giving you enough space in two-way streets (showing dominance) especially with trucks and 4x4

- driving in reverse sense especially in in roundabouts

- parking in the worst possible place Making everybody’s life impossible

I think behaviours like these are extremely unhealthy and reveal the true nature of this country’s tolerance for mediocrity.",,,,,,2021-07-04 20:30:12

Does anyone know how i can reschedule an appointment using their poor excuse of a website or do i just make a new one and pay again?

----------------

In spetember 2016, i posted this thread here: 

[My monthly income since i decided to start Freelancing in 2012 + overall details on each period. Feel free to ask anything, i'll be glad to help](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/52xnyc/my_monthly_income_since_i_decided_to_start/)

I answered a lot of common questions in that thread so make sure to read it whenever you can, am also still doing ""freelancing"" sort of speak, am not constantly hunting for client anymore though, been working on a long term projects for years now, and i have my own company here (SUARL totalement exportatrice) in order to legitimize the whole thing, money is really good and i still work from home, feel free to ask anything.

&amp;nbsp;

With that said, here are some answers for some of the frequently asked questions: 


------

#FAQ 
#Tunisia-related (money, legal shit, etc ...)

**How do i get paid ?**

* It depends, if you work with one of the famous platforms (upwork, fiverr) then you could use a payoneer card, but if you meet your client ""randomly"" in some forum (r/forhire, r/gameDevClassifieds, /r/slavelabour ) then you just have to talk it out, in the past i used :

* Payoneer card-to-card payement (client must have a payoneer card)

* Westerunion (expensive, avoid that)

* [WorldRemit](https://www.worldremit.com/en/tunisia/faq/cash-pickup#where-can-my-recipient-collect-the-funds-in-tunisia) (super cheap WesternUnion alternative)

* Bank wire (but don't do it for large amounts, anything less han 2000tnd should be fine)

&amp;nbsp;

**Does payoneer work in Tunisia ?**

* Yes (but you really can't be a freelancer if you can't make a simple google search...)

&amp;nbsp;

**Will they send me a MasterCard to my home??**

* yes

&amp;nbsp;

**W diwena 😲??? ma yotlbouch 3leya rachwa ??**

* No

&amp;nbsp;

**Can i send money from payoneer directly to my tunisian bank account?**

* Yes

&amp;nbsp;

**What ATM do you use with Payoneer and how much they cost**

* I never used Payoneer credit card in a Tunisian ATM since 2016, i only use it online or when i travel. 

* The fees are available in [Payoneer's fee page](https://www.payoneer.com/about/fees/)

* No the Tunisian government won't bother you.

&amp;nbsp;


**can i link a tunisian paypal account to payoneer account ?**

* Yes

&amp;nbsp;

**can i use that paypal account to buy things ?**

* Most of the time yes (ebay, steam, g2a, etc..), but it doesn't work for subscriptions (like Netflix), for that you have to use your payoneer Mastercard directly, also some other services that doesn't have our countries in their supported list (like Nintendo and Playstation) won't accept neither your paypal nor your payoneer card


&amp;nbsp;

**can i use that paypal account to receive money?**

* No


&amp;nbsp;

**I don't have a payoneer account yet, and i need to pay some international fees (eg: Google/Apple dev account fees)**

* Get a ""Carte technologique""

&amp;nbsp;

**My Client doesn't have a payoneer card what should i do?**

* When it comes to working with beginners, most clients would like to work with you through a proxy-service (fiverr, upwork, etc..), so they can get a refund when you do a terrible job (and leave you a bad review that will hunt you for years)

* If you still somehow found a client ""in the wild"", and they really wanna work with you, then WorldRemit is the easiest and fastest way to get paid, it's basicaly WesternUnion but way cheaper, and your client can pay with whatever they want, the only ""limitation"" for it is that it only works with BH (Bank d'habitat) you don't need to have a bank account, but you need to go to a BG agency and give them the transiction ID, kinda like getting a ""ماندا"" from your local post office.

* About WorldRemit, last time i used it was in 2017, and back then, despite the service being called WorldRemit in the official website, the bank agent that i dealt with (BH-Benzart) kept calling it **MoneyTrans**, so if you go there and ask about WorldRemit and they give you the usual ""nope"", make sure to ask about MoneyTrans too.

&amp;nbsp;

**My freelancing business is getting stable income and i want to legitimize it** 

* Start a company, it doesn't cost much at all, and there is so many tax benefits for people in this line of works (assuming all of your clients are foreigners who pays in Euro/USD) 


&amp;nbsp;


**Is there a ""Freelancer"" status in Tunisia bech n7ot'ha fi bita9et ta3rif w nodhher cool 😎?**

* No and وكيل شركة is cooler.

&amp;nbsp;


**What are the benefits of starting a company ?? i'll be just paying taxes to this incompetent corrupt government 😠**

* It's the only way that will allow you to buy expensive things legally (car, piece of land, house, etc..)

* It's also the best and fastest way if you wanna be able to travel.

* You wont have طالب in your بطاقة تعريف  when you're clearly older than my dad...

* Extra social respect-points anywhere you go.

* Huge tax benefits if you open an international company (totalement exportatrice).

* You must do it anyway if you keep receiving ""large"" amount of money regularly (+2k/month), if you don't, it can be considered tax evasion. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Can i send you a chat request ?** 

* unless it's an emergency and your question is VERY specific to you, i prefer that you comment here so other will benefit from it, i also hate Chat in general, so in case you still need some specific answers that for some reason you don't want them answered here, then send a direct message with all the details and i'll get back to you as soon as i can.

* TLl;DR: no chat.

-------------------------

#General Freelancing FAQ:

**For Programmers:**

**What should i learn**

* Whatever field you're a fan of, but the easiest one to make money with online are (in no particular order): 

* iOs and/or Android development

* Tasks Automation (bots, etc..)

* Web dev

* Game dev

* Small crossplatform apps

but don't expect to get a job ONLINE for cyber-security or some big banking software, always think about the fact that you are a total stranger to the client, so no matter how good you are, no one is gonna trust you with something worth millions of dollars *ONLINE*

&amp;nbsp;

Also, if you are a programmer (intermediate or expert) and you're not making **at least** an extra $500 a month from side-gig as a freelancer, then you're wasting a great opportunity to make money, and you're also a total idiot and a disgrace to us programmers :) 

&amp;nbsp;

**I am a programmer, but i don't know how to start**

* are you really ? because if by ""programmer"" you mean that you just finished 18 theoretical exams in college but have no real project at all then you are delusional, it's like calling yourself a ""writer"" simply because you graduated from ""bac lettre"", or a musician simply because you attempted to learn an instrument for one year, so at this point, you are not a programmer, you are simply a student. 

* Start making real projects, because you will NEVER get any client if you just keep learning the theory, and actually, it is a fact that most theories you learn will vanish from your skill-set if you don't practice them often enough, so the question is really simple: 

* **Can i show something to the client that will seduce them to work with me?**

* And by that i mean something along the field of the client, you can't have a portfolio full of websites, and then try to apply for a game dev job, but if you don't have a portfolio at all, then *nobody* is gonna hire you 5atrek jebt 15 fel ISET lol

* And finally, this is not at all a question related to Tunisia, beginners struggle is universal, doesn't matter if you're American or Indian, as a matter of fact, as a beginner, you have an advantage over 1st world countries because as a 20y.o from a poor/average family, a $500/month will make you feel like King Salman, but in the US this is fuck all and no one would bother with it, so use that to your advantage. 

* Google it! there is countless of reddit, youtube and various other forums post about ""getting started with freelancing"" tips, *especially* for programmers, some fields are obviously harder than other, some is hard purely because of the skill they require, and other are hard because of how saturated they are (by Indians), but it is what it is, and the whole point of this post is to show you that someone from the same background of you has made it, which mean you can make it.

&amp;nbsp;

**For Designers:**

I don't know what should you learn, but i did hire freelance designers in the past, and the one thing i am sure of is that clients always look for ""Good final scene"", here is an example of a VERY SIMPLE 3D models but with AMAZING presentation:

* https://dribbble.com/MohChahin

And here is an example of a bad portfolio: 

* https://www.artstation.com/katisalminen

Despite the second one having models that are much more complex than the first one, I think you can all tell which one is getting more job offers.

As as a beginner designers and even intermediate/expert, keep in mind that you are gonna be working with clients who expects you to do EVERYTHING, and a well presented simple scene is way more attractive than a very technically-heavy model that looks like shit, the technical thing might be appreciated by other artists/experts, but clients who only need one job done usually never have that knowledge and only judge you as a ""casual"" person.

&amp;nbsp;


**I don't have any Skill to sell online, am i fucked ?** 

Not really, you can always try Dropshipping, also brows /r/slavelabour  to get some ideas, but in this department usually a paypal account to receive money is crucial, so maybe try dropshipping ? (don't ask me what it is, google it), or you can bite the bullet and learn a proper skill ?

Because even if you chose dropshipping or any other e-commerce thing, the main issue is that for Skilled-Freelance the entry-fee is basically free (after aquiring the skill of course), for you however, you need a capital, to host your website, pay for good SEO, pay for Social media marketing, etc..

But it is a profitable thing nonetheless, the waiting time to make money here is also usually higher than selling your skill, so you need to be patient. 

&amp;nbsp;

**I am not motivated enough, please help me master 😭**

I'm a 24-year-old college student, and I will be applying to university in 2021Therefore, I need to use this year as good preparation for the degree I choose - but that's the problem. I cannot decide.  


One option is to complete a master in marketing   and become a community manager or marketer This will take me 2 years including 2 years work experience to, I really enjoy  managing social media platforms like Instagram, YouTube, TikTok etc.   


My other choice is to become a Salesperson or data analysis  expert  I know that this will take me most of my working life to achieve, as a professorial title doesn't come easy. I am absolutely passionate about all new things, especially playing with numbers and stat s - I could talk for hours. Ever since I can remember, I have been fascinated by the statistics and probability in the high school. However, job security in this degree field is not great (high competition), and it's not exactly a growing field ether. If I eventually manage to become an expert, the salary will be very good I've heard many people set out to become  assistance  but never end up there...  


To conclude, the Architecture would give a decent amount of enjoyment and a secure job, but it doesn't really excite me as much as Ancient History.  


What I'm really asking is: can someone clear my vision, I'm trying to brainstorm my mind and see everything from a different angle

fortunately i was able to reach baccalaureate but after 2 unsuccessful attempts i opted to hustling my way through life (not the best decision i admit, I'm not the brightest tool in the shed after all) and sticking to what i was already doing low income jobs in different fields ranging from tourism, construction sites, sales person, raising small animals to sell … i know for a fact that i didn't get any real work experience nor life skills that i can make a decent living out of in the long run i didn't realized that at first because i was only working out of necessity  with no focus on future plan whatsoever, i couldn't even keep a good social network duo my introverted personality.

i thought of many ways i can improve my situation but unfortunately non of which has payed off so far, been planning to save up some money to get a professional formation diploma through a night school but I'm still indecisive about which path i should be pursuing.

We send aboard each year 70 students straight after bac and 120 after 2 years of study in ipest. Which I think is a lot of money and I am really questioning its utility. With a simple look at past student's LinkedIns and CVs I realized they never really did amount to anything ( or at least to what was expected from them as the elites of the country ). The majority don't even bother with doctorate school and jump directly to the workforce and never come back.

Well nothing is wrong with that but really can't they do the same form here ? does the country need to sponsor their education so they can get jobs abroad?

Do they think a 15/16 child can choose correctly between info or eco ? and what if he/she changes his/her decisions later? You are basically trapped.

Also, How will being an info/technique/eco student help you later? You will basically start everything from scratch in university.

At this point, I think the sole purpose of it is to save other majors from the advanced math classes math students take.

Later on, a math student will only choose a scientific major, eco students will only choose commerce or business and lettre students will only choose law and literature studies which I think is really really bad.

In other countries law is the most competitive major and only people with top math grades get into it. Here they make it socially unacceptable to do so.

I think we should all have the same education system during high school, have fewer/easier math classes for all , and graduate at the age of 18 instead of 19 and from there you can choose what you like freely and without pressure!",,,,,,2021-07-11 17:05:36

I've heard import taxes are high? Does anyone have a link to any information on this?

How much does the government get involved with the process of establishing a walk In business? 

Where are prime locations for a successful business in Tunisia? (I'm aware there are many factors to this such as the business it self)

Just recently in Ariana, in Riadh el Andalous, Tunisie Telecom put an ad (not really an ad) saying “Pour votre confort, Tunisie Telecom installe la fibre optique” and this was 7 days ago (They had cables and everything ready). Since I loved the fact that they were introducing the Fiber Optic, I kept following their work (just like 3 times a day I pass by). The thing is, all I’ve seen was them just placing a new small box that was labeled (TT logo) in the entrance of Riadh el Andalous and they spent some days working on it but I haven’t seen them do the actual cable work and them being there lasted only for 4 days then there is no trace of them. 
My questions:

Does anyone know how this installation works in Tunisia?
Is it true that they scam some people by not finishing the whole installation and just putting VDSL cables to finish the line?
How complicated is it?
How long does it take to finish?

Side note: I have actually checked their e-shop where you can check if you are eligible for fiber using the map but it hasn’t changed…

Thanks and I’m really curious about this cus we currently have 12MBPS and that’s the max we have here we can’t reach more than that and it’s sad that most of Ariana is not covered by Fiber (Afaik only Menzah and ennasr have fiber in Ariana close by)",,,,,,2021-07-13 00:11:30

**Why I want to study in Germany ?**

\-Okay, I chose germany bcz i don't like frensh at all althrough i was accepted by many Frensh Universities (Campus France) and i think that it will be hard for me to integrate in the frensh community and may face issues in university bcz they expect you to master the language 3arks germany eli ta3tik one year bech tet3alm lougha w mbaad tabda ta9ra so i think that i have a chance in germany more in france.

\-I did my research on the universities there and they have high ranking on EU and worldwide mentioning TU Munchen and RWTH AACHEN w zid fama barcha twensa ya9raw fehom so ITS POSSIBLE. and thats better than doing INSAT or Prepa lena f tounes . YES i know eli heya te5ou akther wa9t w effort but it seems worth it.

\-I want to discover myself and experience life in general, i have never traveled before in my life so i see it as an adventure that will make me stronger as a person and also will provide me a good quality education (im not saying INSAT isn't good) but German Universities are better (If you have an other opinion feel free to comment pls).

Of course there are CONS like leaving home at a young age , different culture , feeling lonely most of the time etc.....

**Why I want to study INSAT?**

\-Based on laa3d eli 9raw INSAT w s2lthom 9alou its just 2 yrs of hard work mbaad it will be easier w testeness b rythme w kol chay. So natla3 reb7 TIME and MONEY.

\-Genesis :

* My old Mechanical Keyboard from Genisis has really really bad red switches, and its leds died within one year of usage. I was lazy to go for the warranty since it'll surely happen again anytime soon. I assumed here that the product itself is just bad, not the stock.

\-Redragon :

* My new Mechanical Keyboard hasn't made a year, and here are my issues with it:

A button no longer illuminates correctly, and two switches randomly stop working. Yesterday I went for the warranty (Tunisianet) and they said that it's not guaranteed that I'll get a new one and they sent my keyboard to the manufacturer apparantly.

This is not due to it not being cleaned or anything, I have cleaned it thoroughly and I don't use it that much since I had BAC this year and the only time I got to use it was during this ""Summer"" for a little gaming. 

Funny thing, I told the guy working there that the Z and Q button aren't working, he wrote Z and D aren't working, I only found this out when I arrived home since I was driving and didn't pay that much attention to the paper. Not only that but he also wrote that the whole keyboard no longer illuminates correctly...

* A friend has a Headset and barely 6 months in, the cable no longer works...
* Another friend bought a mechanical keyboard from them and the keyboard has broken plastic bits when he first bought it.

\-Konix:

* I had a headset from Konix and the first day the vibration stopped working on one side. I went in for a warranty and they replaced it with another one that does a broken sound when it vibrates, I honestly gave up at that point since I was little and I was scared that my parents would kill me.

&amp;#x200B;

Are these just coincidences or is it true? I'm more concerned about Redragon because the others could just be bad companies, but Redragon is popular worldwide and even Linus Tech Tips makes reviews of them...

On the bright side:

\-Logitech:

* I have had a G Pro that only started being uncomfortable (double clicking issues and adhesive pads) after 3 years. Yes 3 Years. And I gave it to someone that is currently playing with it. I fixed the double clicking issue.
* I currently have a G503 HERO mouse and I'm happy with the quality. It is 6 months old and nothing to say but perfect.
* I also have a 720p Logitech camera and nothing is wrong with it.
* I own a Logitech G Pro X headset and it feels like heaven and it is 4 months old. No. Issues.

Why can't I just buy a budget item without having to worry that 3 months later it'll start having issues? Is this normal?",,,,,,2021-07-13 12:46:21

However, while looking for other Tunisian podcasts I couldn't find anything! No groups, no ""fandom"" and even the ones I stumbled on on Google are in French. 
The main problem is: I planned on making this podcast in  Tunisian so I can't simply promote it on general podcast pages or anything.

So is there a way to confirm podcasts aren't a thing in Tunisia? Or am I missing something and giving up too soon?

PS: by ""market"" I am not really looking for ways to get monetized or anything. I was just wondering if Tunisan youth, or Tunisians in general even listen to podcasts.",,,,,,2021-07-15 00:30:05

The thing that I am concerned about is the following. I have a heart issue caused by covid in january of this year, because of that I cannot get vaccinated until September. Now, I've booked a travel to Tunisia about a month ago, before things started to peak or before those news reached Europe at least, and since I noticed those news, it was too late to ask to get my money back, and the travel is not a cheap one by  standards in my country (about 800€ or 1000USD approx). Because of that, I wouldn't give up this vacation, but I wanted to ask you people - do you think that situation in resorts is a bit safer than outside them, do you think that I would still be able to see a bit of Sousse (where I am staying) without exposing myself to covid too much on streets perhaps without entering shops, bars, etc?
Once again, good luck with the covid guys, and if you caught it - please rest, I haven't done it and I've had serious heart issues because of it. All the best, cheers!",,,,,,2021-07-15 05:53:07

1): The problem is I only have the funding of 6 months of continuing to C1 level+1 year at university in Germany and I know that I can work a part-time job there which will help me (I don't know if it's enough to cover my studying in the 2,3... years) if it is enough with the help of my family I think that is the way to go.

=&gt;YOUR ADVISE IN THIS CHOICE: Please,give me a Plan B for choice (1) if I decided to study at Germany and somehow everything went wrong and I returned here,how can I save my studying career at TUNISIA because INSAT will not accept me then (should I choose to study at a classic prepa then if I return to normal)

2): On the other side, I can study at INSAT and work hard into graduating as an engineer.

=&gt;YOUR ADVISE IN THIS CHOICE: Please,give me a Plan B for choice (2) on how to find opportunities on working in Germany or any english speaking country because I hate french.

3):The solution that I'm thinking of is to study INSAT+german B1-&gt;C1,which will get me to a more easier decesion to make by deleting some factors such as the exposure to the life in university ,taking care of myself,having a high studying rythme,basiclly things that I want worry about that much than If I went with choice A and I will only worry about studying (in germany).

=&gt;YOUR ADVISE IN THIS CHOICE: Please,give me a Plan B for choice (3) on whether is this possible and what I'm missing.

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion:I will be thankfull to anyone that is willing to take of his time and genuinely help me in this decision and feel free to provide any additional advises and informations whether on the studying system in tunisia or germany &lt;3 &lt;3",,,,,,2021-07-15 21:26:34

I am familiar with donkeys as burden animals but would like to buy a camel.
I apologize if this question might be funny or even offensive to some, but it is a genuine question and I think it might be easier to find ones for sale than for say long term rent.
After my travel will be over it will be difficult to leave the animal that helped so much but I guess I could find somebody to sell it to.

Any suggestions are welcome

The problem is that it's only two days thing and there's only one center in every governorate that will give shots so i expect it to be crowded af, which can increase the risk of me getting infected. I also have concerns for Sinopharm. Is there any data about it's efficiency against the Delta variant when it comes to hospitalization and death  ? The vaccine is also not recognized by the EU, i'm not planning to travel anytime soon but who knows.

I'm solely interested in the domain of IT with future immersion in the world of AI and Data Science, and with the opportunity of moving abroad.

**INSAT**

Surely one of the best universities in Tunisia, high post-graduation epmloyement rate, a big variety of clubs, good infrastructure and not the location is not so far away from home. However, is the education in the GL (Génie Logiciel) section that good? Aren't the programs obsolete and outdated? Does it give you the necessary skills that a modern IT engineer should have? Does it train you to become a world-class IT engineer?

**MEDTECH** 

I got recommended to enroll into this private university by my friend, that has enrolled it since two years ago. The program is fully taught in english, the university has international partners (University of Waterloo, University of Michingan Dearborn), has a better IT programm than ESPRIT (according to my friends) and has students from my original lycée (Lycee Pilote de l'Ariana), and **I have the opportunity to get a scholarship (up to 100%).** For now, it's my second choice if I won't be accepted into INSAT, but I wanted to know if I should place it in the first spot? Is private education in Tunisia recognized abroad? Isn't it obsolete or/and not relevant? Wouldn't the courses lack competition between student due to the univesity being private and therefore the education be less effective? 

**RUSSIA**

I got a partially funded scholarship by the Russian embassy (Payed tuition fees and 50$ stipend per month) to study in Peter the Great St.Petersburg Polytechnic University in one of the engineering programes (supposedly a prepa-info-like program), with a one-year language-integration course beforehand. I'm considering this choice as it is free, cheap, a good opportunity to get abroad and mainly because **Russian is my second mother tongue**. The circle of people studying with me would be people that had previously participated and won olympiades, highly integrated into the world of IT. I'd just want to know from the people that have experience in the international IT segment, if Russian University degrees have recognition among international IT companies? I'm considering this choice mainly because of the circle that I would be encountering during my studies.

Thank you for your help, I'm really currently torn between these choices and don't know which one to chose. I'd like to hear different points of views from people that can tell me more about the choices that I'm presented with.",,,,,,2021-07-21 10:07:17

July 2021

location: ER at the Regional Hospital of Ben Arous

I am the resident doctor on duty in the emergency unit of covid

My colleague, Dr. Issa Daraji, doctor on duty at the SMUR ben arous

At 15:00, the ambulance brought a patient that died while transporting her

The patient was directly admitted (this means we never saw her, we did not exam her , we do not know her, we do not know her family (because we serve in the Covid unit,)

The family enters the ER in a state of hysteria and they start breaking the glass (behind which there sick patients)

Meanwhile I was asked to deliver information about a patient to my colleague who they couldn’t get in contact with. While exiting the Covid unit, I was attacked verbally and physically by a family member of the deceased’s (again at that moment I didn’t even know who she is) because he saw a doctor and for him all doctors are bad and murderers. I’m not going to talk about the damage I suffered from, the video shows everything.

After that the attacker preceded (while trying to escape ) to run over my colleague dr darji .

This time no one died but next time what’s going to happen

Our field of study can offer countless opportunities, yet people throw them away by ignoring new technologies and stick to what materials the ""teachers"" provide. So I thought with a couple of friends, what if we guided groups of people through different paths ( Web dev, game dev..) and help them secure internships and hopefully jobs using our network of startups and other developers. Of course, our main focus will be making those trainees market-ready.Do you think they will be willing to join providing that we have experience in teaching and we already taught 12 people in the last couple of months, 4 of them secured internships for this summer?

I am currently using linux (gentoo to be exact) and I am interested to see how big the linux community is here. if you currently use linux, used it but you didnt like it so you switched back to windows, feel free to comment below about your experience.

here is how the journey went for me :

1. installed kali linux on a family shared computer with my father (2018) while still having windows on my person computer
2. dual booting ubuntu and windows for the first time (2020)
3. dual booting arch linux and windows using kde, had to reinstall it for about 3 times cuz its the first time (2020)
4. removing the windows partition and going full linux (2021)
5. switching to gentoo ! (yesterday) 

if you are using linux and want to chat and go deeper into stuff, you can hit me up on discord :) `Davros#6101`",,,,,,2021-07-24 20:18:30

However, I think it's a necessary one in light of what has been happening all over the country over the few last months that's why I believe we needed a move of this magnitude if we were to have any hope of changing for the better. Moreover, his decision to remove the protection over the filth that we have in our parliament and to take over النيابة العمومية  can be a useful one to punish some people that absolutely deserve it.

  
However, there are some points that we need clarified :

\*Kais is not a savior nor is he a prophet so stop treating him like one. He did make a bold move that I believe is powerful but he is just an ordinary man and giving him that much power might not be the best choice.  


\*This move can easily get out of control under a million possible scenarios: the situation is pretty complicated and the outcome is unpredictable. This is no time to be celebrating. Actually, this is the most difficult part and the one that is going to decide if this move was the right move or not. We must be civil and try our best to control the damage and protect the country instead of encouraging this kind of chaos.  


\*I believe this is the most important point: we are still in a sanitary crisis and we're more under the threat of covid than we ever were. The chaos that we have all seen yesterday is basically adding fuel to the flames and it cannot continue without our country suffering huge losses. 

So please consider this before doing anything that might worsen the difficult situation we're already in.",,,,,,2021-07-26 16:21:46

What happened yesterday wasn't violent nor illegal, and honestly it wasn't sudden either, people have been calling for it to happen ever since yesterday's morning.

Is Said a dictator ? Dictator "" a ruler with total power over a country, typically one who has obtained control by force.""

Does Said have total power over the country ? Did he gain anything through violence ? His powers are very in line with his constitutional powers and he has the right to use those powers as he won the consent of the governed in the latest presidential elections.

Said exercised his legal presidential powers as outlined by the constitution in response to popular calls to do that, this is how a Democratic Republic works.",,,,,,2021-07-26 18:00:30

Not a long time ago, I have discovered that my girl friend was being sexually harassed in the past.

The guy who was harassing her is ""Amine Mzoughi"", as far as I've seen, he plays a role in the SPL team (Which is a known gaming team) meaning this guy seems to have a nice career. Back then when this guy was harassing her, My girlfriend was 16 years old while he was around 28-ish. Now of course this guy has been blocked on Messenger, but a week ago he added her on Facebook, I told her to ignore and just block him, then, Today, he went to Instagram and sent her a friend request.

Not only that, but this guy reached out to other girls apparently, (afaik 3 girls including my gf). I will include screenshots from both point of views (of each girl).

&amp;#x200B;

* Now, you may ask, What kind of Harassments are these? Are we getting screenshots? ***I'm glad you asked because what you are about to see is completely disgusting. What you are about to see contain words such as ""ra\*e"", ""ra\*ek""...***
* The screenshots are not ordered, sorry for that!

# [Additional Screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/hjvaeMG) (3 Other girls)

I made this post to raise awareness that this guy is sexually harassing many girls. I didn't make this post to raise awareness about whether the girls should have blocked the guy or not. Thanks for understanding.",,,,,,2021-07-26 19:50:04

This was until 1980 when democratic elections finally took place. The issue was the economy continued to deteriorate and a high level of political instability and corruption continued to plague the country (that on addition to terrorism and an insurgency by the Shining Path)

Here we meet Alberto Fujimori, an outsider from the political scene. He was a random agricultural engineer who taught in university but became famous after appearing on a TV show named ""Concertando"" on the Peruvian national TV. Fujimori then chose to run for election with practically no election program but he capitalized on his opponent's reputation as an American aligned businessman and he was able to reach the second round and won in a landslide.

Over a year later, the situation wasn't any better, but most of the blame was put on the Congress and Parliament leading to protests against them. Fujimori thus took upon this opportunity and launched a de-facto coup. He claimed it was necessary to ""break with the deeply entrenched special interests that were hindering him from rescuing Peru from the chaotic state"". This coup was notable for initially having a lot of popular support and people that night went to the streets to celebrate it.

Fujimori became gradually a dictator (in fact one of the worst in Peruvian history) and he is currently in prison for his countless crimes and corruption. The degree to which his rise parallels Kais Said's almost perfectly is worrying me a lot.",,,,,,2021-07-27 13:51:32

So let's say you voted for someone, whom for the Election campaign promised and said so much, and once elected nothing of his promises has been fulfilled .

Do you then keep up with the wrong doings of his or do you do something about it?

i'm so fed-up with those people from all around  arab-countrys whom clearly are uneducated about the whole situation in Tunisia :

1- KS is a law professor in one of the most prestige Universities. So he knows exactly what he's doing. You can find a video of him talking about the allegations against him where he explained the legitimacy of his actions from a legal perspective :) .

2- you need to read the 80th law of the tunisian constitution first than you can make a take about what happened.

3- before KS decisions the country was on the verge of a civil war, i'm sure you'll find a lot of articles/videos for more insight on the matter. He basically saved the country from a national disaster.....

4- The people needed a radical change because the guys that got elected never did what they promised during their campaign and that for a long 10 years.

5- KS knows exactly that there is no place for a new dictator ( look at what happened to the last one, the people are not dumb to let that happen again ;) ), therefore he never tried to be one, he just listened to his people and tried to do something about the chaotic situation.

-How is the COVID situation there (Nabeul/Tunis)? I couldn't find enough data for specific city (Im vaxxed)

-Is it possible to communicate in English? I heard that people speak mostly french

ov7r96,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/ov7r96/land_robbers_are_about_to_rob_us_our_land/,17,Land robbers are about to rob us our land,"Hi guys, my family is currently living a dilemma and I seek you for answers as to possible solutions for this problem.

So, my parents bought a piece of land a 2 years ago. It's a 500m² piece of land in a particular town within a particular governorate, it costed them about 40 thousand dinars.

This piece of land as well as all pieces of land on the same side of the street has about 15 meters of state-owned land in front of it that everyone is waiting for it to be sold. Meaning that we have about a 500m² of state land between us and the main road.

My parents bought it thinking that they'll be the beneficiaries of this piece of land, that eventually it'll be theirs, or at least it'll still be state property and there won't be anything between us and the road, especially considering the cost is about 80 dinars for the square meter (an astronomical price when compared to the location, and now that we now how evil the neighbors are, even when compared to the neighbors).

Now, let me explain as well who the neighbors mostly are, they are people who got their lands there as compensation for a dam construction  that filled their lands with water (ancestral lands that are of their grandfathers and fathers, mostly poor mountain dwellers who got this much better land as a free meal).

My father is from the same family, but he's been away from from them since most of his childhood and adulthood, and his father's land wasn't compensated because it was on high ground, he's also one of the highly educated folks from that same family (a retired man who graduated university and has a respectable job).

Now here's the dilemma, it seems like everyone (8 family heads so far) there envies my father, they all want to ruin his purchased land, everyone wants to steal the land in front of us and make gardens/garages/roads... in front of our land!! Yesterday my father called a tractor to make some pits in the state land so that no one would trespass it and so that our limits are clear, and so that our clear access to the street won't be blocked, but someone whose house is like literally a kilometer away came out of his house running and started throwing himself in front of the tractor to stop us!! He started saying a lot of bad words to my father (mel hzem w ahbet) with absolutely zero respect claiming that he's been targeting that land (the land in front of our own bought land) so that he can build his own garages (in front of our own fucking will be house!!). He also took a wooden stick and threatened to hit my father repeatedly (this same man actually killed his own cousin 15 years ago and got out of prison during the last couple of years)

Today, my father went to the police station to complain, and also because he was afraid for his own life, but guess what, 8 families came all to protect this one man, and each of them claiming the land is his by right, one saying he'll make a garden there, another for roads, another to build a house... When my father asked how the F\*\*\* is he supposed to get to the street, they sarcastically told him to fucking make a rocket and fly there!! The police said that they can't interfere, and that they must find a solution between themselves. About 15 minutes ago, someone called my father telling him that these 8 individuals brought a tractor to the land to undo what we did there, and to make their own land borders!!

I am begging you, this is so fucking hard of a problem on our family, we don't even live in this same governorate, so we can't really be here all the time just to watch over this land from these black-hearted envious jealous people. We came here literally to have fun, to swim, to have a nice time and not to have fight all day long and have people like this doing this to us! 

Please, any type suggestions or help will be highly appreciated, even praying for us to be set free from these dark souled individuals will be highly appreciated. Please, and thank you.",,,,,,2021-07-31 14:06:40

-أنّ الإعلام وهو السّلطة الرّابعة قد أصبح في جلّه تحت سلطة النّهضة وحلفائها ما عدا قلّة من الإعلاميّين المتمسّكين بشرف المهنة.
-أن مجال الثقافة، أساس التقدّم الفكري والحضاري للشعوب، قد وقع تهميشه بشكل مُفزع لدرجة أن رئيس الحكومة السّابق اعتبر، في تصريح رسمي، أن الثقافة لا تعدو أن تكون مجرّد تسلية يمكن الاستغناء عنها.
- أنّ الفساد ونهب المال العامّ قد استشرى في أغلب مفاصل المنظومة السّياسيّة الّتي أصبحت قائمة على حسابات التّموقع السّياسيّ، وعلى خدمة مصالح الأحزاب وخدمة لوبيات متنفّذة دون أيّ اكتراث بمصلحة الشّعب والوطن. وهذا ما جعل دواليب سير الدّولة تتعطّل وتتفكّك.
- أنّ بعض المنظومة القضائيّة قد تمّ اختراقها، فأصبحت في خدمة الإرهاب تخفي ملفّاته وتحمي مموّليه وداعميه. إضافة إلى حماية الفاسدين والتّستّر عليهم.
-أنّ مجلس النّوّاب لم يعد يقوم بوظيفته التّشريعيّة، وإنّما قد أصبح ساحة لمهاترات وصراعات وعنف متبادل لا سيّما ضدّ النّساء. كما أن تسييره كان يخدم مصلحة رئيس المجلس تنفيذا لأجندا حزبه، حركة النهضة، بدلا عن خدمة مصلحة الشعب.
-أنّ الشّعب التّونسيّ الّذي أصبح يعاني معاناة كبيرة من جرّاء تردّي جميع الأوضاع الاجتماعيّة والاقتصاديّة يطالب منذ مدّة بتغيير عميق في إدارة الشّأن العامّ. وقد خرج يوم 25 جويلية معبّرا عن غضبه من الطّبقة السّياسيّة وموجّها احتقانه إلى حركة النّهضة وحزامها السّياسيّ بصفتهم السّبب المباشر في هذا الانهيار الشّامل.
-أنّنا ندعم استجابة الرّئيس قيس سعيّد لمطالب الشّعب التّونسيّ ولا نعدّ ذلك انقلابا على الدّستور ولا على الشّرعيّة. وإنّنا ندعو الرّئيس إلى محاسبة كلّ من مرق عن القانون محاسبة قانونيّة دون أيّ تشفّ ولا انتقام. كما ندعو الدّول الصديقة إلى مساندة اختيارات الشّعب التّونسيّ الّتي تضمن له الكرامة والعزّة والحرّيّة.
-أنّنا نسجّل بكلّ ارتياح أنّ مبادرة رئيس الجمهوريّة قد بدأت في أيّام قليلة في حلحلة ملفّات الإرهاب والفساد الّتي ترقد في الأدراج منذ سنوات طوال.
-أنّنا نرفض رفضا باتّا أيّ حوار مع المارقين عن القانون ونرفض أيّ تسوية مع الفاسدين أو أيّ عودة لهم إلى صدارة المشهد السّياسيّ.
-أنّنا متيقّظون إزاء أيّ إمكانيّة لعودة الاستبداد أو استئثار جهة واحدة بالسّلطات. ونحن حريصون على الانتقال الدّيمقراطيّ وعلى الحفاظ على مدنيّة الدّولة والحرّيات العامّة والمساواة بين المواطنات والمواطنين.
-أننا نطلب من كافة الدول الأجنبية عدم التدخّل في الشؤون الداخلية التونسية، وخاصّة عدم محاولات فرض مواصلة هيمنة الإسلام السياسي على المجتمع التونسي بعد أن قاسى منه الويلات طيلة العشرية
 الماضية.

- Laws and governments were formed/passed after shady under the table deals between Nahdha, Nidaa &amp; Co and the corrupt businessmen. No transparency or accountability.

- The political parties/MPs pass laws that protect them, ignore requests to lift ""immunity"" and were already untouchable with no checks and balances (which is not the case of a democracy)

- Before every election, each party would attract people on matters like religion, regionalism or ideology (the real agenda remains in the shadows)

- The electoral system was designed to make it really hard for someone to win a majority and do any reform

- Freedom of expression was already in danger (law suits against people who criticized Beji or religion)

- The system does not allow for any long term economical reform (something that we really need): 8 governments/cabinets in 10 years

- Corruption was normalized, politicians wanted to get appointed to public offices to steal our tax money. They came up with lame excuses to justify pointless cabinet reshuffles or appointments that were only staged high level thefts.

To be realistic, we have a system that looks like Iraq's or Lebanon's political system, it has elections, but apart from that, it is very corrupt, complicated and isn't worthy of the word democracy.",,,,,,2021-08-01 00:12:20

It has become obvious that the Tunisian interpretation of democracy includes the notion of a democratic economy. A lot of people are limiting democracy to the ballots exercise. This is not a foreign concept in Western democracies as there is economic freedom and transparency of information prevail. 

I believe this is where the successive parliaments and governments have failed. And there is a lot that they could have done. One can simply look at the thriving economies of East and West Africa who are now making giant steps in digitising their economies and opening a whole new world of information economy.

Now back to Tunisia, what's next for us? What is tunisia's president ""illi min kawkeb akher"" going to do?""

I have been asking myself a lot of questions without any clear answer:

1) Is he really going to change the electoral system? Some say he is going to set another jamahiria? Would that even work? If so how? Or is he going to make his own party? Or maybe he will let political activity resume with the same types of elections?

2) Is the country going to default its loans? And when the time comes who is going to fund to tunisia? And for what? What will they get in exchange? Assests or political alliance? 

3) what is he going to do about the economy? Is he shrinking the public sector expenses? Is he going ahead with IMF type of reforms? Or is he going to try to control the economy through a guided and probably failing monetary strategy? Is he going to liberalise it let the market regulate itself, abolish licensing in many sectors and stop government from dictating carrot and potatoe prices every morning? Is he going to democratise finance, allow digital banks and digital currency to rise? 

4) what is he doing about justice? What is he going to do in terms of legislation? And what is going to ensure there's a properly functioning system? What is going to happen with transitional justice? Or is that part of the past?

There are hints of what may happen but it is quite unclear. One thing is certain, also KS has to be pressured and held accountable like everyone else.",,,,,,2021-08-01 11:07:10

Reading through social media the last few years, I've been made aware of a serious growing problem that's been plaguing Tunisia of late, especially young Tunisians, and especially on Reddit.

Loss of personality, quick and easy influence, and inability to come up with one's own ideas and conclusions.

The need to fit in with the West has blinded many. When the streets rang with celebratory cheers after the president's decision, some young Tunisians stayed inside, lurking on their social medias, waiting for what the westerner has to say about this; what the westerner has to say about any and everything really. Is my opinion western enough? Will it give me a bad look when read by a Westerner?  Hmm, I wanna go out and cheer, but what if that's not very western? Oh, how tunisian of me, this is thoughtcrime!

These people can't shape opinions of their own. The westerner calls it a coup, then a coup I shall name it too! James Corbyn called it a breach of democracy? Yes, Corbyn is from the West, right? It is, by law of nature, a breach of demcoracy then. Some Western journo ( yes, the epitome of credibility), hyerbolically and exaggeratingly claimed was attacked by Kais Said, then hell yeah that happened, lemme bite into this corporate money-grabber bait hook line and sinker.

Why? What's there to gain? Is it Social Darwinism? What do you think running to the West for advice will do to you? Do you think it bodes well for our national identity? Do you really think an American's opinion is immediately better than yours? Ah yes, much better to go by those paragons of virtue's opinions than my own *checks notes* America. How credible do you honestly think American journalism is? How knowlegeable do you think Americans are to simple worldly whereabouts? Do you think blindly following a western mouth piece will improve your chances at immigrating? I live in France and have yet to suck a single Western cock. You can do it too!

Don't get me wrong, I highly treasure Western values, and think they're far superior than any other. I especially treasure American constitutional, and democratic values, and regard them highly, but let's not get too attached to the myth that Tunisia can somehow, and by some miracle, change into America or France. Clinging to modern western values and forcing them on Tunisia simply doesn't work.

Now, for the sake of argument, let's compare America to Tunisia. Does America have it within its constitution the possibility to freeze congress and senate? Does America have a leading party that's siphoning its population dry of their wealth? Is that party slowly but surely rending the country asunder? Has America only been a democracy for 10 years? Does American mentality slightly even compare to Tunisian mentality? Is America a third world country struggling with almost every social issue your mind can think of? The West and Tunisia are very different. Just because a Westerner gave a western opinion about a place they couldn't place on a map, doesn't mean you have to hold it as God's truth and preach it wherever you go.

If you want for Tunisia to be like America, or at least as close as it can get, in future generations, far far away from our own, you should probably start by targetting issues that are unique to Tunisa, and that no one other than Tunisians can understand.

So instead of looking westward for validation whenever a slightly major (or incredibly minor) event takes place in Tunisia, why not take a moment and, for the first time in 10 years, come up to your own conclusion? Trust me, when Gannouchi and Makhlouf are rotting in a cold prison cell, and the wealth of politicians is rightly distributed among the populace, and parliament is back in 2 weeks, you're gonna feel so good for not blindly following a random opinion you saw on Twitter.

I left my job last april in Tunisia (wanted to have a mental break berween 2 jobs) and still waiting for my papers to get ready to work abroad but due to covid lots of delay in long term visa.
In this period, I worked as freelancer via upwork but not that often (half time contract)
My question now: can I use my previous work certificate that says I was working 4 years until 30 apri 2021l? Same for Cnss history ? Or I can mention that I worked as freelancer and show papers getting paied via upwork in $ to apply for the short term visa as I'm invited to a conference in France but my long term visa is taking a lot of time :(

Tunisia appears poised for a prolonged political crisis as a combination of domestic and foreign support enables President Kais Saied to make further disruptive moves as he sees fit. Tunisian politics are in disarray and they’re unlikely to quickly return to the status quo after Saied’s controversial 30-day suspension of parliament ends.

These extraordinary measures are supposed to last for 30 days. No-one knows yet whether he will extend the emergency powers, or if he will embark on something else.

For Tunisia watchers the development came as no surprise. The poster child of the ""Arab Spring"" has long been moving inexorably towards the precipice.",,,,,,2021-08-05 11:07:59

But I am not sure I understand it a 100%. Here is what I understood:  


1. As a Tunisian, whether resident in Tunisia or not, can freely open a Tunisian bank account in Convertible Dinar (CD) or Foreign Currency (FC)
2. I can put money in the account directly but I have to give away 10% (contribution liberatoire)
3. I can receive money from a person abroad to the account directly but I have to give away 10% (contribution liberatoire)
4. If I work with a foreign company I can receive salary to my account directly **without** giving away 10% (contribution liberatoire)
5. I **cannot** freely, send money from this account to a foreign account. I might require authorization from the central bank.
6. I can however use this account to buy stuff online or use it while travelling **(not sure about this part)**

Thanks everybody for the replies! I have decided to postpone the trip because ofcourse the mandatory quarantine and also other factors that make the trip more stressfull and less enjoyable. 
In general and regarding corona i try to adhere to rules and regulations, even when its not enforced or only stated as advice. I respect the restrictions for travelleres because i believe this will bring an increase risk of infection and maybe even mutation? 

My Tunisian boyfriend needs to go to Tunisia and would like me to join in september (i'm from the Netherlands). We are going by car and i take a flight back. We can either stay with his family or book a hotel. I'm fully vaccinated and i understand i need to take the PCR test and register in the E7mi app.

My problem is ofcourse a mandatory 7 day quarantaine even when im vaccinated since i wont be staying more than a week or two. 
I want to be able to meet his (extended)family and see (some of) his country since this is my first time for both. I have to decide now if the trip is worth the hassle, coronastress and money cause i can postpone the trip. 

So is the quarantine still mandatory if you are vaccinated? If so how does the quarantine work if you want to visit family?",,,,,,2021-08-08 12:08:25

I am moving to Tunisia with my fiance soon (who is a Tunisian citizen), and we will be getting married. I am looking for work in public health, as I am a trained public health professional with a Masters. However, I want to make sure I am fulfilling all the requirements for working!

I read that I need to get a resident permit mentioning 'autorisé à exercer un travail salarié en Tunisie.' How do I obtain this, and can I get it easier once I am married to my fiance? Is it easy to get once I get a job?

Any advice for me in looking for a job in this field, as an expat?

The problem that I encountered were these:

\---------------------

* Tunisianet:

\&gt;False-Advertising: On their website, they advertise their Ryzen 7 5800X As the normal version ,not TRAY. I wouldn't call this False-Advertising 100%, but technically I'm missing a box.

\&gt;Long and unorganized queue: You just enter there and the place is just full like a hospital and sometimes they accidentally skip a person (by double clicking the ""next"" button)

\---------------------

* Scoop:

\&gt;GPU Being mined with? : I wanted to buy a GPU that they list on their ""El Configurateur"", but when I reached out to them they told me they can only sell them with a configurated computer and they got another list for GPUs they can sell separately, which got me thinking that they are actually using these cards before putting them in these configurated computers.

\&gt;Service is kind of bad: Their workers via phone tell me to do (X) then when I go to the main building of scoop in Centre Urbain Nord they tell me to do (Y).

\---------------------

* Zoom:

\&gt;Website Outdated.

\&gt;For fucks sake, can't they say that the parts they sell can only be put in a pc that they make?

\&gt;I honestly never bought from them because I never got the chance to buy from them due to their outdated site.

\---------------------

* MegaPc:

\&gt;Website Outdated.

\&gt;I have no complaints other than that, but their service is kind of annoying, the woman is literally treating me as if I know nothing about computers and suggesting me stupid parts.

\&gt;And yeah one more thing, I don't know whether this was a coincidence or not, but the woman suggested me to buy their Gigabyte PSU which currently has [Explosion Issues](https://soyacincau.com/2021/08/09/psa-these-gigabyte-power-supplies-might-explode-without-warning/).

\---------------------

* Sbsinformatique:

\&gt;Website Outdated(Jesus, everything is out of stock).

\&gt;The guys who work there feel like they have no idea what they have in stock, even they, are outdated.

\&gt;They have a history with Mining GPUs before selling them.

\---------------------

* Skymil' Informatique:

\&gt;Website Outdated.

\&gt;Their location is really bad.

\---------------------

* Spacenet:

\&gt;Outdated Site / Misleading information: Some stuff have wrong prices.

\&gt;Terrible service: I once bought a mice from them, and they had this new kid working there, He had an earphone listening to music, taking his time and he keeps talking with his work mates non stop, not giving a single fuck about me and wasted almost 1 hour because he got the order wrong even tho It's in front of him because I printed the product. Funny thing is he kept explaining why he made an error.

\---------------------

* Mytek:

\&gt;Outdated site: I went there 5 times and got rejected 3 times due to stock not being available.

\---------------------

&amp;#x200B;

At this rate you may ask, why didn't I call them before? Well I do call them, but most of them don't answer or literally just tell me if it's available online then it is available.",,,,,,2021-08-13 15:10:25

No one is whinier than me about garbage IRL. I don't shut up about it. People littering drives me so crazy. But it would be quite silly to think it's a shitty individuals problem.  Some people are plain assholes, but they're pretty much the tiniest factor in the trash equation.

* We have a severe lack of trash cans. Sometimes you have to walk 20 mins to find one.

* We underfund and underhire in the public cleaning services due to forced austerity measures. The cleaners are stretched thin.

* We have a trash scavenging problem or more accurately a poverty problem. People are so desperately poor they tear trash bags open for plastic and leave it on the ground / damage the container by dropping it. Cats, dogs and the wind finish the job of spreading the content.

We know someone who literally has a PhD and has to scavenge trash because no job opportunities, sick wife and they often don't make enough to feed their kids.

Scavenging for recycling by itself is not a problem. In fact it's really great to have waste organized and recycled, especially for metals. The problem is the state won't organize this sector despite the know benefits of it. Hire them in dignified jobs, the streets will get cleaner.

* The state won't fucking ban one use plastic. It's cheaper for corporation to use plastic. Remember the cement company that switched from reinforced paper to plastic to make marginally higher profits? Knowing it'll result in millions more of plastic bag waste yearly? Yay capitalism.

* Most of plastic pollution literally comes from 3 companies who put millions into PR campaigns to reframe the crime onto the user when they switched from glass to disposable plastic. Like our recent cement example, plastic is just cheaper and so is externalising the cost of handling pollution they created for no reason to society. 

So I'll be real, whenever I see whining about trash, and it's directed at le lowly, horrible ignorant masses ew I cringe. It's the easiest example of corporations and state screwing everyone over but successfully blaming you for it.",,,,,,2021-08-21 20:16:11

Edit 1: You need to be at least 18 to be considered. Thank you.

Edit 3: You need to have an e-dinar card or a bank account.

Hi guys,

Anyone here is studying English (or graduated) ? 

I run a blog for one of my clients, and I'm looking to hire a student or graduate for a little-but-long-term job. 

The job is proofreading: You need to examine **text carefully and find, correct and even reconstruct typographical errors and mistakes in grammar, style, and spelling**.

Most of the time, it's short (500 word max), but sometimes 1500-2000 words.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be paying 50 TND for each job (whatever 200-500-1000 or 1500 word). The number of jobs varies, but generally twice a week.

&amp;#x200B;

You must be very fluent in English (American accent) and fast in terms of delivery time (at the same day if the number of words is less than 500).

Each time, i'll be paying before you release me the output.

&amp;#x200B;

PS: If you are wondering how many is 500 words, this text has 147 words.",,,,,,2021-08-22 10:00:02

It caught my attention that she didn't want to have friends who were homophobic. Before that there was another girl who was promoting for her feminist podcast and among other things I heard her saying in the few minutes I heard of her podcast was the word ""non-binary"". 

It is not rare that these people will still identify themselves as Muslims. Well, they are indeed Muslims but shouldn't a Muslim be the way hos God wants him to be? And I mean we all know what God told us about homosexuality and تغيير خلق الله and such stuff. So my question is how do these Tunisian young boys and girls? Isn't it against all logic to claim to be at the same time Mulsim but then stand for things which Islam very clearly prohibits?

We might for example have huge feelings of hate towards somebody we know nothing about except the words she writes on the Internet.

 If we take the word ""ena"" for example it is said in at least six way of which three end vertically and three end horizontally. For each vertical one there is an horizontal alternative. Ena (ex: Tunis) vs eni (Sahel) En'a (ex Gafsa) vs en'i (ex Gabes) and Nè (ex Sidi Bouzid) and Né (different regions). 

This is manifested through many other examples such as: I hit him (dhrabtou vs dhrabtah), his son (weldou vs weldah).

The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human being to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries.

Which I totally agree with because of my personal experience in the army but I want it to look up papers about this because I know that has been studies About why this phenomenon exsits but i just can't seem to find anything about it.

These studies answer questions like: 

why are low IQ people / poor / desperate more attracted to the army or the police force ? 

Why are they still hostile environment for women and homosexuals?

why such entities ( armed forces)amplify certain traits thus making the armed forces an exaggerated mirrored version of their society (worst?!) Traits? .

all these questions I've encountered studies about them before and I had the chance to talk with some Experts about them but I couldn't get more details or go deep into it.

so I wanted to ask you guys if you can help me find the answer.

Edit 1:

I'm not simply talking about education.

but to talk about education, the number of educated personnel in the army including engineers and officiers is far outnumbered by number of uneducated low-ranking personnel,so generalizing is not wrong ,but i would like to apologize if i did so.

What I'm eluding to is social value and traits , you'll find that sexism, misogyny, patriarchal ideals, leaning to authoritarianism, conservative values, religious intolerance, homophobia (ofc,expected since we are still talking an ""muslim"" country after all),power hungry, mental health denialism and a the classic idea of a ""man"" that's feed by so much exaggerated toxic and vicious cycle toxic masculinity...etc

These things exist in society, sure , but in the army they get AMPLIFIED to a maximum, and my question is why? That's it

Edit 2:( this is a comment i wanted highlight, thank u @sunbrosa )

The army and police force are by far the easiest jobs to get into with almost next to no qualifications aside from obedience, even though they're pretty much like slavery. That's especially Ture in developing countries.

So most ppl getting into those jobs are either ppl who couldn't get anywhere else and have no other choice or ppl who revere authority and power.

Now mix that with the kind of power and advantages they get just by being a law keeper or holding a gun, and the respect and fear citizens have towards them. You get narcissistic fascists with low IQ that know nothing but taking orders and giving them who were brainwashed into thinking that they have all the power and can do pretty much anything. Note that they're protected by the law and their fellow mates with almost no accountability.

This only applies to developing and communist countries, since in first world countries there's accountability and supervision and even then we see abuse of power.",,,,,,2021-09-04 12:02:25

2. The spread of the delta variant, is it now under control? I am now fully vaccinated.
3. What is the ideal time duration to spend in Tunisia?
4.Is UBER available in Tunisia or do I have to take the local taxi and if so do I need to agree on a price or is there a meter?  Are taxis readily available throughout the country?
5. Are all vendors supporting credit cards or do I need to carry cash with me everywhere?
6. Any recommendations on what places are a must go to and what to watch out for or avoid?

""We find that whole communities suddenly fix their minds upon one object, and go mad in its pursuit; that millions of people become simultaneously impressed with one delusion, and run after it, till their attention is caught by some new folly more captivating than the first."" 

The more diverse a society is the more likely its people are to accept different opinions and deal with them in a civilised way. The more homogeneous, and thereby often primitive, a society is the more chocked they will be by ideas which don't conform to the generally accepted culture of that society. In many cases they will go as far as accusing advocates of these ideas of being crazy. Or sometimes even kill them.

This statement – asking Tunisia to return to the constitutional norms in which Parliament has a prominent role – was signed by the ambassadors of Germany, the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Japan, and Canada.

° Most of what you know is very likely to be wrong and I am here to correct it 

° Democracy is a very corrupt system to govern a country and Tunisia should never aim to be a democratic country 

° The West has never been and will never be a good example to follow

I am an Arab living in North America from Iraqi origins (sunni). Due to some difficulties in Iraq we were essentially exiled and forced to immigrate, but thankfully managed to find success.

However, I have always wanted to return to the Arab world since I feel like a stranger where I am, and Tunisia seems like one of the best options (also considering Jordan) because of its stability (at least compared to other Arab countries), nice weather, etc.

I speak Arabic, English, and a little bit of French.

I have the option to live in tunisia for a few months next year, and possibly longer in the future if I like it. Is this a good idea? If I choose to stay long term is it possibly to be accepted in Tunisian society? Is it a good place to plant roots for the future?

pln4nn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/pln4nn/a_few_words_about_money_which_you_probably_only/,0,A few words about money (which you probably only will read here),"Money is one of the biggest problems for so many people. Yet it should never be. Money is a concept which was created and has been evolving throughout thousands of years but fiat money specifically has never been anything else than ""empty numbers"". A concept. Numbers that wealthy and powerful individuals inside wealthy and powerful nations decide how they should be divided amongst people. 

In order to change such a process which has been ongoing for a very long time a big revolution is needed and that will take time but for you as an individual here are some easy tips which will help you understand money better: 

1) Money is good as long as it is a means. Money is evil when it becomes a goal in itself. Btw, for 99%of the people it is a goal. 

2) Never talk about money. Make it instead. And be sure that if you belong to the 99% mentioned above you will never make enough money. 

3) Money in itself as I said is useless so if you don't have money control your cravings and wishes instead. Change yourself from within. Don't live and then make money for your living (that is how loans work for example) but instead make money first and then live by it. Never use money you don't already have.",,,,,,2021-09-10 15:19:52

It has to be their way of thinking and being if they want to live happy lives. It is not easy to become a free thinker but the reward is huge, once you succeed. And I chose a relatively ""extreme"" example so that people understand how important it is to think correctly and live well. 

The example is food. We need food to survive and most food needs to be cooked. How the food is cooked is never important. If it is on the latest and most sophisticated machine or on wood, it is literally and absolutely no difference. 

The only three things that should matter when preparing food: taste, healthiness and time of preparation. It is ok if you want to be ""a stressed unhappy modern human being"" where everything shall be too quick. Then, fine, be modern. But don't forget that choosing a humble lifestyle where quality is the most important thing is much more sustainable in the long run. 

Now, apply that to every single thing in your life and soon you will start seeing change.",,,,,,2021-09-11 13:29:49

For example, people who don't differentiate between their opinions and facts. 

You might love lgbt people as much as you want and you might support them as much as you want and you might feel very modern for that. All that is fine. But once you start including religion in your arguments then you immediately have to hear: SHUT UP! DON'T TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW! 

Do you even believe in God? If yes, do you care about what He said about this question? If yes, do you know which is the correct way to truly know what He truly said? If yes, are you willing to respect and listen to the thousands of Men who dedicated their lives and accepted to suffer so that you truly get His message as He exactly said it?  

Now, we all know that the answer to - at least the three last questions and in many cases all four- is no for most people, so think what you want and feel what you want but don't you ever include religion and insist on giving legitimacy to your opinions just because they are your opinions.",,,,,,2021-09-13 07:29:16

I am a 29 year old guy with 3 years of experience working in the IT Support field (at more than one company). I am fluent in English and French and i only have a bachelor's degree in computer science. 

I would like to know how/what to do in order to land a job abroad (my primary target is Europe but i am open for other countries). I've heard of a lot of people in my field who found jobs in France so it was my focus lately, especially since i've worked there for 2 weeks during a work mission with my former company, and i loved it there!

I also tried some ""SSII"" companies that help you find a contract in France but nothing came out of it.

Some people also recommended i get some certifications so i am planning to get an ITIL one and i hope that'll help boost my chances. 

I would appreciate any advice or pointers as to how to proceed and where to look etc.

Thank you in advance!",,,,,,2021-09-13 12:38:43

Personal coaches  making their clients adopt a stupid ass program with infinite amount of cardio and meal plans that are simply not enjoyable? i mean how is it hard to just take some time and listen to what your client like as food and try to find some healthy alternatives or even make small tweaks to his favorite dish so he can still have fun? why don't bother and listen to his favorite activities ( maybe walking or biking ) and try to make them a little bit more challenging instead of the suffering i see them endure every time in the gym? ( i get it exercise should be challenging but it should be also a progressive activity that is adapted to the trainee level.)

they keep posting pictures of  people losing 8 kg in 2 weeks as if it was something to be proud of ( but in reality that the majority of that weight loss is just water weight/glycogene depletion from the bs i talked about earlier)

The whole industry fails to illustrate that being healthy is a lifestyle not a  shore.

 People fail to understand that to lose weight it's all about calories in/calories out ( thermodynamics hello???), yet they keep emphasizing on the ''slata/escalope'' bs diet from the 50s.. ( am not saying micronutrients are not important, but just putting people on absurd meal plans won't solve the issue and your asking for eating disorders, YOYO dieting etc..)

The whole industry reflects how much we are uneducated about this matter.

it may sound like a very superficial matter, but really when you get to see the prevalence of people with metabolic syndrome/Diabetes/Hypertension in our country it's getting absurd.

No drug in the world, no doctor in the world could restore or help reduce the damage you do to your own healthy once you reach these stages.

The most powerful tool we have is sports/diet and it doesn't even need to be perfect at 100 %, just moderation and be good like 80 % of the time and you will get with it. no need '' bech tehrem rohik'' or follow an absurd diet ( AM TALKING TO YOU LOW CARB DIETS BS) just be smart, google your calories, and eat with moderation while trying to vary it as much as you can.

For weightlifting, never compare yourself to others, COMPARE YOURSELF WITH YOUR OWN SELF, it's great to have a model but don't be obssesed by the physique , lift for the enjoyment and hitting Prs , your physique WILL GET BETTER AS LONG AS YOUR CONSISTENT , enjoy the process.

prrtx9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/prrtx9/advice_needed_homesick_partner/,12,Advice needed - homesick partner,"Hi all,

I am posting as I could really use some advice. 

My partner and I both live in England. I have lived here my whole life and my partner was born here but was raised in Tunisia (which is where his Dad and paternal side of his family all live currently). We last visited in the summer of 2019 and have not been able to go back since due to COVID and UK travel restrictions. Unfortunately it isn’t looking good for us to be able to go back before the end of the year either. 

My partner regularly video calls with his Tunisian side of the family but it’s not the same and he has talked about feeling depressed as he misses his family and no longer enjoys living in the UK. His work contracts ends at the end of October and I have urged him to travel back to Tunisia but he doesn’t want to pay the quarantine costs which are £2000+. 

I am out of ideas on how to help him feel a little bit less homesick. I have been trying to cook traditional Tunisian meals with him and he has enjoyed that so far but I’m out of ideas.

Has anyone got any advice on how I could help him to feel less homesick? Any and all suggestions are more than welcome. I hate to see him feeling so down. 

Thank you in advance !!",,,,,,2021-09-20 10:11:42

You will understand that no matter whether you work at Apple in Dublin or at some mramma in Ga3four, people are th same. People mean problems. 

You will understand why Sartre said his famous ""L'enfers c'est les autres"". You will realise that it is childish to keep thinking that all others are idiots and that you are an angel whom they are treating bad. Well, unfortunately not everyone realises this but anyway. 

The correct way to deal with people is to know, think, remember and keep in mind always that it is not easy to have to do with people. That it is not meant to be easy. That it is a challenge. That it is an integral part of the thing called ""life"".",,,,,,2021-09-21 15:36:10

I was about to register for the Home Edition for next week but I saw the ID requirements, and I want to make sure I don't get screwed. Their refund/cancellation policy is notoriously terrible.

They require an ID with your name, photo and signature. Government ID, passport or driver's license. I only have my government ID but since it's only in Arabic, I don't think the proctor will be able to read it. It also doesn't have my signature on it. As far as I know, none of our IDs have our signatures. My passport expired about 2 months ago so that's not an option.

Their support wasn't helpful at all. ETS's Office of Integrity didn't respond to the two emails I sent.

I'm running out of time so any help will be very much appreciated.

Thank you!",,,,,,2021-09-25 10:09:45

The problem is that I have nothing to go off of in my search except for past experiences from my peers (people who were in the same position as me). And most past alumni have conducted their internships/research in France/Germany, etc.. More to the point, I genuinely don't know what the equivalent of a PFE is in the English speaking world.

pvpu3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/pvpu3i/dracowar_shilling_a_get_rich_quick_scheme_bs/,64,Dracowar shilling a get rich quick scheme BS Crypto course.,"So a friend of mine who comes from a poorer background sent me a link to this Dracowar video.  In it this guy (Draco) features this lady who is a self proclaimed crypto expert (as if you can be an expert in crypto) and millionaire! (I doubt it).  Towards the end of the video, they start shilling her Bullshit course to teach YOU how to become a crypto expert yourself and learn all the TECHNIQUES of investing.  She says it is a 5 level course, where you have to pay 1169 TND for the 1st level, and at the end of it, you can then choose to buy in to the next level. Also worth noting, there are no pre-requirements so any sucker can give her their money.  This is your typical get rich quick scheme, and follows the same format used by some of the biggest scam artists like: Grant Cardone / Dan Lok / ... To name a few.  The format goes as such:  

These grifters usually target people who are poorer and try to sell them a dream.  A dream in which getting rich is only a few steps away!  And all you have to do to get it, is to join my x level course program, where I, the expert can teach you all the in and outs you need to know on how to become rich.

These ""courses"", if you can even call them that, usually provide nothing of substance, and rely on sucking people into this system, where they can then upsell them the next level.  In the worst case scenarios, they might even turn into a Ponzi scheme.  


Now I personally do not watch Tunisian Youtube at all. I have however heard the name Dracowar before, and I can now see why.  The dude's got 200k subs, which is HUGE for Tunisia!  Towards the end of the video, he seems to strike some sort of deal with her, where the people who come from his channel can get this little bonus, which leads me to believe that he is getting some sort of kick back from this.  So fuck this guy!

In conclusion, I'm saddened.  I say this, as my friend who has no fucking money and no bac, has come to and told me he is interested in this shit and it just breaks my heart.  He thinks doing this is better than an actual formation at  **التكوين المهني** , which he has been planning to do for a while now.  The LITERAL title of this video has written on it ""she did not pass the bac, and she became a millionaire with Bitcoin"".  Like, you can't get scummier than that.  They're literally preying on the most vulnerable people (dropouts, kids, poorer people ...).  

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abTTscvb0K8&amp;ab\_channel=Dracowar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abTTscvb0K8&amp;ab_channel=Dracowar)

&amp;#x200B;

Just sad.  The actual way this lady will ever become a millionaire is by people giving her their hard earned money.  So please, think before giving these morons your money ...

Edit:  I have nothing against crypto itself.  I personally would not invest in it, as it is too volatile for me, but if you're a crypto fan/investor then good on ya!  Just do it at your own risk, and do not give these fucks your money!",,,,,,2021-09-26 08:28:52

Hi everyone, I'm a young man wanting to go to Tunisia this year to study Arabic (I want to learn the tunisian dialect mainly, but I am not opposed to learn some fosha as well) and live with my family.
I would be living with my aunt who doesn't speak French nor English, so I'll practice with her for sure but obviously I need some real courses for grammar etc... Ressources for the Tunisian dialect are pretty rare on the Internet (there is some, it's just pretty basic), so I want to ask if anyone has an affordable school to recommend in Tunis? Not like the 25000€/year American school.
Chokran jezilan wa 3aichek!

Bonjour à tous, je suis un jeune homme qui désire aller vivre en Tunisie cette année pour apprendre l'arabe et vivre avec ma famille. Je veux connaître le dialecte tunisien, même si ça ne me dérange pas d'apprendre un peu de fosha au passage.
Je vivrais avec ma tante, qui ne parle ni français ni anglais, donc je pourrai pratiquer avec elle, mais il me faut des vrais cours pour la grammaire etc..
Des recommandations pour une école accessible à Tunis et pas trop chère ? J'aurai un petit budget donc l'école américaine a 25 000€/an n'est pas une possibilité !

While trying to sugarcoat their Islamic brotherhood origins with the 'Islamic democracy' label, it never truly worked for Ennahdha or at least was too late to cover it up. Kais on the other hand is playing a 4D chess by playing the progressive game and appointing a women as prime minister, effectively distracting us from his authoritarian objectives. Let's be honest here, this was clearly a PR move. Why would a person that thinks that women should inherit less than men appoint a woman? 

The appointment of Najla Bouden Romdhane wasn't in good faith, it's purely a decoy to dupe the progressives so he can comfortably and secretly solidify his Islamist populist position. There's no reason to doubt it, he already showed his true intentions by reducing the prime minister's prerogatives and accrediting himself full control of the government, this is never a good thing. 

Najla is basically his puppet and she'll serve his agendas.

pyvqxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/pyvqxv/til_france_massacred_tunisian_civilians_during/,78,TIL - France massacred Tunisian civilians during the Algerian Independence war,"During the Algerian War for Independence, the French bombed the town of [Sakiet Sidi Youssef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakiet_Sidi_Youssef) in Tunisia, believing that FLN troops were hiding there. Indeed, Algerian freedom fighters regularly crossed the border and attacked French positions from inside Tunisia, shooting military planes out of the sky. Tunisia was at the time officially neutral, but supported their Algerian brothers nonetheless and allowed them in. The French wanted this to stop and decided to bomb Tunisians, both to crush their spirits, and to send a message that Algerian troops hiding in Tunisia will be targeted, and that Tunisia should expel them in order to avoid further bombings.

Thus, in February 8th of 1958, French planes illegally flew above Tunisian soil and flattened the town to ruble, leaving only devastation and death. Nothing was spared, even the school full of children attending their morning classes was targeted, and this bombing ended up costing the lives of more than 70 Tunisian civilians and Algerian refugees, and injured more than 148 others. As of today, the French never apologized for this crime, and no reparations nor recognitions were given. Following this grave event, international opinion shifted against France, and both Tunisia and Morocco went on to further support Algeria, taking a hard stance that continued throughout the war, up to the Algerian independence in 1962.

I find this event really interesting, since it was the last time that the Maghreb was united, albeit against a common foe. I honestly wish we continued to support each other since then, but politics is a cold game sadly, and the French purposefully tried to divide us (it ended up working in the end). Maybe in the future we'll get over our difference and start working together again :)

Anyways, I hope that was informative!

q051bg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/q051bg/so_how_can_i_enter_tunisia/,12,So (how) can I enter tunisia?,"Aslema! 

The Tunisian laws and regulations about entry to Tunisia are giving me an actual headache. I hope someone here can help me clear some things up about entry into Tunisia given the current state of rona. I am German which may be relevant for some things.

a) quarantine and vaccine. I have been vaccinated for the second time on the 30th of September with BioNTech. I don't want to visit Tunisa for 2 weeks just to spend 10 days of those 14 in quarantine. So, am I, in the eyes of the Tunisian authorities, vaccinated fully if I leave Germany on the 8th of October (1 week and a day after vaccine)?

b) entry with ID or Passport. I found on the auswertiges Amt the possibility to enter Tunisia without my Passport, if I am entering with a socalled ""Pauschalreise"". I have no idea what that means and the Internet is just confusing me more. If someone can shed some light on this mystery I'd be very happy, else I'd have to spend the extra money on an express passport (as I don't have one)

c) PCR tests: At arrival in the airport the PCR test must not be more than 72 hours old, right? That hasn't changed?

Is there anything else I need to know? Any more tips or dangers for someone entering Tunisa that may send me back to Germany for bureaucratic rona reasons?

Thanks a lot for the help!",,,,,,2021-10-02 22:36:07

Edit for those interested in the answer: 
Fibre optique seems to be the ultimate affordable solution. However getting it is a bit tricky. I have talked to my local globalnet seller and he told me that generally you can get it as long as you're with in 1km of the closest line which I think I am but I'll have to check on TT.

There are other solutions too but they are either not that good (vdsl) or expansive (4G internet, fly box etc).

At the end of the day you'll have to talk to TT or the internet provider you're going for because there's no ""yes or no"" kind of reply here since it all depends on where you live.",,,,,,2021-10-05 15:56:01

i recently launched a youtube channel around the popular science (vulgarisation scientifique) not in English, not in French but in Dardja because i think that there is alot of this kind of channels around the internet but not much in Dardja. I have met alot of people from Tunisia and we could understand each other without any problem, so i'm pretty sure that you guys here can watch and understand the videos i make,

I uploaded a video about the 5G today (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_ITGujoiS8) , so for this 5th video of the channel, I decided to try to share it as much as possible.

Feel free to give me any feedback, i'm starting this journey and hope that i'll make it some day,

I have a Lebanese friend who is currently in Lebanon but wants to come to Tunisia for tourism. What's the easiest way for him to get a visa? 

His Lebanese girlfriend applied to the embassy in Lebanon last year and it took them more than 2 months to give her a visa, and she only got 14 days. So he'd rather avoid that as he wants to spend a month in Tunisia and he wants to go there asap not in 2 months time.

What's your experience/advice guys? Is there an easy/straightforward way for him to come to Tunisia?",,,,,,2021-10-12 05:34:58

I knew about a lot of the historical facts but actually i had no idea about especially the ROMAN sites in tunisia, untill i visited 3 times the last 10 months due to my fiance being from tunisia. I knew about the carthage ruins, which are cool for someone especially interested like me and bardo museum is great too but for standard tourists i dont think they would care that much. However you have hidden gems. Everyone knows about the colosseum, rome is already an incredibly popular tourist destination and of course theres more to rome than colosseum, but the point is its a very popular destination. I study carthaginian and roman history and i had no idea el jem existed untill a year ago. I was lucky to visit december last year and it blew my mind. Its basically just a slightly smaller colosseum, a bit worse shape but even when i visited there was workers there doing renovation work, and yes i know i visited during corona but that place was EMPTY. like it was me, my fiancee, the workers and maybe 4-5 other people. Colosseum is completely full at all times, and i believe theres reasons for this. First of all of course rome is way more accesible, we reached el jem on a 2.5ish our drive from tunis, and the rest of el jem is nothing, like its just a town that has NOTHING in it except for the amphiteatre, while rome has so much more to offer than just the colosseum. I have been in hammamet and sousse and i have seen what kind of infrastructure and tourist friendly enviorements tunisians can create, but tunisia in my opinion is so much more than 5 star hotels and beaches? If you built some resturants, did some promoting, anything around your historical past you could attract so many tourists, at least thats my opinion. Tourists come to norway and scandinavia in general all the time due to our beautiful nature and our viking history, and we also promote that, of course due to the recent success of viking entertainment on tv everything has been more well known, but i really believe if tunisia made an effort they could profit hugely and also create a lot of jobs. Hire builders and make el jem tourist friendly with hotels and resturants, make it appealing to visit not just for history nerds, you have so much hidden potential there. But maybe thats just me",,,,,,2021-10-16 22:25:13

[Btw I'm Maltese, and I love how much I understand Tunisian. A research said that only 1/3 of our words are Arab, but that's because we had European colonisers for a long time and we took words from their languages. I always thought it was more because I would say 60-70% of our daily words are arab, and since they are our ""basic"" words we use them the most. In fact a lot of words of ours can be said in Arab or Italian, for example for ""answer"" we have tweġiba (Arab) or risposta (Italian).]",,,,,,2021-10-20 11:43:53

Moroccan here, abortion is legal in Tunisia since 1973. I find it impressive that you Tunisians, managed to do 50years ago what us Moroccans couldnt do even today.

When I was growing up, my mom (she's very much deranged) went to great lengths to convince me that the Tunisian outside world was full of nothing but dangers and perils. ""People will try to rob you, attack you, there are gangs, knife-wielding psychos... Don't take public transportation which is fraught with danger"" This has planted very deep fears into my psyche and I spent most of my teenagehood and childhood holed up in my room.

Eventually I studied abroad in the US for a couple of years, and in that place, I went out all the time by myself without fear of anything. Anyway I'm running into financial problems right now and have to live in Tunisia for idk how long, but when I went home I found all those fears from my childhood relating to Tunisia haven't really disappeared. Even nowadays my mom still spouts about outside dangers, it's very discouraging. I know it's mostly bullshit but it's really fucking with my brain.

So, I've come to ask you guys, can you give me an honest assessment of these so called dangers in Tunisia? It's kind of an embarrassing question to ask but I need a way to make my brain less fucked up.",,,,,,2021-10-20 15:47:51

So, I came across a few sources on the Internet, one of them an old comment in this sub, which say that in Tunisian, the word ""Souri/Syrian"" is not necessarily used to refer to someone whose nationality is Syrian but to different stuff. Like, they said in Tunisian ""Yetkalam besSouri"" is used to refer to someone who speaks French, that architectural styles that aren't traditional are referred to as Syrian in Tunisia and a few other things. So I came to you guys to verify whether this is really true.

Ideally if it's correct, I would love to hear from you guys about other contexts you use the word ""Souri"" in and what they mean.

Thank you so much in advance to everyone who will answer! If only you guys knew the amount of love I hold for Tunisia in my heart. I sincerely wish that Tunisia comes out of its current political uncertainty strong and all its problems get resolved. Much love to all of you guys from Damascus &lt;3",,,,,,2021-10-20 16:03:43

I’m actually considering moving to Tunisia for 6 months maybe. I decided after meeting some Tunisians who were super friendly and chill. 

The people I met give me good vibes ☀️ Not to mention the food! Tajin and fricassé thon! And of course the café au lait :) I also heard that Tunisian Food was quite diversified and healthy can you confirm?


But anyway so I’d like to move to either Tunis or Sousse. Also is there somewhere warm during the winter? Where do you think is the best to live as a foreigner? I’m from France btw. 

And how to find a studio or a tiny house wihout being scammed for let’s say 250€/month all included… Would it be possible? 

My only requirements are :

In a city or village not noisy calm and peaceful especially in the apartment. 

Strong &amp; reliable wifi.

Have good homemade and local foods.

The less alcohol and less parties the better!!

And lastly, is it doable to live on 800€/month in Tunisia? 

Sorry for all this questions, but I’m total beginner for Tunisia, and hope to connect with you locals from Tunisia!!

I've discovered a few Tunisian artists past few days and I'm wondering whether you can recommend artists(whether Tunisians or others) that make music with some similarity. I've already been a fan of Dhafer Youssef since my teens but my new discoveries are Ÿuma and Emel Mathlouthi.

So yesterday I posted here asking whether we have any map or list for Taxi Jame3i routes. And it seems that there aren't any.

After the suggestions of a fellow redditor, I decided to do some minimal effort and start this post to organize some sort of guide that would address this issue.

I will start with adding the routes I know. And I rely on your contributions, fellow redditors, to improve this list and update it as time goes by. If it proves to acutally be of any worth, I'd love for this post to be pinned or highlighted in any form, to be of assistance to those of us who need it. At least until someone with the right qualifications comes around and creates a better alternative, like a web page or a mobile app.

The list will be composed of links to Google Maps routes. Since it does not allow for multiple routes on the same map, each route will be in its own separate link. If anyone has a better alternative, please let me know, and I'll edit this post accordingly. (Update 1)

To help improve this list, comment with your own Google Maps link containing a new route, or a completion of an existing route. Please include the appropriate descriptions as follows: Starting hub, destination, level of completeness. I can't question the information you provide me, so please try to be as accurate as possible. And I encourage you to constantly review the links provided below and correct me on any mistakes.

**Routes that have no specified hub. I count on you to help clear them up**

* &amp;#x200B;

**Update 1:** Found out that Google Maps allows you create a custom map with multiple routes in it. It's not perfect, but it's better than nothing. I'll keep it at the top of the list. Let me know if anything isn't working as it should.

**Update 2:** Whoopsie. The custom Google Map has a limit on the number of layers I can add. So we can't show all the routes on one map. The ""Entire Map"" will be incomplete. Until a better alternative comes around, I'll create a custom map that show the routes of each hub seperately. I'm looking into Open Street Map to see if it's a better alternative, but so far I'm not sure.",,,,,,2021-10-24 12:14:40

I am finishing here this morning and decided to get an airbnb in Tunis close to the Centre. I plan on taking a taxi to Bourkanine to hike it Friday morning. Can anyone confirm where the beginning of the trailhead is? I looked on alltrails but I am not sure where the actual start of the trail is so I know where to tell the taxi driver to drop me off.  
  
It looks to be a 5-6 hour hike, so if I start around 6-7am I'll be finished around noon or after noon. Is the area near the trail safe enough for me to call another taxi? Or should I tell the driver to come back around the time I finish (would pay him a little extra).  
  
If anyone here would like to drive me, I'd be happy to pay you above market whatever the taxi would charge. I don't think you guys have Uber here I assume either. Just trying to think of the safest way to get there and back to my airbnb. Lastly, I plan to have dinner Friday night in Tunis, before my flight Saturday morning. I love eating local/regional foods. I've had couscous, brik (my favorite) and tunis soup so far in Sahlul and Sousse. Is there any other Tunis dishes/plates I should try and what restaurants near Tunis Centre should I look at?

qjcj5a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/qjcj5a/myth_the_public_sector_has_too_many_employees/,26,"Myth: The public sector has too many employees, debunked","For all those who didn't Hakim Fekih's article [“Trop de dépenses, trop de fonctionnaires” ? Déconstruire le mythe](https://nawaat.org/2020/11/08/trop-de-depenses-trop-de-fonctionnaires-deconstruire-le-mythe/) is a must-read. Here are some highlights

&gt;La Tunisie comptait 41 fonctionnaires pour 1000 habitants en **2010** contre **56 en 2017**  
&gt;  
&gt;Selon les études de l’INS, le nombre de fonctionnaires est passé de **435.487** en 2010 à **642.918** en 2017  
&gt;  
&gt;Ainsi, nous sommes passés de **41** fonctionnaires pour 1000 habitants en **2010** à **56** fonctionnaires pour **1000** habitants en **2017**.  
&gt;  
&gt;A titre de comparaison, et toujours selon l’étude de France Stratégie, la Norvège en a **160**, le Danemark en a **143**, la Suède 139, la Finlande 112, et la liste est encore longue. Même les pays réputés les plus libéraux sont devant nous : Les Etats-Unis sont à **70**, le Royaume Uni à **80**.

So despite the growth in employee numbers in the last 10 years we're still way behind even the most liberal, free market privatisation hell economies like the US. Although *only* the interiour ministry doubled in budget. For example healthcare and education only rose by 30% and 8% so that part is rather wasteful but the defunding since the late 80's of literally *all* ministries *except*  the torture and jail one is a whole other story.

To double check these numbers

12 million / 1000 = 12.000

643,000 (rounded) /12,000 = **53.58 per 1000** **public workers** in Tunisia (2017 numbers). Let's round it to **54**. There, our rough estimate is even lower than the journalist. This [2019 article](https://fr.statista.com/infographie/12768/les-pays-comptant-le-plus-de-fonctionnaires/) citing several OECD countries confirms the numbers he cited with minor updates.

This phenomenon, and the barrage of ugly propaganda to hide it, are not unique or unexpected as the loans (IMF and WB mainly) we've been getting progressively saddled with since the 80's have political conditionalities. Which force us into harsher and harshed austerity like defunding gov. services, institutions, hiring freezes, stunting wages and privatisation.

The ""مسمار في حيط"", unproductive worker (also a myth see: [Tunisian labour productivity](https://www.reddit.com/r/arabs/comments/pyuylq/labour_productivity_trends_for_tunisa_and_north/) stats) is the Tunisian version of ""lazy millenials"" ""welfare queen"" boomer myths people have in the UK and US. It's a blantant lie to convince you to vote and think against your economic interests, and shield the economy that prioritizes the 1% from criticism.

We decide on cruel austerity policies from external pressure, then when public institutions fail from defunding, that failure and deterioration is ascribed to their inherent ""inneficiency"" via propaganda. Therefore justifying even *more* harsh austerity like we're literally having now. And it goes on and on and on. 

Austerity itself is not allowed to be criticized in mainstream media. Despite it's [known catastrophic impact worldwide.](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/over-80-cent-imf-covid-19-loans-will-push-austerity-poor-countries) BY THE IMF itself's rearch.

&gt;The IMF’s own research shows [austerity worsens poverty and inequality](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2016/06/ostry.htm), yet it is encouraging countries which receive loans to roll back inequality-busting measures put into place since the beginning of the pandemic

I wrote a thread just like this the other day about scondinavian countries, and got really amazing replies,So now I wanna know about Qatar,

 I'm currently studying computer science and want to immigrate to live in Qatar (Still have no idea on how to do it, if you have been in a similar situation please let me know)

My reasons to thinking about immigration are as follows:
.)The unemployment is really low in Qatar (I believe it's 0.1%) 
.) They speak Arabic and English ( I suck at french and consider english as my second language)
.) The pay is high as to what I've heard
.) You can basically have a fulfilling life 

So I'm writing this thread to see people's experiences, 
So how has it been? 
How did you Immigrate? ( I like details :) )
Is it as good as people say it is? 
Which one do you prefer Qatar or Tunisia?

I heard much better stuff about ESSTHS and I met with lots of students/people who work there and felt much better at home. I hope I can move before ""les DS"".

-إجا، هات نڨلعليك
-تفضل هاو ڨلعتلك
-صحن مريم؟ هاوكا ڨلعتو/ڨلعتلها فل كوجينا
-etc...

 so it was a specific verb for one specific action.

The thing is , i rarely encounter people outside my extended family who know of it , even local djerbians living their don't use it .... And i don't know of any other word/verb in Arabic or arabic dialects or even other languages that can be used as a Substitute/synonym.

So here I'm asking if anyone can provide one",,,,,,2021-11-07 19:51:34

okay im not sure i """"like"""" his work because it's generally far from perfect. like his work can be as gripping and fun as it can be sloppy &gt;!(dachra's final act, holy shit)!&lt;. but i definitely support the guy and what he's trying to do

i think he's very passionate and really ambitious. the actors he chooses generally have loads of chemistry and he knows how to write believable, snappy dialogue. his directing can be really polished and fartatou dh'hab had some really cool directing ideas imo. but he can be real sloppy at times and not handle 'emotional scenes' super effectively, or rush some parts of his tv shows/movies

So what do you think of the guy? and of tunisian cinema in general?

Also recommend me some cool ass tunisian movies if you know any. im not well versed in tunisian cinema, but the ones i really liked are *Aala Kaf 3efrit (Kaouther Ben Hania)*, *Koul Ettrab/No Man's Love (Nidhal Chatta)* and *Aala Hallet 3ini (Leyla Bouzid)* (this one bcs i was 17 at the time and it got music &amp; girls with curly hair and stuff)",,,,,,2021-11-08 23:57:52

Thousands upon thousands of students did suffer from injustices in their schools , some way more than he did, yet we don't hear about them killing their teachers .
Besides , he showed no signs of remorse whatsoever after the incident, he did run away and had even written # smelltheblood on the table , if he had felt guilty he wouldn't be in an enough stable mental state to think about what to write and do it.
I think he should be charged as an adult to be honest , we all have that one teacher that we absolutely hate yet nobody has serious thoughts about killing them, only those who are not really fit to be a part of society.

Just a sociologist here, with Tunisian decent, but grew up abroad. I am 31 female, and I feel that my family in Tunisia is trying to stay silent about me being single. I feel a lot of pity and confusion on why I am still single, because 'there is nothing wrong with me' and they are afraid I will stay alone forever.

I read this new article. Whether the statistics are true or not, I am taking it as a way for the discussion, mostly about the reasons given.

[https://news.gnet.tn/tunisie-les-jeunes-boudent-le-mariage-les-chiffres-du-celibat-des-34-45-ans-explosent](https://news.gnet.tn/tunisie-les-jeunes-boudent-le-mariage-les-chiffres-du-celibat-des-34-45-ans-explosent)

*Plus de 2.400.000 jeunes femmes entre 34 et 45 ans, ne sont pas mariées, soit 60% de la population féminine en Tunisie. Quant aux hommes, ils sont 81%  de la même tranche d’âge à être  célibataires, selon la dernière enquête  de l’Office national de la famille et de la population, publié en 2020.*

The article mentions different reasons:

**For women:**

*On cite l’hyper scolarité des filles, et le prolongement des parcours universitaires. Le fait d’être plus instruites, garantit aux femmes un meilleur avenir, l’autonomie financière, l’accomplissement personnel et la quête du succès à travers des objectifs professionnels.*

« Une fois cette réalisation de soi a été acquise, les célibataires se rendent compte tardivement qu’ils mènent une vie de solitaire. Plusieurs femmes dans cette situation acceptent finalement le premier venu, pour se caser, d’autres optent pour l’éternel célibat pour éviter l’échec ».

**For men:**

« Ils incluent ceux qui fuient la responsabilité de gérer une famille. Dans la plupart des cas, ce sont les hommes comblés déjà par l’amour de leur mère et le soutien financier et psychologique de leurs proches.

Ils ne ressentent pas le besoin d’avoir une femme dans leur vie, ils ont en déjà une… », note-t-il. «  Habitués à un train de vie plus extraverti, ils refusent de se trouver privés de leurs libertés, et pris au piège du mariage, qui exige une certaine stabilité, une présence continue et un dévouement pour l’autre.

Another reason is more liberal sexual relations and socio-economic reasons (too expensive, too much responsiblities).

***So what do you think? Is this true? And mostly:***

**Is being single 'a failure' and mariage still the first goal?**",,,,,,2021-11-11 18:16:44

qtuei6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/qtuei6/this_brilliant_explanation_of_why_african/,15,This Brilliant Explanation Of Why African Countries Are So Poor (TLDR : It's All The Government's Fault),"**Most economists are agreed on a list of reasons for the failure of Africa to generate economic growth :**  

Many African countries are more or less landlocked, which cuts them off from world trade. They have poor and deteriorating roads linking distant cities. They have exploding birth rates. They suffer from epidemic malaria, AIDS and other diseases such as sleeping sickness and guinea worm. Their institutions have never fully recovered from the disruptions caused by the slave trade. They were once colonies, which meant rule by minorities uninterested in allowing the development of an entrepreneurial class. Thanks to their imperial colonisers, their Marxist independence leaders and their monetarist aid donors, most African countries have lost many of their informal social traditions and institutions, so property rights and justice have become arbitrary and insecure. 

**Their most promising industry – agriculture** – **is usually stifled by price control and bureaucratic marketing agencies imposed by urban elites, and stymied by trade barriers and subsidies in Europe and America**, not to mention devastated by a **proliferation of over-grazing goats**. Ethnic strife between the biggest tribe, which maintains one-party rule, and its hated rival usually poisons politics. Paradoxically, African countries are often also cursed by sudden windfalls of rich mineral wealth, such as oil or diamonds, which serve only to corrupt democratic politicians, strengthen the power of dictators, distract entrepreneurs, spoil the terms of trade of exporters and encourage reckless state borrowing. 

**Now take Botswana, one such typical African country :**  

It is landlocked, drought-prone and has a very high population growth rate. Its people belong to eight different tribes speaking different tongues. When freed from colonial rule in 1966 it had eight miles of paved road (for an area the size of Texas), twenty-two black university graduates, and only 100 secondary school graduates. It was later cursed by a huge diamond mine, crippled by AIDS, devastated by cattle disease, and ruled by one party with little effective opposition. Government spending has remained high; so has wealth inequality. This country, the fourth poorest in the entire world in 1950, has every one of Africa’s curses.

 Its failure was inevitable and predictable. 

**But Botswana did not fail. It succeeded not just moderately well, but spectacularly. In the thirty years after independence it grew its per capita GDP faster on average (nearly 8 per cent) than any other country in the entire world – faster than Japan, China, South Korea and America during that period.** It multiplied its per capita income thirteen times so that its average citizens are now richer than Thais, Bulgarians or Peruvians. It has had no coups, civil wars or dictators. It has experienced no hyperinflation or debt default. It did not wipe out its elephants. It is consistently the most successful economy in the world in recent decades. It is true that Botswana has a small and ethnically somewhat homogeneous population, unlike many other countries. **But its biggest advantage is one that the rest of Africa could easily have shared: good institutions**. In particular, Botswana turns out to have secure, enforceable property rights that are fairly widely distributed and fairly well respected. 

When Daron Acemoglu and his colleagues compared property rights with economic growth throughout the world, they found that the first explained an astonishing three quarters of the variation in the second and that Botswana was no outlier: the reason it had flourished was because its people owned property without fear of confiscation by chiefs or thieves to a much greater extent than in the rest of Africa. This is much the same explanation for why England had a good eighteenth century while China did not. 

**So give the rest of Africa good property rights and sit back and wait for enterprise to work its magic?** 

If only it were that easy. **Good institutions cannot usually be imposed from above: that way they are oxymorons. They must evolve from below**. And it turns out that Botswana’s institutions have deep evolutionary roots. The Tswana people who conquered the native Khoisan tribes in the eighteenth century (and still do not necessarily treat them well) had a political system that was remarkably, well, democratic. Cattle were privately owned, but land was owned collectively.

 The chiefs, who in theory allocated land and grazing rights, were under a strong obligation to consult an assembly, or kgotla. The Tswana were also inclusive, happy to bring other tribes into their system, which stood them in good stead when a collective army was needed to repel the Boers at the battle of Dimawe in 1852. This was a good start, but Botswana then had a stroke of good fortune in its colonial experience. It was incorporated into the British empire in such a half-hearted and inattentive fashion that it barely experienced colonial rule. The British took it mainly to stop the Germans or Boers getting it. ‘Doing as little in the way of administration or settlement as possible’ was explicitly stated as government policy in 1885. **Botswana was left alone, experiencing almost as little direct European imperialism as those later success stories of Asia – places like Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, Korea and China.** In 1895, three Tswana chiefs went to Britain and successfully pleaded with Queen Victoria to be kept out of the clutches of Cecil Rhodes; in the 1930s, two chiefs went to court to prevent another attempt at more intrusive colonial rule and though they failed, the war then kept bossy commissioners at bay. Benign neglect continued.

After independence, Botswana’s first president, Seretse Khama, one of the chiefs, behaved like most African leaders in setting out to build a strong state and disenfranchise the chiefs, as well as to win all future elections (so far so good for his party under two successors). This, together with the extreme poverty of the country and its dependence on foreign aid, foreign labour markets (in South Africa) and the sale of mineral rights to de Beers surely boded badly. **Yet Botswana went from strength to strength by carefully investing its cattle export income and then its diamond windfall to develop other parts of the economy**. Only a devastating AIDS epidemic, which lowered life expectancy between 1992 and 2002, mars the picture, and even that is now retreating.

It is not as if Africa needs to invent enterprise: the streets of Africa’s cities are teeming with entrepreneurs, adept at doing deals, **but they cannot grow their businesses because of blockages in the system**. **The slums of Nairobi and Lagos are terrible places, but the chief fault lies with governments**, which place bureaucratic barriers in the way of entrepreneurs trying to build affordable homes for people. Unable to negotiate the maze of regulations that govern planning, developers leave the poor to build their own slums, brick by brick as they can afford them, outside the law – and then await the official bulldozers. **In Cairo it would take seventy-seven bureaucratic procedures involving thirty-one agencies and up to fourteen years to acquire and register a plot of state-owned land on which to build a house**. No wonder nearly five million Egyptians have decided to build illegal dwellings instead. Typically, a Cairo house owner will build up to three illegal storeys on top of his house and rent them out to relatives. Good for him. 

However, entrepreneurs who start businesses in the West usually finance them with mortgages, and you cannot get a mortgage on an illegal dwelling. The Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto estimates that **Africans own an astonishing $1 trillion in ‘dead capital’ – savings that cannot be used as collateral because they are invested in ill-documented property**. He draws an instructive parallel with the young United States in the early nineteenth century, where the formal codified law was fighting a rearguard action against an increasingly chaotic confusion of informal squatters’ rights to property. More and more states were tolerating and even legalising pre-emption – ownership acquired by settling land and improving it. In the end it was the law that had to give, not the squatters – the law allowing itself to change by bottom-up evolution, not top-down planning. 

The retreat culminated in the Homestead Act of 1862, which formalised what had been happening for many years and signified ‘the end of a long, exhausting and bitter struggle between elitist law and a new order brought about by massive migration and the needs of an open and sustainable society’. The result was a property-owning democracy in which almost everybody had ‘live’ capital, which could be used as collateral for starting a business. Enclosure had played a similar role in Britain earlier, though lack of unoccupied land made the result far less equitable. Revolution eventually achieved property rights for the French poor, too, rather more bloodily, and would probably have done the same for Russians, but for the Bolshevik coup. 

**Property rights are not a silver bullet**. **In some countries, their formalisation simply creates a rentier class.** And China experienced an explosion of enterprise after 1978 without ever giving its people truly secure property rights. But it did allow people to start businesses with relatively little bureaucratic fuss, so another of De Soto’s recommendations is to free up the rules governing business. 

**Whereas it takes a handful of steps to set up a company in America or Europe, De Soto’s assistants found that to do the same in Tanzania would take 379 days and cost $5,506**. **Worse, to have a normal business career in Tanzania for fifty years, you would have to spend more than a thousand days in government offices petitioning for permits of one kind or another and spending $180,000 on them. Little wonder that a staggering 98 per cent of Tanzanian businesses are extralegal.** That does not mean they are governed by no rules: far from it. 

De Soto’s study found thousands of examples of documents being used by people on the ground to attest ownership, record loans, embody contracts and settle disputes. Handwritten papers, sometimes signed with thumbprints, are being drafted, witnessed, stamped, revised, filed and adjudicated all over the country. Just as Europeans did before the formal law gradually ‘nationalised’ their indigenous customs, **Tanzanians are evolving a system of self-organised complexity to allow them to do business with strangers as well as neighbours.** 

**One handwritten, single-page document, for example, records a contract for a business loan between two individuals – the amount of the loan, the interest rate, the payment period and the collateral (the debtor’s house) – and is signed, witnessed and stamped by the local elder**. But these customs, these laws of the people, are a fragmented jigsaw. They work well for sole traders in small communities, but being dependent on local people and local rules they cannot help the ambitious entrepreneur who tries to expand beyond his local community.

 **What Tanzania needs to do, as Europe and America did hundreds of years ago, is not to enforce its unaffordable official legal system, but gradually to encourage this bottom-up, informal law to broaden and standardise itself**. De Soto’s team identified sixty-seven bottlenecks that prevent the poor using the legal system to generate wealth. It is this kind of institutional reform that will in the end do far more for African living standards than dams, factories, aid or population control. 

In the 1930s, Nashville, Tennessee, was rescued from poverty by its music entrepreneurs, using good local copyright laws to start recording indigenous music, not by the giant dams of the Tennessee Valley Authority. Likewise, Bamako in Mali could build upon its strong musical traditions given the right copyright laws and entrepreneurial spirit. In a neat example of bottom-up change, the poor have taken to mobile telephones with unexpected gusto all across Africa, to the surprise of those who thought this a luxury technology for a later stage of development.

 In Kenya, despairing of state-controlled landlines, one-quarter of the population acquired a mobile phone after 2000. **Kenyan farmers call different markets to find the best prices before setting out with their produce, and are better off for it.** Studies of rural villages in Botswana find that the ones that have mobile reception have more non-farm jobs than the ones that do not. **Mobile phones not only enable people to get work, but also to pay for and be paid for services – mobile phone credits having become in effect a form of informal banking and payments system. In Ghana, manufacturers of T-shirts can be paid directly by American buyers using phone credits.**

 **Micro-finance banking, mobile telephony and the internet are now merging to produce systems that allow individuals in the West to make small loans to entrepreneurs in Africa** **(through websites like Kiva), who can then use their mobile phone credits to deposit receipts and pay bills without waiting for banks to open and without handling vulnerable cash**. These developments offer opportunities to the poor of Africa that were not available to the poor of Asia a generation ago. 

They are one reason that Africa saw economic growth rise to Asian-tiger levels in the late 2000s.

The Bardo's social media hasn't been updated in like, forever and they don't even appear to have an official Twitter account. 

The website still says ""مغلق حاليا"" on it which I assume is up to date, but just double-checking since government websites in Tunisia tend to not be updated very quickly, to put it as an understatement: [http://www.bardomuseum.tn/index.php?option=com\_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=53&amp;Itemid=59&amp;lang=ar](http://www.bardomuseum.tn/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=53&amp;Itemid=59&amp;lang=ar)

I guess that's the latest, but I just wanted to know if maybe the were trying to find a solution to open it, or maybe all the curators and the hallway guards are happy to be able to sit at home, probably collect their paychecks, and wait until who knows when for parliament to be unsuspended. I haven't heard anything since the new cabinet got announced more than a month ago, but it seems like the Bardo could even be closed for another few months or even couple years until there's a new election or whatever and parliament reopens.

In the few past months i tried to subscribe to a plan on Spotify and it actually worked, Spotify gave me 1 month free trial but after that month Spotify couldn't profit from my credit card so the subscription was cancelled. At that point i thought it is not possible to pay international services like Spotify (only if you own international credit card) so now i am asking is there anyone here in Tunisia currently paying Spotify subscription? if yes then i need to go to check my situation with the bank.

Thank you.",,,,,,2021-11-20 22:58:34

Why/why not? (Guys I'm interested in your opinions too)","I'm 27yo guy. I want to get married and I have an extensive list of criteria that I prefer they would be in my future wife. But I have few mandatory ones. One of them is staying at home for many personal reasons that I wouldn't like to explain in this sub.

I'd like to know what girls think about staying at home after marriage. she'd have her monthly personal money (let's say 300dt for her only, she can keep them or use them or do whatever she wants with them), while all her wants and needs (7ajjema and clothes and accessories  and restaurants and food and 9adhyet dar etc..)still on me.

Also I wouldn't try to foul her, I'll invoke this point from the start of the relationship and we'd talk about it and negotiate till we find a good compromise between us.
So she wouldnt be like ""I've never thought you were like this"".

Any opinions, thoughts, ideas and critiques might help. Thank you.

Edit: one comment mentioned ""خديمة"".. it's not like that at all.. we'd be living abroad, mekla cherba w teddallel kima t7eb w techt'hi, and on top of all that she'd be having some private money for herself.. idk if this all qualifies as ""خديمة""..!!

Edit 2: People.. 300dt is just an example.. it'd be more like 300 euros since I'm planning to live abroad.
Also I've only talked about work.. but that sum would be after we talk w netfehmou.. it's just and EXAMPLE..
She can have a social life, friends and such if she wants to..
Also I'm not gonna FORCE her to stay at home.. it'll be her choice. As it would be mine not to continue in a relationship where she wants to work.

Also to answer some of u.. one of the major reasons why I don't want her to work is because most jobs have male majorities.. most guys are disgusting when it comes to working with women.. it's not a topic for a debate.. I've seen it.. it's what made me decide on this criteria.

Also I'm I'm type of guy who don't go to coffee with friends.. just an introvert who loves to chill at home..",,,,,,2021-11-22 12:20:01

They descended from the Egyptian Empire where Western thought ACTUALLY originated from (Lots of Greek philosophers studied there).

They managed to build a gigantic commercial empire MOSTLY through pacific ways.

Their swift ships created the first large-scale globalization that we know today.

Their alphabet is used everywhere (latin, greek, arabic, hebrew, farsi and ethiopian alphabets all descends from theirs, which originated from Hieroglyphs, not kidding).

They brought peace, prosperity, ideas and technologies, to many people accross the Mediterranean sea.

Trading Hubs where people can meet different people and start questioning their own beliefs and identities (Thales de Milet).

They were merchants, not warriors, who valued exchange, honesty and hard work over conquests and parasitic governance like the Romans, Greeks and Arabs did.

They were TOLERANT. As long as they can do business with you, they don't care what you look like or what your beliefs are.

Literrally created the whole ""Mediterranean Culture"" thing.

Carthage was the first democratic republic ever, with the first Constitution.

They cared more about money than God, which is ACTUALLY a good thing. Merchants brings you wine, pearls, silk, honey, food, olive oil, spices, technologies, ideas, teachers, art and everything you didn't know you wanted or needed. Religious fanatics only brings you Crusades and Djihads.

If Carthage f\*cked the Romans up, Europe would have never been forcibly converted to Christianity and would have retained their own extremely diverse languages, cultures and religious practices (pretty much like India today). Almost nothing is left of old Celtic and Germanic cultures :(

A world shaped by the Phoenicians and not the Warmongerers that followed (Alexandre the not so Great, Ceasar, Scipio, Constantin, etc) could have lead us to the Industrial Revolution muuuch sooner and we would have conquered space already.

Their treaties on Agriculture (Magon) were Priceless. Nothing is left of it thanks to the Romans. 99% of knowledge built up by the Ancient is lost forever, thanks to the ""Glorious"" conquerers, that everyone remembers because they had good marketing teams and killed countless innocents. Who remembers the scientists, the engineers, architects, workers and business man who allowed culture and knowledge to flourish ? Nobody.

The history we learned at school was built by killers who wanted to be ""remembered"", to become immortal.

Phoenicians never sought such things. That's why no one cares.

Now it's time to change.",,,,,,2021-11-23 07:40:49

I joined a while ago but never felt the need to give my opinion about topics I've crossed.

(Well, tbh, I don't spend a lot of time on this platform.)

I will probably switch to french or derja because I spent more than 5 minutes to write these lines.

So, I started taking [Djembé](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Lenke_djembe_from_Mali.jpeg) courses a year ago (post-pandemic resolution) and I think it's one of the best decisions I've ever made.

I don't know why I ""waited"" this long to start learning any instrument.

I'm enjoying the process and I hope this post will motivate you to start, it's never too late. \*cliché detected\*

If you have already try and you didn't enjoy, it's okay!

Yesterday I got my Payoneer/Master Card delivered to my country exactly at Tunisia, TUNIS CENTRE DE TRI, I went there to take it while having 10+ documents from Payonner/Fiverr+my National ID to verify my Identity and my founding sources, yet they refused to give it to me, I was so frustrated so I went to the Central Bank to get an authorization or something, they gave me one!! went back to Diwan-Officer, still she refused to give to me and she said that doesn't matter what documents I provide even if they're form outer space, I won't get the card, she was acting fully aggressive and refusing to listen to my explanation and she just signed + wrote refused on the card package and she returned it, I want to know if anyone had a similar issue? I already got a document from the Central Bank admitting that my online-freelance work is legal, yet it seems worthless for other government agencies to accept? should I resend the card and try again? any advisees will be appreciated, thanks for reading
**UPDATE: For anyone reading this in the future, i got the card, just never go to tri center when they show you ""documents required"" in the tracking site, and just wait until you get a notice that it was delivered to your local post office or to your home.

I want to make some money online or otherwise, I'm really good with Photoshop and digital art, from drawing to editing and manipulating images, I'm a noob programmer, I'm learning unity and android studio, done a couple of apps and games just for fun. I have a Paypal account so getting my money online is no problem. Also there's Payoneer. I'm good with tech stuff, computers and any electronics, I've built and repaired computers for years so I know a couple of things about hardware and software. 

Things I've tried , I have an upwork account all setup,  fiver account, they're both a few months old. I suck at doing all the marketing crap, I watched endless hours of videos on Youtube for guidance and stuff but got nowhere, things aren't as easy as they seem in videos even if I put in hours of work daily for months. Maybe I'm too damn retarded, idk.

I can also manage to invest in small things for revenue if such things exist, I know Tunisia sucks when it comes to small investments so I'm asking if there's anything that can be done say with 5k tnd. I don't mind small revenue, if I can manage a 5-10% profit that'd be perfect.

I cam on this sub looking for any type of info because I'm desperate, I asked people around but everyone is just too damn secretive even friends, no one wants to help or give their income secrets... Like I'm some KGB agent... My health is deteriorating and so I can't do any physically demanding jobs anymore hence why I'm desperate for less labor intense jobs.

I, like a good number of people here, have stuggled with mental health problems. I am in the process of seeking help. But one of the things that I came across in my readings about the matter is how support groups and especially those targeted towards men can be very beneficial in addition to whatever form of therapy one is seeking. I think there are a lot of stuff that have been highly stigmatized among us. Masculinity, insecurities, self-image, our quest for approval from others, expectations from society, relationships etc ... are all things that are brushed off and believed to be dealt with inherently. You're supposed to ""man up"" but are never told how to.

Whether we like or not, our sittings with other male friends are mostly geared towards pleasentry and just ""chilling"". Of course there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. I find it a crucial part of our development. But I'd also want to be in a sitting where  I can freely  share my experience, struggles, insecurities with other fellow men and get their feedback without being judged.

I didn't want to make it a lengthy post. There are still specifics that I have in mind. But what do you all think about this? Would you want to have a weekly support group with established ""safe space"" rules where you could go and vent to others who are like you and are more likely to understand you? Would you be willing to participate in a small trial, for example, to see what it could yield?

My DMs are open for anyone who wants to discuss this idea further!",,,,,,2021-12-02 21:46:55

I have 2 questions:

1. Where can I learn to play these games?

2. I want to try and meet Tunisians that live near me and I was wondering if women also play these games or if they are just “for men,” culturally speaking.

Thanks for any help you can give! I love Tunisian culture and I’m trying to learn more.

I'm in my final year of college, studying SWE.  My plan was to finish my diploma and then look for a graduate position elsewhere, mainly in europe.

I asked people around me (professors, friends with more work experience ..) if it is a solid plan and i got the same response;  it's better to work in Tunisia for a couple of years for experience and then apply for jobs in europe.

I definitely know it's not easy to get a first job in europe. But i just want to make sure that it is at least possible . 

So, if anyone has gone through this. I would love to know your input; how was it, what countries to aim for etc ..

rewsxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/rewsxj/there_are_frankly_no_people_more_ignorant_or/,6,"There are frankly no people more ignorant or stupid than Arab Zionists, Tunisian ones especially.","The amount of regurgitated Zionist propaganda is insane. Not to talk of blind reverence to certain leaders with questionable views. Here's the stereotypical points:

* Bourguiba told them to accept the results of the Nakba and half their land colonised! he was right

Bourguiba also disarmed el fallagua and wanted to stop at ""internal"" independence only. Decolonisation happened despite him, not thanks to him. Not to mention his vitriolic hatred of Amazigh speakers and people from the inner regions. He is by no means a) an authority on colonialism and b) it's insane to ask people to accept ethnically cleansing half the population and losing 55% of their land to settler-colonialism.

And most importantly, the Zionist side wanted the whole area and had no intention of honouring the first ""partition"" anyway so that's a moot point. From the [Peel commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peel_Commission)

&gt; The Zionist leadership was bitterly divided over the plan. In a resolution adopted at the 1937 Zionist Congress, the delegates **rejected** the specific partition plan. Yet the principle of partition is generally thought to have been ""accepted"" or ""not rejected outright"" by any major faction: the delegates empowered the leadership to pursue future negotiations. The [Jewish Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Agency) Council later attached a request that a conference be convened to explore a peaceful settlement in terms of **an undivided Palestine**. According to [Benny Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Morris), Ben-Gurion and Weizmann saw it **'as a stepping stone to some further expansion and the eventual takeover of the whole of Palestine**.’

Pretentious ""peace loving"" sympathizers of Zionism legit forget it's a fascist colonial movement. Their ideal result **IS** the eradication of Palestinians entirely.

* Boycotts don't help the Palestinians

Says who? They *ask* for it anyway. Just like people advocated [boycotting Apartheid South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Apartheid_Movement). Just like they advocated [boycotting Nazi Germany](https://www.nytimes.com/1933/03/21/archives/boycott-advocated-to-curb-hitlerism-ww-cohen-says-any-jew-who-buys.html) in the 30's. It's an obvious and non-violent pressure card. If the parallels aren't obvious enough see [here](https://www.nytimes.com/1933/05/08/archives/untermyer-urges-german-boycott-calls-on-americans-to-ban-all.html) (New york times, 1933)

&gt;UNTERMYER URGES GERMAN BOYCOTT; Calls on Americans to Ban All Products and Refuse to Use Ships and Visit Reich  
&gt;  
&gt;**A boycott by the American people of the products of all German industries, with the withdrawal of their patronage from German ships and their refusal to visit Germany, was recommended here today by Samuel Untermyer as the ""obvious remedy"" in dealing with the anti-Semitic activities of the National Socialists and the Hitler regime** 

* Normalizing with Israel will bring us progress ... *somehow*

We have perfectly normal relations with every ""advanced"" country on the face of the earth, yet nothing happened and somehow it's Israel specifically that's the be-all end-all of science and progress. lol

How will Israel supposedly ""bring us"" advancement and *why would it* is left to the imagination.

* You can't physically boycott Israel! don't you know literally everything good and holy in the known universe is made in Israel? 

Juvenile argument. You can very much boycott Israeli companies and tactically boycott foreign ones who invest there, especially the West Bank. Pretending everything is made in Israel is not a good faith argument. 

* The Evil / emotional / antisemitic / stupid  Palestinians kept rejecting peace and a state!

[No they didn't](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/ft6n0z/palestinian_rejectionism_is_the_most_blatently/). The Palestinian offer was literally full citizenship and equality for the very recent Jewish migrants under one state. Contrast this with a literal ethnic cleansing plan and division into 3 Bantustans.. **Zionists are literally** **fascists.** 

Fascists are not rational people with reasonable goals. You literally cannot reason an ideology built on ethnic cleansing and genocide out of itself. All claims to the contrary are the emotional and irrational ones. 

* what about Saudi Arabia? or \[insert country here\] why not boycott them you hypocrite?

Who's stopping you? boycott them lol. For all the shit you find in the Arab world there's literally no other Apartheid state. No other still existing colonialism. Israel has been a force of destabilisation and violence in the region for decades. It's not some ""normal"" country.",,,,,,2021-12-12 19:54:16

I am writing here hoping I can get some guidance or help to know what should I do.

I am a Tunisian Engineer (from a private university) who is moving to Japan for work.  
I have a passport that will be expired in a year and I would like to renew it when I am there.  
My ID card says I am a student, and so, I am unable to renew the passport here without renewing my ID card as well (since I cannot have a student certificate).  
Note: the passport requires the certificate as long as it says ""student"" on my ID card.  
I am limited in time and I am unable to renew my ID card when in Japan.   
Does that mean I will have to return before the expiration of my passport? and if I happen to not be able to return in time, what would happen?  
Thank you in advance for your efforts.",,,,,,2021-12-15 14:23:02

Update: I called him, he told me that he refuses to go to the Sokra clinic.

rk89eh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/rk89eh/some_thoughts_about_our_trip_to_tunisia/,68,Some thoughts about our trip to Tunisia,"We came back from Tunis a couple of days ago and we really enjoyed it!

Here you have some thoughts as I promised to u/maroxtn 

The people were very kind everywhere, always helpful when being asked for directions or anything and also offering help when I guess we looked kind of lost. Even when we didn't have any language in common, they did our best to try to understand each other.

Many people approached to interact with our baby, some of them even taking her directly from our arms without asking just to kiss her or simply hold her for a while XD

There was close to 0 tourists anywhere (at least european-looking) which was kind of cool.

The food was really good despite my gf didn't enjoy it many times because she doesn't have much tolerance to spicy food and many times not-spicy wasn't an option in casual restaurants.

The only countries in the region I've visited are Morocco and Egypt and compared with them Tunisia felt like more laid-back: Almost zero car-honking, close to 0 harassing vendors,... And we never felt insecure. In those other countries often I had the impression of being constantly cheated, not in Tunisia. The only time we were properly scammed was with the late night taxi from the airport to the medina when we first got there. The driver agreed to turn on the taximeter so I was kind of relieved but then when we were distracted I guess he added like 1000 extras or manipulated it somehow to inflate the price a lot in the taximeter, I didn't realize until the end and it was about midnight so that time I simply surrendered and paid XD

Tunisair wasn't good,but not as bad as I expected, it went 30min late and the toilet was really uncomfortable, specially to change our baby, but the food wasn't that horrible. On our flight back, the captain happily announced through the speakers the victory of Tunis over Egypt haha

About our route, we ended up renting a car after exploring Tunis. We had to change our initial itinerary because Kesra and El Kef were more cold than we expected, as our baby had a cold, so after having lunch in Kesra it didn't feel like a good idea to stay there neither go to El Kef. So our final itinerary was Tunis-Kairouan-El Djem-Kesra-Dougga-Testour-Cartaghe/La Goulette.


Tunis was fine but we usually don't spend much time in any capital, so skipped quickly after visiting some of the highlights in the old town.

About Kairouan, it was our favorite medina, very beautiful. What a pity we cannot go inside the praying area in the mosque but we enjoyed everything we could from the inner court. Amazing details also in the zaouias, very similar to Alhambra.

I went into a hammam one day in Kairouan (first time in north africa), I was asked if I wanted a massage and said yes. After relaxing for a bit I waited for my turn for the massage while watching other man receiving it and I saw that instead of a massage it consisted on being rubbed with some kind of mitten, when it was my turn I soon realized that the mitten was full of spikes so I tried to hold on until the end as if it didn't hurt to have 70% of my skin peeled off with that weird glove... XD Actually I still have my upper chest full of little scabs..

El Djem and Dougga were impressive as you well know.

Testour was a last-minute decision, it was recommended to us during our stay in Tunis, but it ended up being one of our favorite places! The clock counting backwards, the cheese, the landscape,...

What a pity we couldn't stay in Kesra, it felt like a perfect place to chill for a few days to meet locals and enjoy the atmosphere, El Kef too. Hopefully some day we'll come back, in spring if possible, and explore better the west and south of the country.

PS: u/saihi We confirmed the fact about no-smoking signs in the restaurants and being offered and ashtray XD",,,,,,2021-12-19 23:03:07

rkcxny,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/rkcxny/questions_sur_les_finances_et_la_religion/,1,Questions sur les finances et la religion.,"Bonjour,

La plupart des messages de ce subreddit semblent être en anglais, mais les règles disent que le français est une des trois langues permises. J'espère que c'est approprié.

Je me pose quelques questions au sujet de la vie en Tunisie, particulièrement par rapport aux finances. Je dois avouer qu'il est très intéressant que voir comment différents pays fonctionnent. Cependant, j'ai de la difficulté à m'imaginer.

J'ai lu qu'il faut commencer à payer de l'impôt à partir de seulement 5 000 dinars de revenu. Je croyais que 5 000 dinars était le salaire minimum. Est-ce que tout les gens qui font au-dessus du salaire minimum paient vraiment de l'impôt sur le revenu ? Remarquez, dans mon pays c'est encore pire, on est taxé à partir de la moitié du salaire minimum...

J'ai aussi lu que la taxe de vente est de 18%. Est-ce qu'il y a des exemptions pour les nécessités, comme la nourriture ?

Est-ce qu'il y a des taxes foncières sur les résidences ? Autres taxes auxquelles je n'ai pas pensé, possiblement parce que j'ignore leur existence ?

Il semble que l'inflation soit assez élevée en Tunisie. Qu'est-ce que les gens font avec leur argent ? Ils investissent, ou est-ce que les taux d'intérêts offerts par les banques sont aussi élevés pour compenser ?

Parlant d'intérêt, je sais que certaines variations de la religion abrahamique interdit de faire de l'argent au travers des intérêts, est-ce que cela affecte les options d'investissement en Tunisie ?

Je n'arrive pas vraiment à trouver à quel point le pays est religieux. Certains sondages affirment que presque tout le monde dit être religieux, mais d'autres indiquent que une personne sur trois dit ne pas être religieux. Presque la moitié pour les jeunes !

Il est encore plus difficile d'imaginer quel effet cela a sur la vie de tous les jours. Par exemple, j'ai lu des témoignages de touristes au Maroc ayant été bloqués à leur porte de chambre d'hôtel par des gens qui insistaient pour voir une preuve qu'ils étaient mariés avant de les laisser entrer ensemble ; est-ce quelque chose qui pourrait arriver en Tunisie ? Ou est-ce qu'il n'y a virtuellement aucun impact ? Ce n'est pas le genre de donnée qu'on peut trouver dans un tableau sur internet.

Je ne suis pas sûr de l'information que j'ai et c'est déplaisant. J'apprécierais toute clarification.

Merci.

Edit: I don't mind English-language answers. The statistics I saw claimed that most internet users in Tunisia prefer using French online, even more than Arabic and English combined. Maybe that's different on reddit.

Edit2: and absolutely nothing on finance yet, only religion. Are finances not a thing that people care about in Tunisia?

Edit3: Bon... on m'a dit en privé que la Tunisie est beaucoup, beaucoup plus religieuse qu'elle le prétend. Au point absurde ou les gens peuvent aller en prison pour six mois juste pour s'être embrassés en public. Honnêtement ça a complètement changé mon opinion du pays, au point ou je ne pense même plus visiter. C'est très triste et j'exprime mes sympathies aux Tunisiens qui doivent vivre dans ces conditions inacceptables.",,,,,,2021-12-20 02:57:24

I would like to buy a house for my mum somewhere near the beach (Sfax, Monastir). I'm Tunisian but was born &amp; live abroad, thus does anyone know whether it is best for me to ask for a loan at a bank in Tunisia as an expat or to ask for a loan directly in my country of residence?

Has anyone been in that situation and would like to share their experience? Also how do you even search for a house (i went online but didn't find good websites, any recommendations?) 

I have no idea how this works so I did some google search but found various answers which makes me a bit confused, thus any feedback from someone who has been through a similar situation would be super helpful!

وأكّد رئيس الجمهورية على أنه لا أساس من الصحّة لما يقع تداوله في بعض وسائل التواصل الاجتماعي بخصوص مشروع قانون المالية لسنة 2022، وشدّد على أن إعداد هذه الوثيقة تم ّ في إطار حرص الدولة على بعث رسائل إيجابية لمختلف الفاعلين الاقتصاديين في الداخل وشركاء تونس والأطراف المانحة في الخارج، فضلا عن البحث عن تحقيق استقرار التوازنات المالية العمومية سنة 2022 لانطلاق التعافي على المدى المتوسّط.

وسيُمكّن برنامج الإصلاحات المضمّنة في مشروع قانون المالية لسنة 2022 من تحقيق نمو اقتصادي شامل ومستدام، وتحسين مناخ الأعمال وإعادة الثقة مع شركاء تونس حتى تظل بلادنا وجهة جاذبة للاستثمار، بالإضافة إلى المحافظة على الدور الاجتماعي للدولة وإرساء جباية عادلة لا تثقل كاهل المؤسسات والأفراد، وتحسين حوكمة القطاع العام، وتعزيز إجراءات مجابهة تداعيات الأزمة الصحية.

وتمحور مشروع قانون المالية لسنة 2022 حول جملة من الإجراءات الاجتماعية والاقتصادية التي تراعي حاجيات مختلف الفئات والقطاعات.

ويتضمن هذا المشروع عدة إجراءات اجتماعية من أهمّها الترفيع في المنحة المسندة إلى العائلات المعوزة، واسناد منحة شهرية لفائدة أبناء العائلات محدودة ومتوسطة الدخل دون 6 سنوات، والمحافظة على المساعدات والتحويلات الاجتماعية، ومواصلة اسناد منحة الاندماج في الحياة الجامعية لكل ناجح في الباكالوريا ينتمي إلى عائلة ضعيفة أو متوسطة الدخل، علاوة على تخفيف العبء الجبائي على رياض الأطفال المنخرطة في برنامج النهوض بالطفولة المبكرة الموجه لأطفال العائلات المعوزة ومحدودة الدخل.

كما يرمي مشروع قانون المالية لسنة 2022 إلى تدعيم عمليات تعهد وصيانة المؤسسات التربوية وتحسين ظروف الإقامة المدرسية بالمبيتات خاصة بالجهات الداخلية، واستحثاث أشغال لجان قيادة برنامج السكن الاجتماعي، واحداث خط تمويل يخصص لمؤسسات الاقتصاد الاجتماعي والتضامني، وإحداث حساب خاص في الخزينة مخصص لتنويع مصادر تمويل صناديق الضمان الاجتماعي، وتمويل مشاريع صغرى لفائدة الفئات الهشة والمعاقين، والمحافظة على القدرة الشرائية من خلال التحكم في أسعار بيع المواد الفلاحية والأعلاف، فضلا عن المحافظة على أسعار بيع المواد المدعمة الموجهة للمواطن.

وتضمّن مشروع قانون المالية لسنة 2022 إجراءات اقتصادية لمساندة المؤسسات الاقتصادية وتشجيع المبادرة الخاصة وخلق مواطن الشغل، وتعبئة الادخار لدفع الاستثمار وتحسين مناخ الأعمال، وتشجيع الاقتصاد الاجتماعي والتضامني، ومقاومة التهرب الجبائي والتهريب وادماج الاقتصاد الموازي، وتعميم الرقمنة، من ذلك إحداث صندوق الشراكة بين القطاعين الخاص والعام، وتدعيم الأموال الذاتية للمؤسسات وتيسير حصولها على التمويلات، وتنفيل فائض القروض المسندة لفائدة المؤسسات الصغرى والمتوسطة، والتسريع في إحداث الشركات عن بعد، بالإضافة إلى مضاعفة الاعتمادات المخصصة لتشجيع احداث المشاريع الفردية للشباب.

كما ورد بمشروع قانون المالية لسنة 2022، في جانبه الاقتصادي، عدّة إجراءات ترمي إلى تشجيع الاقتصاد الأخضر والتنمية المستدامة والتحول الطاقي، والتشجيع على استعمال الطاقات البديلة والمحافظة على البيئة وتمويل عمليات مراقبة وفرز وتثمين النفايات. 

وتضمّن مشروع قانون المالية لسنة 2022، أيضا، إجراءات لمجابهة تداعيات الأزمة الصحية من بينها احداث خط تمويل للمؤسسات الصغرى والمتوسطة المتضررة جراء جائحة كورونا، ومساندة المؤسسات السياحية والصناعات التقليدية، ومساعدة أجراء القطاع السياحي والصناعات التقليدية والأدلاء السياحيين.",,,,,,2021-12-22 19:14:12

rqm05x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/rqm05x/advice_for_a_desperate_person/,11,Advice for a desperate person.,"I have a bachelor's degree in IT (with average results, the typicial I was a brilliant student that didn't need to study to get great marks, then university hits hard and you realize you don't have the needed mindset/habits to study) I took a year off due to depression after getting my diploma thinking I'd be able to get my shit together but unfortunately it got worse. Suicidal thoughts everyday, staying in bed, not being able to do anything due to low energy and all that good stuff. 

The year went by just like that. I was pressured to apply to a masters degree, so I did, I got accepted into an IT related field. I studied for a year and a half, it kept my mind busy but I was still struggling with depression. It went downhill the 2nd year since we're required to do an internship. Due to low self esteem and poor communication skills, my applications were denied and I didn't meet the deadline so I failed that semester and I had to wait another year for the next 'internship season'. 

As usual, depression grew worse, I wasn't able to do anything for another year. To rub salt into the wound, I wasn't able to get an internship again due to the previous reasons and the fact that I have 2 gap years in my CV, also I have no connections, my CV doesn't stand out so It is what it is. 

My prof managed to get me an internship before the deadline, but it didn't go well, my supervisor ended up ghosting me, and I was blamed for not being able to get into contact with them regardless of my countless efforts to do so. There were issues with the project objectives, they didn't tell me what to do about them, so I improvised and I tried to work with what they provided me. Now I can't get my training certificate since I didn't do what they asked, and basically I'm getting kicked from the masters since I already 'failed' for 2 years.

At this point, I stopped caring about the diploma, I really want to live but I don't know how to, I'm afraid of getting 'blacklisted' because of this damned internship, and I don't want to apply to a private university since it'll be burdensome on the family (that's if I get accepted in the first place), everything seems unreachable whatever I do. I want to stop fighting for this stupid diploma, drop everything and fix my depression, whatever I say or do I'll always end up being wrong since 'they're always right and the student is always wrong'. 

Please help me.",,,,,,2021-12-28 18:17:42

rrkdq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/rrkdq8/i_cringe_so_hard_and_feel_repelled_when_my_gf/,25,I cringe so hard and feel repelled when my gf starts talking with me about the sex she had with her exes. should I be worried that deep inside I am still conservative ?,"So I (23M) virgin, met a cute girl (20F) and we have been together for 3 weeks. She is virgin as well but had outercourse before unlike me. So she is more experienced and open to crazy stuff. Which is not the case for me.

I am so open-minded about us having sex and I already told her that I don't care if she is virgin or not because I refuse to judge a girl based on bodily characteristics. However, when I talk with her about her exes and she would get into details of how they had sex with her. I get super uncomfortable and can't help but cringe so hard. I don't know the reason for that. It might be that I am being jealous or simply disgusted with the activities she had done.

This is causing me an identity crisis because I always believed I am unlike the rest of the flock. I am open minded and secular and don't think that sex should be considered a wrongful thing because it's only natural. However, when she talks about how she had sex with her exes, I get a strong urge to leave or change the subject.

Since we live in the same country and have few similarities, have you guys had a similar feeling to this when talking with your girlfriend about her previous sexual experiences ?

Edit : I think that some of you are getting too judgmental and aggressive. I appreciated the comments with the actual advices more than the comments with passive judgment. 

The reason I made the post here and not in r/relationship_advice, is because I wanted to know if my feelings are similar to those of you so I could logically determine if they are the byproduct of something beyond my control namely religion, societal norms, traditions... Unfortunately, I am at a point where I completely distrust my system and have to distinguish reasonable feelings and intentions from unreasonable ones. Comparing my feelings to those of others (that share similarities with me) helps me pinpoint the reasons I am feelings this way and change them if need be. 

My gf didn't talk about her previous sexual experiences because she felt like it. I asked her intentionally because I wanted to dig deeper into those feelings I can't control and understand the reasons behind them. I wanted to know If my repulsion was induced by sexual frustration, possessiveness, or jealousy and see if those could be controlled or removed.

Some of you say that feelings of repulsion are normal because they are natural in this case. But some of those ""natural feelings"" are what moves some people to commit homicide. In middle eastern cultures such ""natural feelings"" are the foundation of traditions that force genital mutilation on women. Natural feelings shouldn't be trusted and human beings should learn to alter and change those feelings according to reason. That's what I am trying to do and that's what's causing me this crisis which I intend to solve desperately by asking questions here.",,,,,,2021-12-29 22:15:04

Who made moderators Specialists on SARS-COV-2 or COVID-19 to decide who to ban and on what grounds ?

Shouldn't this be an open space for discussion instead of inforcing one hard line based on X or Y moderator's opinions ?

And then you Complain about Saayed fucking the democracy in its ass ? Obviously any person with any semblance of power in this country tends to abuse of it. Why not him ... At least he was elected for the job by popular vote ...
