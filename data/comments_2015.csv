The attacks by ISIS may affect the tourism in the short term (maybe not), but what it won't affect is the power of the people here.

cr0968r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/34vf9k/,6,"I am/was in poor health.  I'm much better now, still not great.  Sometimes when flying you can form blood clots.  Well, I formed one in the main artery to my lungs.  On top of it, I got bronchitis.  Me being a Male and stupid, I ignored the first warning signs of being constantly fatigued and short of breath to just having traveled such a long freakin' distance.

It got worse and worse until I was in the shower and nearly passed out.  I was coughing up stuff already but I nearly went down in the shower.  I crawl out, barely make it to the bed and my then fiance starts freaking out as I got no color to my face and looked dazed.  I honest to God thought I was dying.  I had that thought running through my head as I felt the life quickly fade as I started to slump over.  The only thing I thought of ""Just look at her face, you're dying, make that the last thing you see"" over and over.  Some reason, I didn't quite pass out.  She called an ambulance and it took nearly an hour to get me to it as I'd take 3 steps and need to sit down.  Diagnosed with severe bronchitis and blocked artery so what little blood WAS getting to my lungs, wasn't getting oxygenated because there was so much fluid in my lungs it was horrible.

After 5 days in the hospital I finally check out.  I was getting better and would cough up whole mouth fulls of water.  Like, it wasn't mucus I would cough and blech full of water.  So they put me on some blood thinners to help with the clot.  Again, very big guy, not much they could do here as they aren't equipped for fat people.  Well, I was shedding weight as I was barely eating and losing weight fast. The blood thinner was being absorbed into my fat and not into my system as much.  After being home a few days I started feeling very sick.  Come to find out as I'm losing lots of weight (fat) the medicine was being released into my system in gigantic doses.  I started pissing blood and rushed to the hospital again.  There I started puking up straight blood.  They were having to do transfusions from the get go.  I was in the ICU and my previous doctor busts through the door at full sprint because he saw my blood clotting numbers and said it was the lowest he'd seen in 30 years of medicine and by all account, should be bleeding out of every hole and through my skin.  

Things got better though and I'm down about 140 pounds.  I was doing well but gained some back as I got out more I could find stores with shitty food again.  I'm back on track however and lost probably 10 pounds or so in the past week+.

It was incredible the amount of shit I had to go through right as I got here and the amount of shit I put her through.  I was so bad, maybe TMI so be warned and stop reading here, that I couldn't shit alone.  I had to have her wipe and shower me when needed and hold a jug for me to piss in.  Even at 3am I'd have to wake her up from a dead sleep to go get the jug and help me pee.

I wifed her up the SECOND I could.",2015-05-06 14:52:00

cpf80b3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/2z1fie/,5,"Well, as a network engineer, there are many reasons and it's kinda complex:
First of all, bad phone cables and bad installations. Generally these cables are hanged by poles and they are directly esposed to heat in summer and cold in winter. As a result, the electric signal gets jammed and the internet speed gets slower. This phenomenon is called micro-cuts (Web pages / Videos can't fully load)

Second fact : Network saturation, generally it's hard/impossible to get a good internet connexion in crowded places which has many internet subscribers. Sadly, Tunisie Telecom knows about that but can't figure out a great solution  to this issue because the network itself isn't evolutive and can't handle this growth and (of course) they don't want to pay for a new installation.

Third reason, ISPs : Well it depends from the location too. In my area, Globalnet are the best.

So long story short, internet works perfectly in enterprise / fancy zones like northern suburbs in Tunis (major access networks uses fiber there) but in most rural/popular places it sucks hard (old/bad networks)

I know what you're dealing with man, I had this issue before and I switched to mobile 3G for a time .Try to call your ISP and complain about it. They will call Tunisie Telecom to check the line's signal and try to fix it. If the problem is still there, terminate your contract and switch to another ISP.

If you're going to visit the desert or cities that are away from the regular tourists stuff, don't show too much skin... A t-shirt is fine, but your GF shouldn't be walking around in a bikini top. Also, kissing and holding hands in public outside of tourists areas may not be well received by some.

cpjhvp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/2zj00b/,4,"First, congratulations!  As an American now married to a Tunisian woman, I gotta say I approve =).

1.) I'm not aware of any customs or traditions but have heard that typical Tunisian women date to get married.  Even some of the more progressive ones.  My wife dated 1 guy for 2 months before me.  Her sister dated a few guys very quickly before finally dating one for a year and married him.  Since it is conservative, public displays of affection are rare here.  They happen but not typical.  I'm married and we still rarely do much more than holding hands in public.  We will sit close to each other and kinda be flirty and such but no kissing or anything like that.

2.) I think for this, let her dictate the trip.  I mean, she has the home court advantage right?  One place I'd highly recommend is the ruins of Carthage.  Absolutely beautiful scenery there and you will learn a lot.

3.) If you buy stuff from street vendors like collectibles or really anything, negotiate prices.  It's pretty much a national sport here to haggle over prices.  Also, be aware, they may say ""Oh want to take a picture with a monkey? 2 Dinar"" then you snap a few pictures ""Oh that's 10 dinar"".  So, be careful about that.

Try the local cuisine as much as you can.  A lot of it is spicy as all damnation but it's delicious.  If you meet her parents, she has intentions =)  Another place to check out is Sidi Bou Said.  If you're over that way there is a place called Cooks that has some great food.  It's not Tunisian but still good.  

Prepare for wind.  Seriously, I live in lac 2 and this place has wind like I've never seen.  I've seen stronger winds (I grew up in Hurricane territory in the US) but day in and day out it's just... wind.  Strong winds.  If it's raining, typically, just wait 5 minutes and there will be sun.  But do whatever you need to do because in 5 minutes that could change again.

Due to recent events, be vigilant about your surroundings and let your embassy know where you will be staying and register with them for email alerts and phone numbers.  If up for a double date with some other Redditors, let me know.

cti2z1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/3er3yd/,4,"A few elements to take into consideration:

* In Tunisia, as in many places around the world, there's a good proportion of people who see and hate the way some countries police the world. These people would very much like to change that. Some opted for ideologies like communism or nationalism to help stick it to the imperialist oppressors.

* After the Iranian Islamic revolution, some Tunisians came to the conclusion that Islam can in fact be a way to fight western hegemony and repeated humiliations.

* The Ben Ali and Bourguiba regimes fought the spread of Islamist ideologies as they constituted a political threat. They fought the teachings of the Maliki school of Islamic thought which for centuries was the main religious sect. Pushing it out of the scene meant that people had to find somewhere else to get their religious ideals.

* Golf countries put ridiculous amounts of money into spreading their view of Sunni Islam: As-Salafiyyah, AKA Al-Wahhabiyya by its detractors. Their main way of spreading it being the satellite channels which where hard to censor. This started during the Ben Ali regime.

* Come the revolution, people thought they are now free to practice their religion. During the Ben Ali regime everyone remotely religious was a suspect. I'm talking they find a Qur'an at your house you're screwed. Head scarves where prohibited, beards were too etc. You could get arrested if you go to the mosque too much.

* A new idea was starting to take root. Why not create an Islamic state with real Sharia as its constitution and law. This wasn't going to happen in Tunisia. The constituent assembly drafted a civil constitution which wasn't good enough for those who want to create the Islamic state AKA the Khilafa.

* Meanwhile the war rages on in Syria. And it started to take deeper, more sectarian aspects to it. There's one thing that the Salafiyya hate more than the oppressors: the Shias. And with the correct indoctrination, the blood of sunnis in far away Tunisia could be made to boil in rage.

* Unemployment and corruption made many young men lose any hope in Tunisia. They are better dead in the fighting than alive here.

* Also worth mentioning: most young people whom I've known and who had radical thought weren't even religious before the revolution. Quite the opposite actually. [This guy](https://www.facebook.com/emino.0fficiel) was actually a rapper before leaving for Syria a few months ago. 

* Also, ISIS has many engineers or engineering students in its ranks. These people are generally the more religious students in my country.

* Final point (I don't know if this is a factor): ISIS pays well.

TL;DR: Old regime doesn't allow you to practice religion, doesn't let people teach you religion, you find extremists on TV who teach you religion, you are poor and jobless which makes you lose all hope of your country, you hate the western oppressors who humiliate you, recruiters keep talking to you about the glorious days of the Islamic Khilafa when Muslims were never humilated, you decide to go ( and maybe get paid handsomely).

If you're going to live in an isolated village, you should rent a car as soon as you land and bring a GPS with you. There are three types of villages in Tounes: fishing, agricultural and ""desert"" villages. They have one thing in common, which is the lack of young men and women. They usually spend most of their time in the city where they study or work. This is very important because you are going to be surrounded by the elderly. These people only communicate in the regional dialect and are very conservative. My advice to you is to stay close to the cities and not spend a long time in the same place. It is a culturally rich country and there is a lot to discover. I can't recommend any Arabic phrases because the dialects are different depending on the region.

cwbb3uw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/3pz2hk/,3,"&gt; you got me there how do i start ?

Set a precise goal and work hard for it, don't be like 

&gt;i wanna start making $1000 right now because it's cool B|

It doesn't work like that, at least for me lol. 

In my case, making games was the only thing i wanted to do, 10 years ago, learning how to create games was just a hobby and of course when you are under 18 years old you have no worries about money at all, so i consider myself lucky that i was able to learn all the basics in an early age, after finishing high school (el-bac) my first year in college was a pure shit, actually my first 2 weeks, it was pure nonsense they are just ""teaching"" us useless stuff so i quite (année blanche) of course my parent were totally against it but i knew that i can't do anything with a degree of that level, so i set a goal that year to be able to find a job withing my field of expertise : programming, i wasn't aiming for a game developer job at all, so i started searching on what tools/language i needed to learn, and as someone who never did Object Oriented Programming before, the Internet ""told me"" to start with Java, and i did, i learned the basics then again, all i want to do is games so i picked a java framework specified in video games (libGDX) after having an intermediate level with that tool i managed to get my first job, it wasn't a game and it was ultra cheap too, it was for someone who own an ""auto-ecole"" in my city (Bizerte) he was a family member and he wanted a software to manage his client database, i did it for 150dt lol. then i went back looking online and after a year (""next"" September) i managed to get a job from Odesk.com (today is named Upwork.com) as an android game developer, it was also very cheap ($200) and that's it, since then i start learning new tools (Unity3D, Cocos2D-x, phaser, Blender, photoshop, etc..) and i kept doing ""[shitty games](http://aladineprojects.tumblr.com/)"" for low price, but it was low internationally, however in Tunisia it allowed me to live like a boss xD 
After 3 years of hard work i finally published my [first game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.juiceGlobal.grappleRun) with a real publisher, which is been in the store for the past 2 weeks and it's making me an average daily income of $xx/day *(shit i forgot i can't share the revenue lol)* and it will increase because am going to add [more levels and features](http://imgur.com/a/bOW7H) in the next update. 

Long story short, if you are dedicated enough to do what you want, then it will happen. what i said might look easy but imagine spending an entire year at home, zero-money, your family looking down at you cause you quit college and you are now ""battal"", they have **no idea** about video games so you can never convince them, the majority of your friends are trolling and being the : 

&gt;""you made a game, so what :v ?? ""

If you can manage to fuck all that and do what you want to do, then you will, but if you prefer the lazy life then your rewards will be even more lazy ;) 

and btw, after the fist year i went back to college lol (cause mom -_- )  and i passed (duh..) then in the second year (2emme System embarqué) i had many good job offers that i couldn't refuse, which affected my education and i failed with [fucking 9.98 &gt;_&lt; !!](http://i.imgur.com/nXDriZY.png) but fuck'em, i ain't going back, am rolling alone now lol, but i did pay the subscribtion fees and i have my ""ch'hedet tarsim"" so i can change my ID to student (taléb) cause it's set to ""télmidh"" now. 
Anyway, Good luck if you are into programming :) and don't quit, cause as a programmer, your skill is **internationally wanted** you can find a job anywhere, just be good at what you're doing.


&gt;If you're into programming and have a good salary, why not start your own software company ?

Like i said in the other comment, i still don't see myself ""stable"" enough to have a ""company"", i'll do that when my passive income (games in the store, not contract job) reach $100k, only then i'll start thinking about a company, for now i'll just be a  [22 years old rich student from a medium family](http://i.imgur.com/6cVE4rk.gif)
xD 

Thanks bro 


**Ps :** 
about your brother, my brother is also unemployed (30 years old) he has a ""salle des jeux"" now, he had his degree 6 or 7 years ago from a "" centre de formation"" and he never worked in a ""real"" job but somehow in his ID he has ""employee in a company"" (mouwadhef bi sharika) he probably got it from one of his friends who has his own ""company"" (nothing big) so maybe your brother can do that ?

Also, customers here don't really understand how the modem works and whenever they have an issue with it (even small ones) they automatically head to their ISP to change it. And by that, ISPs changed their return policy and became more severe.

Actually you can change your modem for free. Just don't bother going to your local agency because they won't understand you sadly (they automatically assume that your modem works fine if they see the power &amp; wifi leds are green).Try to head directly to their HQ, explain them your issue and you'll get a new one (I've done this twice).

crja4mk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/36cvxb/,2,"Hey!  I'm an American currently living here and some things to do/don't do.  Some are already covered:

Holding hands or sitting close to each other at a table is perfectly fine.  Don't be overly affectionate though.  Kissing in public isn't done much here either.  I think you could do it and no one would say anything but the locals don't do it.

I'm not sure what part of Tunisia you're going to be in but I'm assuming Tunis.  Make sure to go to the pier in Lac 1 and Lac 2 (Lac 1 has more things like bowling and amusement park rides and such as Lac 2 is just now still being built up).  I'd try some of the cafes.  Golden Cafe in Lac 2 is good as well as the new Omega Cafe, also in Lac 2.  Cooks in Sidi Bou Said is freakin' amazing.  Sidi Bou Said itself is pretty nice too.  Lots of blue and boats and all that so if you're up for walking, it's gorgeous.

I'm not sure if you're into geocaching but if you are, try to find some geocaches and they will help you pick some destinations that most likely have some great cultural or scenic things to view.  

Go see the Ruins of Carthage.  There is a tour guide there that speaks French, English, I think German, Arabic, and Tunisian.  She does charge but she's great.  Her English leaves a little to be desired and you may need her to slow down a little to understand her.  She gets really excited about the history so she may talk quickly.  She will tell you a LOT of stuff and though the ruins aren't very large, It'll be about an hour just having her showing you around and explaining things.

If you see street vendors (Not stores, but just random makeshift places selling stuff), haggle with them.  Don't try to get away with a steal but most will be willing to go a little lower in prices and maybe throw in a few things for the money.  

If you're from the US (doubtful but, possible lol) let me know when you're here.  Would be great to meet you.  Don't get a lot of Americans here so I miss them.  Also, there is a place here, not sure if you want to visit it, called The Family Place.  They have a special breakfast on the first sunday of every month.  It's an all American breakfast with some really great food.  I look forward to it every month now as everyone speaks English (most people who run it are Americans) and makes me a little less home sick =)

I'm not sure how fit you are but Lac 1 and Lac 2 are connected via a boardwalk.  It's REALLY really long.  If you're up for a really long walk, it's great to be on the sea side and see a lot of people and things.  Lots of great restaurants up and down the boardwalk too in both Lac 1 and 2.

If you want to visit other places like Bezert or Sousse /u/Enti_San can probably give you more information than I can on what to see/do when visiting.

Oh, also, don't go to the southern region of the country.  Also, register with your embassy while here for any sort of emails or warnings and all that noise.",2015-05-24 13:03:29

I have been here since July 25th last year and let me tell you, you're in for a treat.  When I first arrived I felt like a fish out of water.  Hell, I felt like a monkey in a fish tank that's how out of place I was.  Fast forward to nearly a year later and I fucking LOVE it here.  I miss the US, don't get me wrong.  But when I think about it what I miss are my family and friends the most, that's it.  I've tried very hard to acclimate myself to the culture and traditions here and it's been a great thing.  I now go to cafes at midnight and smoke Chicha (spelling may be wrong, it's Hookah).  I talk to people as best as I can.  My wife, thankfully, has helped me by making some cards so I can go to the store, her work, a pharmacy, or the hospital pretty easily just by handing them a card.  I've picked up some Arabic, Tunisian, and French with my stay here.

Have you friend teach you a few things.  Get used to life on a tougher difficulty mode though.  In the US you can live without leaving your house, ever.  Not so here.  Where as you can have groceries, food, amazon, whatever, deliver stuff to your house it's not as rampant here.  You can have food but no amazon, no shipping from websites generally, you gotta go to Carrefour, Geant, or Monoprix to get actual food.

Also, if you find something you like food wise, don't get attached.  It may be gone soon and never to return, or it could be restocked tomorrow, or next week, you just never know.  If you drink soda, Coke Zero is ""Coca Zero"" here.  Learn to use clear hand signals.  With my broken French/Arabic/Tunisian and some peoples broken English, I can carry on a pretty good conversation with someone.

My mother is from Bizerte so i usually go there a lot. I'm going to be 100% honest with you. The people are fantastic and friendly but the place itself isn't that great. First of all, Bizerte is REALLY cold at winter and it Rains like hell most of the time, and since the infrastructure is really poor, the town starts floating within hours. 
For safety, Bizerte is really safe depending where you live, just like any other place in the world, if you step in the wrong neighborhood, you might get robbed or something. 
The people here are used to foreign people since it's one of the most touristic places in Tunisia thanks to its beaches and forests, so that shouldn't be a big of a deal. 

I'm not going to tell you whether to accept or not, but i'm going to tell you to do more researches and if you can find a better position in another country then i'd recommend that you go for the other one.  

PS: The internet in Tunisia in General is miserable, so if you're used to watching HD Youtube videos or skyping u might wanna check that off the list. 

Overall: Tunisia isn't like Syria or Lybia or Iraq, its really safe and the community is friendly and you won't be in any form of Risk, with that being said i wish you luck and a good stay in any country you choose.

&gt; When you showed them the money did their view change? 

Of course xD but also am trying to get my mom to understand that video games are not just some casual waste of time entertainment tool, i made her watch me play [The last of Us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQpdSVF_k_w) and [the walking dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj5Y3jGf-CI) i really hope that in the next few years i'll be able to make bigger games with stories and real messages in them so i can finally contact the local media and make them talk about this field, videogames should be treated exactly like movies, theater and Tv series. in fact, from a business perspective, the goverment should give more attention to it because making money in this field is **[way more profitable](https://www.quora.com/Who-makes-more-money-Hollywood-or-the-video-game-industry)** than the ""movie-family""

&gt;The video game industry made twice as much money in 2013 than did the film industry.

&gt;Worldwide box-office revenue for the film industry in 2013 was $35.9 billion 

&gt;Worldwide revenue for the video game industry in 2013 was $70.4 billion 


I still don't understand why the government is not looking seriously to this business, it just need human-skills and a decent Computer (~1500dt) to make a good game, anyway, i'll try to have a good influence about this in the future, for now, am busy taking care of my future =p 

&gt;you must have pissed the wrong ""gods""...

LOL! you have no idea :3 

**edit**  

i forgot to answer this : 

&gt; Also since you're still young did you consider studying abroad?

I honestly completely let go the idea of studying just to have a degree then be stack in an office forever, plus the field that i chose (video games) is easily accessible online if you know where to look, i consider myself lucky now because i earn all my money from outside the country so i can either transfer it to my Tunisian bank account (and get it locked here forever xD) or keep it online and buy whatever i want with it, i have a premium subscription in [CGCookie](https://cgcookie.com/) (*am working on achieving a good level in 3D modeling and animation *) so for me, education is just learning, it doesn't have to be in a college or a learning institute, [i simply don't need that kind of education ;) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrxX9TBj2zY) ",2015-10-24 20:29:00

I speak very little French at least but I'm starting to learn and pick stuff up and actually found a site that is great and has things phonetically spelled out since I'm hard of hearing and can't pick up some of the nuances of words sometimes.  My wife is Tunisian however and it helps.

Also, a good portion of people here (especially in the mid to upper scale areas) speak English.  My wife, her brother, sister, mother, father and most of her relatives all speak it and they come from what most would consider upper lower class as far as income levels.

The cultural differences that I found most shocking is stuff being ""out of season"".  Something foreign to me in the US.  However, the food tastes  SO much better and fresher because the stuff grown here travels VERY little distance to get to the stores.  You also have lots of open area markets where people just grew them and sell the stuff on the sides of the roads.

One that still irks me a bit is that people litter here.  A lot.  I live in a pretty upper class area surrounded by high scale cafe's and hotels and embassies EVERY where and trash in the streets is just a thing.  I've seen countless people just dispose of a water bottle or bag of chips by just letting it drop; no shame.

My wifes father says the people here aren't very nice however I've been greeted with an overwhelming positive response.  It reminds me of NYC a bit in that people generally won't say ""Hello"" like I'm used to in the southern US (which I was born and raised) just walking by you.  People tend to just move along and not pay attention to you.  At least in the big city of Tunis.  In Sousse where my Wife is from and we visit a lot, people are so very friendly and get a good chuckle at my broken Arabic but not in a condescending way.  A lot of people here really try to use English if they know you speak it Native just to ""stretch their legs"" so to speak.

At the moment i don't have any energy to think about a place, but La Medina would sound like a good idea since it's one of the best places to be in during Ramadan.

Section 3. [**The Flat Stanley Project**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Stanley#The_Flat_Stanley_Project) of article  [**Flat Stanley**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat%20Stanley): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;The Flat Stanley Project was started in 1995 by Dale Hubert, a third grade schoolteacher in [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London,_Ontario), [Ontario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario), Canada. It is meant to facilitate letter-writing by schoolchildren to each other as they document where Flat Stanley has accompanied them. Dale Hubert received the [Prime Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada)'s Award for Teaching Excellence in 2001 for the Flat Stanley Project.

&gt;The Project provides an opportunity for students to make connections with students of other member schools who have signed up with the project. Students begin by reading the book and becoming acquainted with the story. They create paper ""Flat Stanleys"" (representative drawings of the Stanley Lambchop character) and keep a [journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diary) for a few days, documenting the places and activities in which Flat Stanley is involved. Each student's Flat Stanley and its respective journal are mailed to other people who are asked to treat the figure as a visiting guest and add to his journal, then return them both after a period of time. The project has many similarities to the [travelling gnome prank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_gnome_prank) except, of course, for the Flat Stanley Project's focus on literacy.

&gt;Students may find it fun to plot Flat Stanley's travels on maps and share the contents of the journal. Often, a Flat Stanley returns with a photo or postcard from his visit. Some teachers prefer to use [e-mail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mail) for its quicker travel time.

The revolution hasn't necessarily solved their problems and that frustration with the entire system is building. ISIS has a powerful message that legitimately sells in conditions like these. It isn't just meant to appeal to the poor and uneducated masses, and not everyone who joins ISIS is stupid. ISIS is attracting economists, engineers, writers, cosmopolites, statesmen; you can see it in the sophistication of their ""state"" apparatuses.  
  
Tunisians aren't going to be impervious to the ISIS message just because of education - there needs to be legitimately believable alternatives, with actual progress and not just the illusion of it, in which they can invest their idealism. If anything, education makes Tunisians harder to fool in this regard - they can't just be pumped full of propaganda telling them that the state is forging a perfect path towards a better future, unlike the Egyptians.",2015-06-30 04:46:30

It sounds like I'll just miss my family.

csnl2ob,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/3bhmvh/,1,"I've not seen a single squat toilet.  All bathrooms I've seen have toilet paper and if not, you can ask for some.  They all have the hose thing but I'm not for that.  One thing I would suggest is carry a backpack if you go to a cafe or something like that and grab some baby wipes.  The toilet paper here, in general, leaves a lot to be desired and I get better results with the wipes.

You'll still find some mega products here.  Most of it is snack foods though like Cheetos, Bugles, Coke, you can find Pepsi in some places but not 100% of the time.  Also, it's not just seasonal foods that disappear.  Sometimes it's water you may prefer (Always buy bottled water.  Out of the spigot tastes like pool water.  Okay to cook with but has a strong chlorine taste) or crackers or even hamburger or fish or something along those lines.

Oh, also with bathrooms, I've found that most are REALLY tiny.  I've been in probably 8 or 9 and only 1 has been of a good size.  You got enough room for a toilet, for you to stand, and a sink immediately behind you.  Just make sure the first month or so you go out to cafes or whatever you go with your friend.  There are some things that may be new to you.  You'll be asked by people selling flowers if you want to buy some.  Up to you if you want to buy some.  I think they smell good but I don't always buy them.  Also, nothing is free in cafes.  If you ask for cards, you get charged and you don't get to keep the cards (I found this out recently &gt;.&gt;), tipping is minimal.  You can leave just a couple dinar (which is about $1) and that's good.  You'll notice that some things are EXTREMELY cheap here.  I can buy a 20oz Coke Zero, a bag of chips and some fresh, still hot bread, and a can of tuna for about $3.50 USD.  Makes for a great lunch btw.",2015-06-30 15:07:29

For example, I stayed in hotels for about 5.5 months out of 7 that I was in the US, last year.  I joined a rewards program before doing this and earned a lot of points.  I am hoping to go back to the US soon and looked up if I had enough points to cash in for miles.  I have enough for one way but I checked to see how much points are (you can buy points instead of earning them)

30,000 points gets you 6000 miles.  However, you can buy 5000 points for $55.  So, if you do the math of 6 * $55, that's $330 USD for one way, double that to $660 for a round trip.  Not sure where you guys are though.  If in the US, it's a little tougher as you'd need to probably book through a couple airlines this way.

Also, check with your embassy in the country she is in.  I know that the US Embassy here in Tunisia will give you a loan to get back home.  The downside is that it's a one way ticket and you have to pay the loan back to leave the US again (They freeze your passport).  But, that gets here there to see your relative in time.

sure it did helped slightly in some cases,we don't have the investigation media .
 but always the media will try to distract people with bullshit. politicians have the media in their poket so chanel 1 is for the party A and chanel 2 is for the party 2. people now are tired and they just gave up. especially when a movement called ""winou l petrol""=""where is the petrol"" and some strikes and people were in to it and the goal was to clarify the oil folder in the country ,and the contracts that are signed with other countries to explore and usage of our oil even media started to talk about it and you can tell that the people in charge are confused and their facts are shady and weak and all the sudden Sousse terrorist attack came and british peeps died so the goverment can make ""the emergency law"" all over the country, it means no strikes no protests no nothing . and ""we all unified to fight terrorism"" .

The Television and media in General has drastically changed before and after the Revolutions.

Before the revolutions: Channels were forced to praise the president on every single thing he does and show him as the great democratic, loving, caring, wise, trust worthy leader and anyone who was against that was immediately arrested and thrown in jail, Youtube was blocked since it contained some videos that were against he president, and many artists like rappers and singers were arrested for releasing revolution-provoking Music, and journalists were watched 24/7 on everything they write or report to see if it has anything against the president. And in the protest period, they tried to convince the people that they were doing the wrong thing and the president gave several speeches that failed to control the angry mob. 

After: People are now more liberated and the cuffs are finally removed from the Media, freedom of speech and Media is finally being applied and we can finally bash anyone we like (And we're enjoying it way too much lol). Many political debates are broadcaster almost everyday which unlike the pre-revolution years where people knew nothing about politics and the old president used to win the elections with 99% voting.

Life is busy at the moment for /u/Enti_San and myself but just know that some things are in the works and being planned.

Some of the difficulties we are facing right now is there is mostly a young group of people here and students at that and it makes it a little prohibitive to do much as Tunis is pretty big and that's probably where most everyone is.  

So we're having difficulties in trying to find a place that is close enough to not be too expensive or hard to get to but would be fun, cheap, and at a time everyone could do it.  I'm looking to get some board games sent from the US soon from my Dad (hopefully) and those could be fun and free.

Just check in every couple weeks for an announcement starting in January.  I always like to plan them ahead a couple weeks before hand.  We may do a smaller get together sooner.  I like to just go out and smoke shisha and it's cheap (5 TND).  Maybe others could be interested.",2015-12-16 02:41:57

They have pomme, raisin, another flavor I don't recall.  Plus some others they didn't name as I stopped them at pomme as that's what I typically get.

Omega sucked too.  I would get pomme and it just was... bad.  The hoses didn't seem clean enough and I went to write a review and others complained about the same thing.
