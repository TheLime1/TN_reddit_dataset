d21avls,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/4em7bk/,9,"Welcome!

depends where you are staying first. The weather is getting amazing, summer time! Try to Visit Carthage historical sites, it's beautiful. Also, the Medina (the old city downtown), be careful there cause if you look ""white/blond tourist"" they gonna try to sell you everything, with huge prices, it's more cultural to discuss the prices here (like in Italy too), no price tags in most shops, especially for traditional handmade products, but the old city is amazing, go to EL ALI restaurant, and have food in the outdoor tables, it's wonderful. Visit the mosques there, say you are converting to islam (so you can get there) and never be scared, be curious cause people are kind on average. Cabs are cheap (thanks to the currency rates). Sidi Bou Said is an incredible costal village built on hills next to the sea, it looks like in the greek islands (all blue and white) with amazing sightseeings. There's a tradition coffee there to taste it is called turkish coffee, strong and flavored with rose essence. If you are lucky enough, you can swim in Gammarth. check for a good hotel and use the swimming pool if you don't like the sea. Go to Marsa and Gammarth for nightlife and drinks. I am kinda free from the 14th to the 18th. Let me know if you need some help :)
Plan your trip in 4 days, there's a lot to see and try!

d5ixcxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/4tmoj1/,9,"&gt; do you think it's a sickness as most Tunisian people say

No it's not, only competent people have the right to classify a behavior as an illness or not, even doctors are not allowed to do so, only scientists and ""real"" researchers, and of course you can't be a religious scientists (Definetly not a Muslim) , so no, it's super dumb to put all your faith and trust in the hand of the people who create drugs &amp; vaccines for all of us, but when the same people say that homosexuality is not a disease some ignorants just jump out of their seats and suddenly they all become scientists and give themselves the right to ""discover"" a new disease. 

&gt; Why it seems that they are more now?

exactly, it **seems** , it's just because of the big media change all over the world, but for Tunisia in particular, just think about the number of people using Facebook ~8years ago , same thing go for Tv/Radios. 

The number is probably the same, they are just having much coverage now, also there is the impact of what's going on in the world in general, you know in the early 2000s (and all the years before) being homophobic was the cool thing to do, but as you may know that changed **A LOT** lately, which is another reason that may encourage a lot of Tunisians to ""come out""


&gt; And If you are a Muslim and you find out that it's not a sickness, what'll be your opinion? 

LOL! seriously bro ? Islam is a faith, faith require blind trust ...[cough] stupidity [cough]... 

Their opinion wont change, will never change, just like all the scientific discoveries that contradict with every religion on earth didn't change their opinion, just like [the old false version of the Stages of the creation of the embryo in the Quraan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQXjyuxpNdE) didn't change their opinion. 

**AT BEST** they will tell you this is an Israeli propagnda trying to spread corruption and shit in order to destroy Islam

first of all it is an identity crysis, almost all teenagers are brainwashed into thinking that their country is so trash and that they should go live elsewhere, that is due to the lack of a rewarding education system that have provides a rentable and a worthful working opportunities which in turn is caused by years of corruptions and dictatorship led by the old RCD goverment and Ben Ali's regime.. Keep in mind that our country relies on it's brains to provide income because of the lack of natural and strategic economical resources..  
  
Second Religious and social complications, again this is a consequence of the identity crysis we're actively trying to live like the western world while at the same time having different background ideologies and traditions which created an impressive hypocrisy levels..  
Moreover we have horrible politicians, we've a president with a brain capacity of a goldenfish and lack of political will and decisive stances..   
All these dissapointing figures causes increasing levels of depression in the middle of the educated class which by the way is contuniously decaying especially on the female's side, typically having cultural desertification, our girls are 24/7 posing in the front of the camera and chit chatting on facebook which caused in it is own the apparition of new species what we call (la7asa) and that sir is one of the most catastrophical destructive and fatal diseases and it has already spread across the country, cure is nowhere to be found..

* Always carry cash with you. Most local shops/stores do not accept Credit Cards. (AFAIK)

* If you're planning to go somewhere/do something, I'd recommend you do it during daylight.

Between all these, people vary and swing. Some financial and societal factors may interfere too. A poor religious guy can become quickly dangerous or aggressive towards a westernized city like Tunis. A rich westernized guy can express hate and superiority towards the second group.
Hopefully some are more balanced and are just trying to be nice to everyone which is the core of the islam regardless of the surrounding and the daily money struggle.

1. An apartment in Carthage (Salambo/Byrsa) would cost approx. between US $200-$500 (Prices may increase in the summer).

2. Most Tunisians understand and can speak Foos'ha, and you will be able to understand Tunisian dialect since they are almost the same, so communication is not an issue.

3. The capital has a well-developed light rail system. Adding to that, bus stations are almost everywhere. You can get to most of places. Sahel area (Monastir, Sousse, and Mahdia) has a similar light rail system. Just be careful of pickpockets.

4. Calling cards are actually prepaid phone cards. You recharge your phone and you get credits to call/text/browse the internet. Phone companies in Tunisia has a BYOP policy, so you probably need to unlock your phone before moving there. Adding to that, Phone rates are very cheap. ($0.06 for local calls, ~$0.4 for international calls) Plus, you can get tons of bonuses (For instance, you get 1 GB for free when you consume 10 TND). PLUS Local phone companies will launch 4G in the summer.

5. Expenses may vary. Carthage is considered an upper class area, so you may expect to pay more for services (food, beverages, groceries..). Taxes are included in prices. You can tip but it is not mandatory.

6. There are many public beaches in that area. 

**Tips:**

* Local people are very friendly and welcoming.

* Always carry your ID with you.

* Always carry cash with you. Most local shops/stores do not accept Credit Cards. (AFAIK)

* If you're planning to go somewhere/do something, I'd recommend you do it during daylight.

Because Tunis is a busy city, you rarely get a chance to stop and chat with the locals, but if you do, try to avoid religious subjects. I did have a few religious and political discussions with the people I met on my travels there, but we were already friendly enough to talk on heated topics without starting an arguement or being rude.

There are more formal academic Arabic transcription systems (a lot of them) that are used in books and newspaper articles and the like, but in the internet age this is the most common way that friends write to each other in Latin characters (it's often used to write colloquial Arabic, rather than Modern Standard Arabic). It was apparently developed pretty spontaneously for mobile phones before Arabic keyboards became common on smart phones, but is still used for easy of transcription. 2 is hamza, 7 is ha, 3 is ayin, etc. All the letters are used because they sound the same sin makes an s sound, so s is used. The numbers are used like this not because 2 *sounds* like the anything particular, but the glyph for 2 *looks* a little bit like hamza, ayin looks like a backwards three (but also Arabic is written right to left while this chat alphabet is written left to right, so the mirroring makes more sense). Similarly, in Arabic dots above letters can change sounds. This is done in the chat alphabet with an apostrophe--3 and 3' are different letters. It's really neat

It should be easier for foreign businesses to setup business here.  It's up to the government to create jobs and there are so many that can be created.  One of the things that helped the US was road construction and if there's one thing this country could use, is road construction and repair.

An across the board wage increase would also help.  By creating jobs and increasing wages, you're increasing taxes collected which can then, in turn, be put back into creating more jobs.  I don't think the solution is sitting and waiting for funding from France, US, or other countries to help stimulate the economic growth of the country.

The money coming in could help create those initial jobs and even put a safety net program in place to help those less fortunate.

i think that no one can affirm that it is a sickness. The ""religious/ignorant"" ones are stubborn, don't even argue with them, you lose time. The other part are the World Health Organization funs. They claim that in 73 it was taken out of the mental disease book of diagnosis. If you investigate, you will find out that in the ""world wide organization"" the mental diseases are listed in groups by a system of votes. which is not very scientific!
I am a muslim and I know that faith is only thing that rewards you with the heaven in the afterlife. Most of the scholars of islam in the last 1400 years almost agree that a gay person is not a faithless person. they say it is a sin and God punished Loth people for the same bad actions. But God also punished those who cheated their brothers for money, those who banned their brother to get the water that God sent and that they kept for themselves. So ""we"" are all sinners with our greed, selfishness and egocentrism today. Focusing in the sexuality of the people is more as a frustration from males for example because they want to feel manly and they don't want to thing about the sodomy, when a lot of them practice sodomy with their wives which is a HUGE SIN in islam! (the prophet peace be upon him said once : the one who penetrate his wife during her period or from behind has rejected (kafara=rejecting the faith) the message of God i came with"".
Coming to the stupid argument of KSA, Iran and Pakistan today which affirms that gays should be put to death, it is an empty argument with no proofs from the Book or the Hadith of the prophet. Just to give a hint for those who wanna read about it: a guy called ibn taymiya (the mentor of the radicalization in the islamic world today) he said that 3 of the khalifa after the prophet agreed on the death penalty for gays but disagreed about the manner (sword, fire, push off a mountain) and he didn't recite any verse or hadith. The thing is all the ""historical events"" he is giving are ""weak"" and ""lies"", in the science he was using it is called a weak hadith meaning ""not a true saying of the prophet"". What I say to this scholar today is : if the 3 best friends of the prophet disagreed, it is a proof that they never witnessed or heard about the prophet applying such a penalty!! now ask KSA scholars what the fuck are they doing to these MUSLIM PEOPLE (muslims against the will of all the ignorant people outside)...

Blacks are not treated equally in Tunisia either. Most hate the idea of having a black person as a boss and some openly declare that blacks are only good for menial skill-less work. 

In the south, many places are still segregated. When I was staying in Gabes for a while I remember there was a neighborhood set aside for blacks where they've lived for decades very rarely being allowed into mainstream cultural exchange. 

The youth in Tunisia however are much more sensitive to things like this. So not everything is lost. I have hope for the future as there are many NGO's doing their best to help and the internet in general has done a great job in informing people of the world and its diversity. Hopefully that will be a driving factor in the ongoing cultural shift that this country needs so desperately.",2016-08-02 06:08:59

d7o7b9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/52xnyc/,3,"&gt; how hard was it for you to get started

To be honest it was pretty hard, and the reason is because of your last question, see after graduating high school i had high expectation on college education, after 2 months there i was incredibly chocked, the quality of teaching and level of information are **SO LOW** so i decided to drop, and so the first year in college (last half of the red area and the entire orange area) was super hard for me at home. 

I suddenly went from *the good college kid* to *the dropout loser who also happen to an atheist and metalhead so he must be worshiping the devil right?* 

So family support was *NULL* and am not only talking about moral stuff, financially i was fucked back then, they even decided to stop paying for my internet, so my learning ressource was about to get cut too, and i couldn't do anything to change their opinions specially that what i want to do is Game Development, so yeah, getting started was pretty tough but it is just of the environment i was put in, my girlfriend helped **A LOT** back then, and still doing a great job till now and i really own her a lot for the motivation boosts from time to time.

&gt; how hard is the paperwork ? 

What paperwork ? i didn't do any paperwork except opening a bank account until the last month i decided to start a company because i don't want the ""Student"" label on my ID anymore, and that is not hard at all, all you need is a minimum of 1000dt for your capital and +500dt for the lawyer, you can do some of his work by yourself but i didn't want to do any paperwork, it costed me 1000dt. 


**TL;DR** 

* It's always hard to get started, but persistance is key.

* You don't need any paperwork.

* I am a [Game developer](http://alaslipknot.tumblr.com/) with no college degree, because **FUCK THE SHIT OUT OF TUNISIAN EDUCATION**

d7pb0jy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/52xnyc/,3,"&gt; congrats bro you pulled yourself from the gutter, you should be proud of what you've accomplished.

Thanks mate! and yeah am a little bit proud xD

&gt; 1) whats your recourses 

It varies man, see the first period ""Learning "" how to learn""  "", that is real, when i started i was looking all over the internet, picking tutorials and courses that i may never need, or stuff that i didn't have the level to read, convincing myself that these tutorials are not for me and stoping the ""download every tutorial"" addiction was a tough thing to do (to discover to be precise). 

but to answer your question, here is the best places that worked very well for me in term of learning : 

* [Derek Banas Java Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7E8B7F4856C9B19) 

After dropping the shitty college on my first year, i knew for sure that Object Oriented Programming are a must have, i downloaded shitload of other tutorials and books, but this guy was the best.

* [java-gaming.org](http://www.java-gaming.org/)

Back then it was my favorite forum for everything related to java game programming.

* [official Unity Learning Section](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials)

At some point i decided to pick a better game engine that will save me a lot of time, and for me it was Unity. 
To reach the unity part a year has already passed and i am no longer in the ""learn ""how to learn"" "" phase, unity &amp; c# were my main working tools and i focused on them since 2013, and am still learning.

&gt; 1) ... and how much did it cost you ? 

**ZERO** didn't pay shit everything was free on the internet, i do remember downloading premium tutorials from Torrents, but i swear, i **NEVER** finished any of them and i don't ever remember any of these tutorials was useful for me, the only help they did is making me realize that collecting more than 100 tutorial series wont make me any better and that free ressources on the internet are everything that a beginner will ever need.

&gt; 2) on average how many hours did you spend learning per day ?

**A LOT** if you read [my previous comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/52xnyc/my_monthly_income_since_i_decided_to_start/d7o7b9t) here you'll probably understand the situation i was in. 

It was literally make it work or die, in the house i was the one who spend the whole day in his room playing or chasing girls on facebook, but that ain't true xD 
i wasn't playing nor facebooking, i was learning, since i wake up until i sleep i always had something to code, sure i take pauses and whatnot, but in the first 2 years (2012 &amp; 2013) i am confident to say that i spend at least 10 hours a day doing something productive. 

&gt; 3) how long did it took you before you could get work,

23 months if you consider the learning phase (you can see that in the images)
but If you don't, say you are able to create commercial product in whatever field you picked, you can say that it took me ~3months, after becoming confindent in my unity skills, i started making short games prototype for fun, after 2 months i start looking for jobs and i found my first job a month or so later.

&gt; 3) ... and which is your preferred freelance website ?

When i started it was oDesk.com (now its called [upwork.com](https://www.upwork.com/) ) but i only got my 2 first jobs from there, the first long term job was from GameJam (ludumDare), then the current job that am doing i didn't even look for it xD the client found [my blog](http://alaslipknot.tumblr.com/) In May 2015, we stayed in contact and then we started working together since September 2015.

dbqgrr3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/5ko2am/,3,"let me analyse this documentary for you  
the part about the referee, saying there is only one black referee is true, not because they aren't accepting black referees but because there is so few black people so from these few chances of getting a black referee is so low, the part were there were some kids racially abusing him is true, why no actions are taken? because here we insult and make fun of people alot, even if you were white or brune they would call you something and insult you, it is not targeted to black people only, I understand that the referee felt bad for it and that these kids should be punished but I assure you that the tunisian people don't accept racism the proof is recently a tunisian student attacked two africain female students with a knife, media talked about it and all students demonstrated and asked for punishement and denounced the action.  
The second part is where the woman talked about disorting her picture, this woman is a politician she was targeted by her haters and one of them happened to be a lawyer who got penalised for it..  
the part that there are some cafees that employs only black people to make em look like slaves is a lie. as a cofee owner you are free to hire whoever you want, you're not forced to work as a server in a coffee besides the majorit of the workers are not black so the argument is not legit..  
the rapper i don't know him but he read a message where someone insulted him on facebook! come fucking on it is the internet it is only normal for an internet troll standing behind the monitor to insult you moreover the crowd's favourite rapper is klay bbj and he is brune I'm sure that he gets these kind of comments on his page but this rapper is using this to get fame..  
I could go on to the case of the wife who got hit by a rock, this happens alot in Tunisia the son was from the military and they let him go, this is not because of racism but because of corruption and things like these happens alot not only against black people..  
The bus thing is a lie you see brune and black pupil coming out of the bus not because there is seperation but because the population in south tunisia is black and brune and there are soooooo few white people...  
these are just anomaies though I don't deny that there are racist people and racists behaviour but that happens in all countries in the world.

Granted these grants are never mentioned in the media but, usually, student committees in every university guide the students. So yeah, it is safe to say that Tunisians have an easy access to education.

Back in 2011, before the revolution, there was a ton of unemployment (over 15%) and a lot of young people coming out of college couldn't get jobs.  Unemployment for a young person out of college was over 30%.  The revolutions came because they were tired of the corruption going on with no jobs being created and actual restrictions in place prohibiting jobs from being created and not allowing young people to go abroad to find work.

The revolution happened, they got a new President, some shit went ona nd they got a new President with promises of employing more and more people.  Sadly, unemployment has still sat at 15% (15.1 instead of like 15.8 but, still) and unemployment for new graduates is still at 30%.  So the promises of new jobs never happened.  Little has changed, if anything at all and people are getting pissed off at the response of their government of ""Just give it some time and it will improve"" because waiting doesn't feed you or put clothes on your back.

People literally put bread out by the dumpsters for people who are poor.  Bread is government subsidized so that it remains cheap as hell here and you can see people digging through trash all the time for plastic water bottles to go recycle to get money.

d03nuz2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/448t2s/,2,"As grandiser12 mentioned, these 4 cities are safe to visit. There are many police checkpoints. Most Tunisians speak French but few of them speak coherent English (So if you're a bilingual Canadian, you can get along with locals). Local people are very friendly and welcoming. Most of the stuff in those areas are cheap. A coffee would cost $0.3-$1, and a sandwich $1-$3.

**My recommendations:**

* Always carry your passport with you.

* Get a local SIM card at the airport. It's only $2.5 and it normally has $30 worth of services. 

* During your road trip, Police/Army may ask to search the vehicle. Don't panic, it's a normal procedure.

* Always carry cash with you. Most local shops/stores do not accept Credit Cards. (AFAIK)

* If you're planning to go somewhere/do something, I'd recommend you do it during daylight.

* Many sellers will try to double charge you for cheap items. So be careful (Especially in Touristic zones)

* Don't forget to try Traditional Couscous, Lablebi, and Kafteji. These are very popular dishes in Tunisia!

* Have a safe trip!",2016-02-17 21:03:25

depends first if you are a man or a women, very important!
if you look ""western"" or not, very important too!
I always advise to get some western friends (expats like you mentioned), because the culture is very different from the west. Some behavior may sound rude and disrespectful when in reality it is not. Get a photocopy of your passport and NEVER go out with it, in case you lose it you will have to deal with your embassy (i know what it is believe me).
It is sad to say but you have to be careful every time it deals with money. In touristic areas everybody will try to trick you. My best advice is to always behave like you are a local, don't wear fancy clothes and act like a lost dude, try to be as tunisian as possible :)
Depends also on the city where you gonna live, Tunis is huge and it can be very fancy or very garbage. Nothing should surprise you, remember, you have to act as a local :)

Tunisia is a culturally rich country with variety of things to see. In the north you have to visit the capital Tunis (carthage, bardo musuem, the medina, ...). In the Central coast area you can visit El Jem (3rd biggest roman colisueum in the world). In south-west you can visit the oasis and the sahara desert. 
The western part of the country is rural and very pretty but some parts are not recommended as many counter terrorism ops are on from time to time.

How do you know that ? i think its far from being true. 

&gt; Do Tunisian francophones prefer to speak in French or in Arabic?

Tunisian Francophones ? you mean those who live in France ? if they can speak Tunisian then they will do, otherwise they will stick to their French

&gt; Which do young people like better?

It varies, only statistics can answer that, but i know for sure that a lot of the young people are leaning toward English, simply because there is WAY MORE english entairtenment contents compared to French. 

&gt; How would you say it's popularity has changed in Tunisian society?

Again i don't have correct numbers, but for me personally, it changed 
A LOT! from 5 years old until ~13 years old i really liked the french language (books, movies, tv shows, games etc..) and was very good at it in schook after that i started to get more into the American culture (Rock, Metal and Rap, Movies, Tv shows and of course games) so for the past 10 years i've been stepping everyday a step toward English that got me far from French, Also as a programmer and game developer i know for sure that having a very good English level is a MUST in order to advance. 

I also know that The French language worth almost nothing compared to the English language in all fields/countries (except Francophone countries ofc). 

I also know that studying science and technology in English is MUCH MORE accurate, easy and less boring than French. 

And finally, i find it a bit ironic that the country that colonized us and killed thousands of us is still having the benefits of picking the best minds in us just because we are studying all the important things in their language. 

But the same could be said about Arabic so i won't complain much about that.

If you go legit and get the proper business licenses it can be INCREDIBLY hard to get a business up and going.  Why?  Outside of all the red tape and hoops you jump through, you have to deal with Tunisian companies.  The worse, are the telcos here.  TT is absolutely the worse because if you get DSL, you have NO option but to deal with them.  So they can (and will) treat you however they want.

This is true of most monopolies here like STEG.  The way it works here, is you either A.) Bribe them to do it or B.) you keep on complaining until they get sick of you and do the work or just out and out ignore you.  And yes, billing they get to you on time every time.

I used to have fiber optic and was paying over 100dt a MONTH for internet and our modem was shit.  My wife went there to complain and their response was ""Um, okay?""  Then stared at her.  She asked for another modem ""Oh... no"".  She eventually went back a couple months later, bitched some more and got a new modem.  When it started doing the same thing ""Oh, well, that's just how it is.... bye"".

They don't care.  I actually had people lined up, just like you, paper work ready to file, backers ready to back and I was like ""you know what... nope"".  The sad thing is, a lot of Tunisians don't give a crap enough so i said to myself ""Why should I bother to help a country that has no desire to help itself"".  My wife and I are currently working on just going back to the US instead and leaving.

The infrastructure here (especially the internet) is horrid.  It's a bit better in Tunis but it's still bad.  My wife and I moved into a new building in October 2015.  We went November 2015 to get DSL ""Oh we haven't ran the lines to the building yet"".  It's a new building.  ""It'll be next month""  December?  ""Next month""  January? ""Next month""  February?

Sometimes bureacrats are lazy. Sometimes they are sleazy. Sometimes they are just plain incompetent. Whatever it is, I do not think you are properly ""trained"" to deal with them unless you've been raised here. 

I hope for your sake that you have a partner who is a Tunisian professional ready to fire up his vocal chords solo at the various administrations that have been paining you, as it sometimes is one of the only ways stuff can get done the way it needs to be done here.

Here are the student's questions, everything is completely optional. I understand that these questions may be identifying so please don't post anything you are uncomfortable with. I was trying to copy questions down as quickly as they could shout them out, so I did very little editing. I know that answers will vary greatly depending on the region of the country you live in, that's why we would like to talk to multiple people, so we can get a variety of viewpoints about your country.  

* What is your first name?  Is there a story behind what it means or where you got your name? 


* What languages are spoken in your country? Which are the most common?  When did you learn English?


* Do you celebrate Christmas in your country? If so, what is Christmas like? How do you celebrate?


* We have Canada Day, do you have a day to celebrate your country or its birthday? How do you celebrate it? 


* Do you play soccer in your country? What kinds of sports do kids play in your country? What games did you play at school when you were a kid?  Can you teach us one? 


* What does the traditional clothing look like in your country?  What kinds of clothes do you wear day to day? What are the popular fashions?


* Can you link us a popular (kid-appropriate) song you might hear on the radio in your country?  Preferably one that originates from your country.


* Can you tell us about one or two special celebrations in your country that we may not know about in Canada? 


* Can you share with us what school is/was like in your country?  


* How are birthdays celebrated in your country?  


* How do most people get around in your country? 


* What kinds of food do you like to eat? What are your favorite local dishes?


* Can you share some pictures of your city?  Schools?  Neighborhood?  Buildings? Food? Yourself? 


* How high do the grades go in your schools? 


* Are there special meals that you eat on holidays? We always have turkey on Thanksgiving.


* How tall is the tallest building in your city?  What is the name of the building? 


* What kinds of supplies do you have at your schools?


* What are your parks like? 


* Do you have Black Friday?  How do you celebrate it? 


* What do the houses look like in your neighborhood?


* What city do you live in?  What’s the name of your neighborhood? What does the name mean? 


* What kinds of pets/animals do people have in your city?  Can we see a picture of your pet?  What kinds of animals are in your country? 


* What kinds of jobs do people have in your area?  


* Are there any special celebrations in your area?  We have the Calgary Stampede every year here.


* What does your money look like?  Who is on it?  What’s on the back? Ours is mostly prime ministers.

That's right Tunisia IS a seasonal destination and tourism flourish at summer times. I do believe that we're growing though..  
on a daily life basis you can't expect a sudden rise in wages because Tunisia doesn't have oil like lybia or algeria or other arabian countries nevertheless there was a recent investement conference that showed promising plans to help the economical situation..  
Tunisia was never soft on criminals, quiet the opposite. The reason of somany jihadist being Tunisians is the instable situation in lybia which made smuggling (weapon and even humans) easier, you know in such cases the two countries should be cooperating on the borders but the lybian side isn't helping at all due to the general chaos and civil war.  Morocco on the other side is like in the other side of the world and so far from tension areas combine that with the harsh living conditions...  
Lybians living in Tunis, well lybians are so rich due to their oil.  
when they came to Tunisia somany problems appeared like market monopoly and higher costs of almost everything because they were buying everything. Not gonna lie I hate them for that, but I view them as brothers that are welcomed here for what their country is going through..  Border towns, some tension but nothing to worry about in danger times people were united side by side with the army(no fear lol) [as you can see here(there is one disturbing picture 1:03 AND 1:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwLgPnNHG-E)

czs615c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/44qqba/,1,"13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi—Michael Bay’s mythmaking - By Kevin Martinez 30 January 2016

Directed by Michael Bay; written by Chuck Hogan, based on a book by Mitchell Zuckoff

American film director Michael Bay is responsible for Bad Boys, Armageddon, Pearl Harbor, and the Transformers films. Not known for his subtlety, Bay’s approach is generally bombastic with as many explosions and special effects thrown in as technologically possible.

His latest film, 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi, about the 2012 attack on an American compound in Libya by Islamist militias that killed four Americans, including the US ambassador, is simply awful.

The casual reader may well ask, “So what did you expect?” And, “Why bother to review it?”

The point of the World Socialist Web Site arts review section is to critique official culture and examine wider trends in society, even if that means holding one’s nose on occasion and submitting to the worst of the commercial fare from Hollywood. Considering the trend of unabashed pro-American militarism in cinema in recent years (Zero Dark Thirty, Lone Survivor, American Sniper and more), it would be a mistake not to tell the truth about Bay’s 13 Hours.

Within the first few minutes of Bay’s film, the audience has already been lied to about the roots of the 2012 attack in Benghazi.

The filmmakers juxtapose the lynch-mob murder of Col. Muammar Gaddafi with titles that explain how the Libyan people rose up against an evil dictator and how the US and its allies fought to free the people, but then Islamist militias began fighting each other once the war was won…and so on.

In fact, after 2003, Washington was allied with Gaddafi and even used his country for CIA torture “black sites” to fight Islamist militias. After the Tunisian and Egyptian mass uprisings, the US government exploited popular hostility to the regime by arming these very same militias—now dubbed “freedom fighters”—to the teeth. Once Gaddafi was overthrown, in a war that saw NATO forces kill tens of thousands, the militias descended into tribal-based warfare, at one point creating two rival governments in Libya. Chaos and violence have ensued, treated for the most part in respectful silence by the media that previously howled about the danger of a “massacre” in Benghazi.

One of the most secular societies in the Middle East and North Africa has been torn apart by US imperialism with the aim of plundering the country’s oil and mineral wealth. In all likelihood, the CIA compound and “diplomatic outpost” in Benghazi was a major weapons conduit for smuggling arms and fighters into Syria to overthrow the Assad regime. Every indication suggests that the September 11, 2012, attack was a case of “blowback,” in which the US government reaped the whirlwind for courting (and arming) terrorists they once opposed.

None of this is remotely hinted at in 13 Hours. That would be a different and better kind of movie. Indeed, the Libyans in the film—if represented at all—are simply non-people. No motive is given as to why they would possibly hate the Americans. They are mowed down like weeds. Instead, the focus is on the “brave” Americans who defended the ambassador and State Department flunkies against the monstrous Arabs.

The characterizations in the film are minimal and threadbare. We meet Jack Da Silva (John Krasinski), who we learn is a CIA security contractor, a euphemism for mercenary, with a pretty wife and adorable children back home. From a McDonald’s drive-thru, with kids in tow, she tells her husband over the phone that she is expecting a baby. The scene, meant to be pull at our heartstrings, is so poorly directed that is actually comic.

The other five or so contractors are also pretty much devoid of personality. In this film, the Americans are largely non-people, too. One of the US mercenaries quotes from Joseph Campbell’s The Power of Myth in between playing on his Xbox. When they are not slaughtering the locals, our heroes spend much of their time lifting weights and acting macho.

The entire film and its publicity campaign resemble a video game. Make no mistake—13 Hours is aimed at susceptible kids fresh out of high school who can be snatched up by the military. The film’s simplistic plot borrows from the Fox News version of the Benghazi events: there were not enough US forces to guard the compound in 2012 thanks to back-stabbing officials in Washington (that is, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama).

In keeping with the outlook of the paranoid right wing, Bay’s film turns reality on its head. Here, US imperialism, the greatest perpetrator of violence in the world, is under siege, with its hands tied behind its back by bureaucratic red tape and cowardly civilian officials. If only “our boys” could get the support they really needed! There is more than a whiff of fascism in this.

In one of the movie’s pivotal scenes, CIA station chief “Bob” (David Costabile) tells our muscle-bound champions to “stand down” from defending the ambassador’s compound until they can figure out what is going on. According to the real-life CIA station chief, however, no such order was given. Moreover, the Republican-led committee investigating the Benghazi events concluded in November 2014 that there was “no evidence that there was either a stand down order or a denial of available air support.”

Bay’s “poetic license” contrasts the wavering civilian leadership with the indomitable mercenaries. “Bob” tells the crew that “there’s no real threat here,” dismissing the seemingly lax security at the ambassador’s compound. When the secret soldiers, or the Global Response Staff, as they like to be called, tour the facility, they are told by the State Department’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security that “Uncle Sam’s on a budget now” and they cannot request more men and weapons.

As a result of all this negligence (if not outright perfidy), our main characters and the audience itself have to endure a tedious version of the Battle of the Alamo. Even the action scenes, Bay’s supposed trademark, feel pointless for the most part. The many jump cuts in the editing are enough to cause a headache, and this reviewer was seated in the back row.

Bay is not the only guilty party here, or even the primary one. He had help on this project from powerful friends. Elements in the military-intelligence apparatus no doubt had their hand in its coming into being. 13 Hours was not premiered in Los Angeles or New York, but in Arlington, Texas, at AT&amp;T Stadium, home of professional football’s Dallas Cowboys.

Paramount Vice Chairman Rob Moore told the Hollywood Reporter, “Movies that honor the military, like Lone Survivor, definitely do better in Texas, Arizona and Nevada than in San Francisco and New York. This film has those same elements of military heroism—elements that appeal to a conservative audience.”

The studio placed an advertisement on Fox News for 13 Hours following Obama’s State of the Union address. Fox also broadcast a special hosted by Megyn Kelly, in which, according to the network, “three of the heroes,” Mark “Oz” Geist, Kris “Tanto” Paronto and John “Tig” Tiegen, “reflected on the 2012 attack and reacted to Michael Bay’s much-anticipated film.”

Despite the publicity campaign, 13 Hours has not done as well as hoped. It had the lowest box office opening of any of Bay’s films, and reviews were almost universally bad. That is an encouraging sign. Deadline Hollywood commented that the film was “drawing more noise from the CIA, Republicans and Democrats than moviegoers.”

Wonderfully, Paramount’s Moore then turned around and blamed the population for the less-than-resounding success: “It feels like it was hard for people to buy a ticket if they were more liberal leaning. It’s sad that this gets turned into a political debate as opposed to a conversation about who did the right thing and who was heroic.” He now complained that fewer people than expected went to see 13 Hours because it was “politicized”—after his studio did everything in its power to pander to the extreme right.

What was lead actor John Krasinski (The Office, Away We Go, Promised Land), a talented performer, even doing in this piece of rubbish? He chimed in along the same lines as Moore, telling the Daily Beast, “I am actually slightly disgusted at the idea that applauding our military has become a political thing rather than universal. … I would never say we shouldn’t talk politically about stuff—as long as step one is acknowledging these guys and what they went through that night.”

Fortunately, worship of the military is not “universal.” What is truly disgusting is that Libya no longer exists as a functioning society thanks to the very people that the makers of 13 Hours and others tell us to honor.

I am pointing religious party because they are the evil in the society when they are supposed to be the advisers and the good leadership of civilians. When they sell them selfs to the west (via the middle east  offices), they become wolfs wearing sheep's skin for people.
The degradation of a society always comes from their leadership. Ben Ali isn't a teacher of corruption, he is just from the people who are all encouraging corruption, same thing with Bourguiba and his family.
"" God won't change people until they change them selfs "".. meaning, is you and me are good, respectful, polite and friendly to eachother, God will most certainly send amongst us a good leader. If we are not, we will only pay the bill of our behavior.

&gt; The announcement came on the heels of an already growing military-security relationship: In the name of fighting terrorism, Tunisia has or will receive at least $81.9 million worth of military and security gear in 2016, including 12 Black Hawk helicopters along with Hellfire missiles, machine guns, night-vision goggles, and much more.

&gt; In 2013, Egypt&amp;#039;s then-defense minister, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, led Egyptian military forces in the ousting of President Mohamed Morsi, killing more than 1,000 of Morsi&amp;#039;s supporters in the process and jailing thousands more.

&gt; Melissa Dalton, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies&amp;#039; International Security Program, seemed more optimistic about oversight of military aid to Tunisia.

Having said that, I am against prostitution in any form, be it on line or IRL. Thinking only in regards to money is a very narrow way of thinking. Selling drugs or weapons to poor countries is also legal, but we shouldn't do it because it's unethical. In the same way allowing disadvantaged girls to endeavor in such undertakings, causing them to be shunned by this society for it, is not an ethical thing.

You know how the Tunisian society is, we have hypocrites, we have liars, we have all manner of shady behavior from people of all walks of life, and you want to add prostitution to that, as if there isn't enough of it yet? If you are worried about your precious money than you must think a little beyond the immediate business venture. A corrupted society is not a lucrative society. You will not be able to grow your business because your customers can't be trusted to make enough money to pay you.

I was actually surprised when OP posted this because few days ago i discussed this issue with my friends, didn't go deeply in it, but i just mention it that the government is wasting an important amount of money by not letting people invest in adult entertainment business.  

&gt;You know how the Tunisian society is, we have hypocrites, we have liars, we have all manner of shady behavior from people of all walks of life

FUCK'EM! 

These people exists anyway, and they will keep invading your life whenever they found an opportunity to do so, so being afraid of them wont improve anything.


&gt; and you want to add prostitution to that

You're saying it like its a super bad thing, it might be for people with certain morality backgrounds (mostly religious, specifically the Muslims ), but if you are someone with no religious restraint, who is willing to make easy money by stripping online, then why shouldn't you ? 


&gt;A corrupted society is not a lucrative society. You will not be able to grow your business because your customers can't be trusted to make enough money to pay you.

You're telling me, that if someone provided a platform where [hypocrite perverts](http://imgur.com/En2dzHN) who spent most of their life being suppressed of their basic sexual rights can **anonymously** pay a minor amount of money for a live meeting with a real local girl (or man) cannot be a profitable business ?? 

trust me mate, you have **NO IDEA** how fast that would sell, and if the platform allow the models to also act anonymously (wearing a mask or something) then they will never run out of ""products"", 

and if you don't believe me go take a look at all these chatroulettes sites and filter the location for Tunisian only (you'll see shitload of dicks though, so, don't blame me for that lol)",2016-07-02 14:09:31
d4wqy6b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/4qrhnj/,1,"My point was that if something is mad lucrative, that doesn't mean we should allow it, and that doing so without a thought about the consequences on society is a very risky thing. 

So a girl decides she wants to make money off the internet by stripping and dirty talking to a pervert. There is money in that, there's no denying it. But only for a short time, as the clientele for this sort of business is always on the lookout for someone new and as she gets older, the business starts making less money. You still want this girl to start a family, or at least have kids ( we still need to procreate, if for nothing then simply to create more client ). You also want her to raise them to be good, active members of society. Do you think this will be the case? Barring the odd poor girl that only uses this as a means to make ends meet, I believe the majority won't be like that. It will be just girls who want in on the easy cash.

You don't believe in fundamental transcending laws that forbid this, I get it. You don't want to forbid it just because God said you should. What I am trying to say is that the way a society is built greatly influences how the economy works. The government may make some money from this, but it will lose a lot from broken homes, kids who will not be well cared for at home who will either grow to be trouble makers or need the government's help to grow in a safe environment. All because we are taking measures that will surely undermine the family, which is the building block of society. It's simple math, this also applies to allowing or outlawing tobacco: you make money from the taxes, but you have to suffer an unhealthy work force that you have to spend money to help it stop its health from deteriorating further.  

When I see suggestions like this, it's probably made by people who see the example in western countries ( many of which outlaw prostitution by the way ). No matter how liberal a Tunisian you are, you probably hold family more to heart than a westerner does. This is a big difference. Countries where this works have societies that won't suffer as much as ours. And if we haven't degenerated into total chaos it's because we still have a semblance of a society that we can rely on.",2016-07-02 17:13:14
d4x1d58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/4qrhnj/,1,"&gt; You still want this girl to start a family, or at least have kids

no i don't, it's up to her to decide if she want to start a family and have kids.

With that said, i partially agree with some of the consequences you're talking about, but it wouldn't be as major as you are describing it, in fact it would have less effect that the current brothels are doing, everyone knows about them, only shitty desperate people go there, and most of the time its a secret that no one else will know about. 

An anonymous online ""show"" will actually have a lot less risks.

d5qrvd7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/4sl3pq/,1,"Amazing topic. I am arguing with my friends everyday about that.
I think that people (lets say 80%) are selfish and worship money more than God. They cheat on their brothers, friends, family to to get one dinar more and then go like ""i am a smart businessman"". Selfishness and hate towards the other is the cancer of the society. It reached a point that when someone says hello, he wants something from you..
The solution won't be education or a strong police system cause amongst schools and police corp, the same mentality is widely spread.
What I am gonna say now is really sad, but feel free to think about it. I think God is angry at us, because we used to have everything, even if some of us were poor, some were miserable, people used to laugh a lot, ben ali was maybe a mafia, today we have 10 mafias, good luck with that. Even the NGOs are financed by EU/US countries who will never give you real freedom to decide..
We are not receiving these punishments from God with no reason. We deserve it. We all worship money, we rarely help poor people, we love to show off, we love to use our acquaintances to get a paperwork faster, or a job for a friend or family member, we want to become ""westernized"" so we go there and lick shoes then bring NGOs here, fake selfish diplomacy etc.. we did everything. nothing came from the void. We hate each other and we show it mutually everyday on the streets...
If people today want to save their lives, they should remember that the richer of them, the poorer, the powerful of them can sleep by night and never wake up. God is gonna judge everyone with no retrospective punishment … He know best who was nice to be nice and who was nice and fake.
I pray for all of us to wake up one day, and think about the death and the life, and that God is watching us.
"" God gave an obvious example of a safe city to which he sent limitless  goods and food from everywhere, and when they disbelieved and rejected the goods, He put on it the cover of fear and hunger ""!!!
fear is terrorism today, and hunger is the coming poverty.

For the past 3 years i've been a legit student (going to college daily and work on my free time) 2016 was the only year where i worked full time after dropping college, my banker said that there is no need to ""start a company"" because the government is going to legalize the ""freelancer statue"" in the country, so i didn't bother.  

And personally i **REALLY REALLY HATE** our administrative system (all the waiting and useless bureaucracy bs), i'll do everything i can to avoid it, that's why i didn't care about legalizing my work before, now it became a necessity.

In the first case you don't have to start a company, I'm pretty sure you can continue doing freelance until you stop studying and then (if you actually want to be legal) start paying taxes as an independent worker (عامل يومي, kinda), the second case you should talk to a lawyer

People are naturally cautious. Societies that tend to be less trusting, tend to be societies where there is weak regulation, weak laws, and/or poor enforcement of laws. Rome wasn't built in a day and a developed Tunisia will not take a day to build. 

Go abroad and see how people really act when they know they are likely to get away with something selfish. Subway stations without a guard: people jump the pay barrier, 4 way stop sign intersection with no cop or camera: the stop sign is a decoration, got stopped by an officer: many police departments in the US issue special cards to friends and families of officers so they can walk away.

People in need are more aggressive i will say, especially when you add to this a weak legal system like in ""third world countries"", or highly corrupted system of lobbies in ""developed countries"". I can mention so many example I witnessed in the US, EU and Middle east where you can cheat the system with money.
To get back to Tunisia specific, everything said here is more a zoom in into the capital and some big cities, or linked to the capital trends and businesses. I went to some very small villages or cities and people where so lovely, so easy going and so not into money.
I really believe today that if you want to leave peacefully and surrounded by kind people you have to leave the big cities, whether it's NY, Paris or Tunis, people there are getting brain washed and dishumanized .. and I think they gonna be the reason of the collapse of their own countries soon. Selfishness and avarice lead to jealousy and hatred which are the cancer of the societies like a Wise Man said once.",2016-08-08 14:46:09

Thanks man! and sure why would i stop ;) ?

&gt; How do you get paid over the Internet? 

Depends on who you working with, but for me these are the services that i used : 

* Payoneer

* Netteler 

* WorldRemit

* WesternUnion 

* Direct Bank Transfer

&gt; Do you use any specific bank? 

It doesn't matter they are all shit, just pick the closest Bank to your house.

&gt; Where do you get the jobs? 

I started on Odesk.com now its called Upwork.com , there you can find people looking for  freelancers, you have to send the client a message answer few question, set your price, and hope he pick you over the other freelancers, its tough in the beginning but i got my first 3 jobs from that Website. 

The rest of the good jobs (the long term ones) where somehow a bit of luck, for example i found my first long term job in the unity forum after answering some guy question, that guy then become my client for ~16 months. As for my current job, the client is Australian, and last year, Crossy Road was a SUPER HIT on the mobile market, and it was made by Australians too, so the client was kinda hyped for it and was looking for something similar or something, and he found [this post of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/low_poly/comments/2ukj6w/blender_my_first_try/) , then he took a look into [my blog](http://alaslipknot.tumblr.com/) and that's it, we've been working together since November 2015. So there isn't a specific formula, but, there is for sure something that you need to do, which is keep creating, specially if you are into game development, for other fields i really don't have too much experience. 

&gt; Do you have any specific website?

My website ? yes, [a blog](http://alaslipknot.tumblr.com/) 

Or a website for work ? for work i only used Odesk.com (upwork) but i highly recommend being active in forums and subreddits of your area of expertise.

&gt; Do you learn/work at night or do you sleep normal ?

LOL! normal my ass! sometime i force my self to go to gym just to get tired and be able to sleep at night, my sleeping pattern was already fucked before starting freelancing because my first internet connection was a shitty Orange (clé 3g limité) so i became Batman since i was 16 years old lol, but even after having an unlimited ADSL connection it is very common to stay awake the whole night for so many reasons (better internet, less noise, less people, timezone necessity, etc..)

&gt; How did your girlfriend help you? XD 

Moral support is very important, when you are getting started you won't have any money, specially in the learning phase, and when you drop out of college and become the failure of the family you really need some positive push to keep going forward, specially if you are overwhelmed by some programming issue that you have no idea how to fix, without good moral support you will rise your chance to quit, and my gf is the best in that (we're spending a 20 days holidays in Seoul-South korea now, am writing you from there haha)

Anyway, 

Good luck mate, and don't quit, and keep it in mind that you if you are going to work in some company in Tunisia, then your whole life will be miserable, no traveling, no goodies to buy when they come out, nothing, it will be just **eat-work-sleep-repeat** and i don't think you want that. 

Good luck",2016-10-02 02:57:58

Fat Burger... fucking love this place.  It's expensive but... holy crap that's a burger.  Nearly as good as mine ;)

daex1mx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/5eha01/,1,"Thanks for your reply. Unfortunately time is not something I have right now, because I'm arriving there next week on 1st December in Tunis.
About the university, I know it's the Faculty of Science( that's probably the university) and I tried calling them too but I think international calls don't pass through them? I call, it picks up on last moment and then hangs( I believe it hits a voicemail that's why it hangs up). 

I will try calling the department you talked about, but what do they speak better in Tunisia? French or English? I can talk both but i want them to understand me clearly.

It's really bad how they provide scholarships in Tunisia.. I was selected by my country 4months ago, university started in september, Tunisia( through embassy of Pretoria) replies back of the acceptance only now..And tell me to report back to the university at earliest possible( with signed date 15 November). Now for one, I'm really worried about the 2months I missed on ""Licenses fondamental des sciences de l'informatique"", 2nd due to the fact they didnt provide details, I don't even know how it's gonna work for the housing( campus or outside).

But yeah, first thing I will do is go to the university, get the papers and confirmation and details, then go straight to my country's embassy or bureau to do the VISA. 

Oh yeah another question, I want to create a bank account that provides facilities for international transfer, if I'm gonna arrive at Tunis airport then go to Monastir, what do you recommend I pick as bank company. It should be something located in Monastir also and easy to goto, If you have any idea please do tell.",2016-11-25 10:05:59

dafk91t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/5eha01/,1," hey there again , I really feel for you , reaching to tunisian administrations is  such a burden .

1) Did you try sending an email to the faculty? I also figured they have a facebook private group  ( faculté de sciences de Monastir ) , you may join it and ask sb there for help , hopefully  it's an active group.
 Always use french first , as french is the second language of the county , if they don't understund you the  you may use english .

2) money part : whatever you do , don't leave the airport before ' faire une déclaration de ton argent chez la douane de l'aéroport ' . I dunno how it's actually done but I know without that declaration the bank will not accept your money ( been there before with my friend who is a foriegner  and it was astonishing cos no one ever mentioned that  ) . 
I suggest you make a bank account in Monastir , there is the ATB (Tunisian arabic bank ) and the BIAT who I think are mostly frequented by foriegner students ( we went to the ATB last year and they told us that ) 

3) dorm part : I honestly have no idea how you're joining the course two months after it already started .lessons are gonna are gonna stop from 18 December to 2nd january , so it's two free weeks for student to prepare for their first term exams which start in the first week of january . 
I also dunno if they give  public dorms to foreigners who arrive in december as usually students apply for the dorms in auguest and it's pretty crowded there .thaugh living outside is possible for reasonable prices ( my brother who studied in Monastir during two years shared a three room apparment with two other guys for 125 TND ( around 60 USD ) per month  ) ). I may give the office  that's in charge of dorms stuffs a call and ask if you want .

hope this was helpful to you , if you have any further questions don't hesitate to ask :)

I recently came into contact with a girl who went on the same scholarship last year( though she dropped and came back because she could not cope with the subject).

It appears they already have your campus room booked already since it's for scholarship because she told me she was able to go to campus even though she afterwards rented a house because she's telling me it's dirty in the campus.

As for the studies, I will really have to do it the hard way but thankfully most things in the electrical classes( kirchoff and charge) I know the basics. Only problem is everything is in French and I don't really know how to convert what I've learned in maths and physics classes to french, but i'm just gonna have to adapt and try to get the teachers to help me somehow. It seems they even do general classes on ""English"" and ""Droit de l'homme""

If you or anyone you know did course in Licenses fondamental des sciences de l'informatique, if possible, send the notes if they are in french(2 first months of university till first exams) on shujaatkhanumarkhan@gmail.com

You also seem to imply that speaking French is a restriction or a ""limitating factor"" for these countries, when it is actually a major factor for an international economic/political/cultural development that they wouldn't have otherwise (even if they spoke English, look at african English speaking countries... they're actually doing less good than francophone african countries in terms of GDP growth) 

P.S. French is largely as much an African or northern american language as it is a European language... it's spoken by 300 Million people worldwide (that's leaving aside France/Belgium/Luxembourg/Switzerland/Monaco/Andorra). You cannot just go around saying English is the sole lingua franca for anything. Because, often, it will be another language (may it be French, Spanish, Chinese, Arabic, Russian etc.). The world has a history and that history bears meaning and socio-political implications at present times, including language.

Mandarin is the most spoken language in absolute numbers... that doesn't mean it's the international language of politics or trade...

English is the most taught language overall, that doesn't mean it is the universal language of science, local politics, sports, arts etc.

French is the 2nd most taught language overall, that doesn't mean it's the lingua franca for trade or science either. 

Everything isn't black or white; the more languages you know, the better. The world you propose with a ""ruling language"" isn't attractive and it isn't happening. ",2016-11-30 23:31:16

here's the recipe for home made harissa http://www.latunisienne.fr/harissa-tunisienne-maison-harissa-3arbi/. You can ""adjust"" the hotness by choosing a more hot red pepper and reduce the quantity of olive oil.

Sousse is the 3rd biggest city. And it s 30 min away from mounastir.
Mounastir is very small, so small that you wouldn t need a car to room around.

As someone who has been there, during the low season months, I had the feeling that it's such a seasonal destination, idk if Tunisia is growing right now but I'd like to know your opinion on that. 

Also talking with Tunisian people, I learned that there was hope after the revolution but that it was chaotic and although people are more free about what they can say, their day to day life didn't get better. For example kids could go out and play until dark, crime rates were lower etc. Now there's kinda a tension feeling going on. That was my feeling. I was there in 2015 and 2016.

 I also had the opportunity to talk with a un worker in the plane and what she said was basically that Tunisia was too soft on criminals and terrorists comparing with Morocco. Finally what's your opinion about Lybians living in Tunis? And the security issues in the border towns. 

Besides all of that you do have an amazing country! It's one of my favourite destinations. ",2016-12-27 16:33:38

On another note the story of the teacher bullying the black girl is completly true and it was a public opinion case, the media spoke about it and you can find articles everywhere so the documentary is so missleading and shady.  
bare in mind that indeed there are some racist people and that is normal because you don't expect every single individual to be an angel and the country itself doesn't tolerate racism or racist behaviour..
