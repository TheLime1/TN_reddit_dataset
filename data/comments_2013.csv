c8v8y1s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1a8n23/,8,"Welcome! I'm an American and lived in Tunisia for about two years so I'll try to get you set up with some tips and advice. First, what is it that you like to do? Also, what school will you be teaching with? Are you going to be in either Tunis or Sfax and for how long in each? Let me give you some advice:

1) Don't refuse PROPER hospitality - your gut will tell you whether or not someone is trying to take advantage of you or if a friend is trying to provide help. Also, when you're invited over someone's home DO NOT refuse tea and if you're invited to dinner, even though you might feel your kerch expanding, have another brik or bowl of couscous! It'll make your hosts happy.

2) Thing will break, people will be late, and not a lot will run on time - Tunisia is a fun, laid back country. I had two friends meet me for drinks and while I was 30 mins late, they were both an hour late and argued that they came on time. Take the extra 10 minutes at the cafe to enjoy your coffee. If you're late to things blame the bus (avoid the yellow buses in Tunis if you can) or lack of taxis. Does depend on your work environment though!

3) DO NOT insult the country - Tunisian people are proud of their accomplishments and the sheer natural beauty of the place. Insult the politics, it's ok to say that the ""mentality"" has to change, put down the littering, but don't say anything bad about the country. Depending on who your friends are, you can criticize certain lifestyles. Be sure they keep it to themselves. Tunisians are rightly proud of their heritage and what their small country has achieved since independence. 

3) Get out of the city! - Want to go to crystal clear beaches? Go to Sidi Ali el-Mekki or Kelibia or countless other places. Want to go to the mountains? Spend a night in Ain Drahem and go hiking around there. Roman sites? Dougga and El-Djem are excellent. Explore the country while you are there - car rentals are cheap and driving is not THAT crazy. You can also take a louage (8-9 seater shared long-distance taxi) for relatively cheap

4) Attempt to speak ARABIC - You will be way better received if you just try to speak Arabic to people. Say ""sa7a"" when people do anything, ask if people are ""le bass?"" and they'll be more likely to assist you. If you speak French, you can do so to communicate but sprinkle in some Arabic and people will be thrilled that a foreigner is speaking THEIR language. Believe me

5) Know when to drink and where to drink - you can drink in Tunisia but you need to know where and when. Lots of Tunisians drink but you want to avoid conflict so try to avoid outright public intoxication (I've done it and it's been OK and most people in Tunis know what this looks like but remember alcohol abuse is frowned upon). Do not, under any circumstances, drink on the streets. Depending on the beach, you can sometimes pack a cooler full of Celtias and sit out all day. Also, Ramadan is taken VERY seriously, most bars will be closed and those that are open will only serve foreigners. People get very ornery during Ramadan and will not like dealing with drunk people. I used to stock up and just drink at home (7aram, I know) during that month. 

That should get you started. Tunisia's a great place and I miss it a lot. Be open minded and realize that not everything is going to be what it seems. Best of luck, you'll do well!",2013-03-14 02:17:20

cal2quc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1gia8s/,3,"Hello there,

I am pretty sure you will love it here. There are many places for you to visit but it all depends on your preferences and the way you have planned for your trip, so if you are going with a group of tourists (as in an organized trip by a travel agency and not having planned everything on your own) the trip would be already planned and they will take you to the best places in Tunisia. 

As a general inside information, food in some hotels isn't really that good, I mean, as a tunisian, I have been to many hotels, and usualy five stars hotels aren't bad, but lower than that rate can be horrible sometimes except from breakfast, so my advice would be to rather to go to restaurants where food can be really good and not so expensive! nearly about 60 dinars (TND) for a couple at very good rated restaurants (I could give you a detailed list when you are about to come to Tunisia).

As a general inside information, you can have a nice community to come back to whenever you need, maybe asking more specific questions, and we will be very glad to help out!

calcle0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1gia8s/,3,"It is actually pretty easy,  this is the [site](http://www.sncft.com.tn/index.php) of the Train transportation in Tunisia, the ticket isn't that expensive, 10 dinars, first class, it has A/C, the trip lasts about 2 hours. 

Well about the way women are treated in here, treating them as meat is kind of exaggerated but take it from a tunisian woman here, she could be hit on quite a lot, sometimes even to the point where it gets very annoying, just go with it and try to avoid getting into conversations with that type of guys but I can assure you, you will meet some nice good people.

Do not trust strangers though! Do not go out with lot of cash on you! Make sure to not leave your important tools/electronics in hotel and pay lot of attention to where you put them, just try to always have the least of things with you (just phone and photograph maybe).

At night during summer (especially Ramadhan starting 10th July) Sousse is pretty active, there are plenty of clubs/cafés/restaurants that will be open for public, so it is safe to hang out during summer (less that much during Winter).

I am pretty sure you will enjoy it here, so many tourist come here and get taken by the beauty and multiplicity of the sights. If you ever needed recommendations on what restaurants/places to go to, or what other cities you should visit, do not hesitate to send a pm.

Edit/ I forgot to mention that I have been in Morocco too! Casablanca, and it isnt that different from Tunisia, we do have very similar aspects of life in general, same cutural background, but different features of it.",2013-06-18 17:48:59

Just arrived back in England and Tunisia was beautiful in everyway. The people were friendly, helpful and open. The food is excellent, ranging from street takeaways to posh restaurants, and the country itself has a beautiful atmosphere as well as natural beauty and feels very alive!

My advice would be similar to Enti_San. Don't walk around casually with obviously expensive things including designer sunglasses etc... Don't trust strangers but also don't be afraid of them.

With regards to your girlfriend there is no immediate danger but she must be prepared to put up with staring and general hassle. However, from what I saw in Tunisia it is not much different to how a lot of people n the UK treat women (beeping horns, shouting out of cars etc...)",2013-06-19 18:41:46

The beaches, Carthage, Sidi Bousiid and Touristy areas are not targeted places by political activists.

c8w1vp9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1a8n23/,2,"The Arabic you learn with Rosetta Stone won't be of much use to you, unfortunately. Tounsi is pretty far removed from Modern Standard Arabic, vocabularly-wise. RS will help with the grammar but I found that a background in French actually helped a lot more on a day-to-day basis. Most Tunisians will probably try speaking to you in French first, assuming you're white. But like bara_nik said, if you make it clear that you want to speak Arabic with them they'll immediately switch. If they start speaking French just reply in Arabic and they should get the hint.

&gt;I would love to visit places of historical importance, natural beauty spots and places that are used by the vast majority of locals, markets etc..

Just avoid the resorts and all-inclusive hotels and you're fine. When I lived there last summer I found that there weren't many places that had been overrun by tourists. I was near Sidi Bou Said, probably one of the biggest tourist attractions in the greater Tunis area, and on weekend nights the majority of the people there were locals. El Jem, Dougga and Carthage all have awesome Roman ruins. Kairouan is a bit of a hike depending on where you live but is hugely important in the history of Islam, and gives a very different perspective from coastal cities. 

&gt; I like football and wouldn't mind watching a game or two if you have any suggestions?

[Esperance](http://www.e-s-tunis.com/EST/news/index.html) and [Club Africain](http://www.clubafricain.com/home) are the two teams. Both are based in Tunis so if you're near the city it shouldn't be hard to get to a game. Pretty much any men's cafe will show matches when they're on, they're good places to hang out and meet people.

&gt;I have another question, you mentioned that it is considered impolite to refuse tea and such, but does this extend to the invitation itself; for example, if I am invited out for a meal is it impolite to refuse?

Unless you have a pretty damn good excuse, I would say accept the invitation. Tunisians take their hospitality very seriously.",2013-03-15 10:40:21

I used to also play ""Ali Ba Ba's cavern"" with my cousins, I would like to think of it as an enhanced ""Fort Boyard"" version, two of my cousins would prepare a room that should be totally dark and that should have all kinds of scary fluorescent forms and shapes (from insects, webs, watches), they would hide a treasure (plenty of fake coins) at one part of the room that should be found within like three minutes, the players should go in, this dark room, while a scary music would be playing and find the treasure within the given time, otherwise it is lost, small hints will be given. It was such a great exciting game, I miss these moments.

During the aid, we would also use the fake guns, and separate teams of players into bad guys (the thieves) and good guys (police) the rest is just a work of our imagination.

If a person is prestending to be diplomatic and chose a potential representative of this government then never accepted any other party's designation, does the word diplomatic or democratic apply to them?

There is really more to it than being a simple matter of mistrust, there is a hidden agenda. The fact that this situation occured at the same time as a seriously dangerous change on the deployment of the country's next year's Budget and new taxations, raises many questions.

The country is dying and they are mainly responsible for that.

Regarding their ""democratic"" election, don't forget how they manipulated and bribed people thanks to Qatar and Saudi Arabia's money and influence.

I see others have already covered some topics, I'd like to add that the political scene is a little bit ""intense"" right now, there are some peaceful protests sometimes but nothing to be scared of.

Sfax is a very crowded city, and people have a unique way of driving there (they get really close to other cars, they don't respect the lights sometimes etc.. so I wouldn't recommend driving).

Sorry about the late answer, it is just that I started a new job and had to move from Sousse to Tunis, and was very busy lately.

And also concerning your safety, things have changed after the ""revolution back on 14th January 2011"", so I hope you will take this advice pretty seriously, never go to suspicious places or places that are deserted, always keep yourself surrounded with people. Never go alone past 8pm. By saying this, doesn't mean that you can't enjoy your stay, on the very contrary, crimes can be really scarce, but they raised in number. Not to make you scared or anything, but lately I heard of a horrible crime that happened near Tunis, a married couple went to the beach on a sunny weekend (beaches are empty at this time of the year), they were robbed by three guys who later on raped the pregnant wife right in front of her husband.

Just be careful and know who you are hanging out with, don't go out with lot of cash on you, nor fancy electronic things, the less the better. :) You will meet great people, and enjoy your time I m sure of it.

From what I recall this is a propaganda photo from the last regime, probably the tunisian public tv formerly called tv7 and renamed after the revolution because 7 was Ben Ali's lucky number as he's done his coup d'etat the 7th lf november 1987. Anyways this photo of Bouazizi was a few days before he died and they wanted to show us how great Ben Ali was because he visited him...

Does it answer your question? Let me know otherwise.

Edit: I don't think Bouazizi was able to speak or even conscious at that moment.

Edit2: i'm pretty sure the source is TV7 I remember watching it on TV 2.5 years ago. But this tv has been replaced and I suppose their contents are not available anymore.

In Rize, another city, the situation became infinitely more dire as police chased a large group of protesters into a building *only to pull back and let a pro-government mob to surround and stone the building for hours*.

Regarding what is happening in Tunisia, I think[ this article](http://www.tunisia-live.net/2013/08/06/amid-dueling-demonstrations-parties-float-concessions-and-dialogue/) could explain exactly the recent events that took place yesterday;

I would resume what happened in the following though, after the political assassinations of two leading characters of the opposition (the popular front party) and in the lights of what the extremist ""Annsar Ashariaa"" clan  and terrorists (the supporters of Ashariaa) did, the tunisian people does no longer tolerate these failures from a leading party that is constantly trying to lure and gain time to prevail its ideologies and loyals among the key positions in the government, the present ruling party eventhough it was elected, is no longer needed when it doesn't represent the people's will.",2013-08-07 07:47:04

His last trip to the US is a trip that most heads of states do around this time of the year to address the General Assembly at the UN.

At the same time he gave a couple of speeches (and excellent ones) to promote Tunisia and to clarify some ideas about the country with the US public as well as with other decision makers in the US.
