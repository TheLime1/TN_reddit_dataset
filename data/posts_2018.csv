7q1szy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/7q1szy/,11,"What I know of Tunisia is that it is the Arab's Spring success story. Is this true? If so, why is its role so underrated in the Arab Spring's history?","Hi. Press about Tunisia has been sporadic in the West at best about Tunisia, so about three years ago I went there on vacation for 2 weeks. I decided to drive around and couchsurf. The people I met and the places I visited made my time there an absolute wonder.

I liked to talk about how the country was doing, and met with a few guys from a local atheist group. A British historian who had been there for 40odd years. A 25 year old Tunisian girl who I fell in love with, and made out with secretly, safe distance away from the woman's hostel where she lived. I spoke with liberal elite intellectuals in Tunis, and even with the then campaign manager from Nidaa Tounes, because there were elections coming up. That was all in fluent English.

I loved it then, but only now realize my limited slice of Tunisia I saw. With many locals I only had small conversations in my very limited French. No deep discussions. 

Still, in 2014 Tunisia felt to me as a few years after the fall of the Berlin Wall in Germany. (I was there then as a visitor but I was only 10. So what did I know...) I haven't been to Tunisia since then, and news is sparse. 

I noticed how Wikipedia's Arab Spring page doesn't place Tunisia front and center of the Arab Spring. The lead-up to the Arab Spring omits Bouazizi's story. The 'results' doesn't speak about Tunisia's successes. I find all that lack of attention so incredibly odd. Are we missing a success story, or is there nothing to celebrate? 

And that's why I came here:

How is Tunisia doing?
And why is it so underrated in its role in the Arab Spring?
Is Mohamed Bouazizi considered a national hero?
Where is Tunisia going to?

TL;DR: Anyone providing any insight into the questions above would be great.

PS As a thank you to the country and its role in the Arab Spring, I went to Mohamed Bouazizi's grave and took a picture of his grave for Wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Bouazizi ",,,,,,2018-01-13 02:38:53

We would be more than glad to read your reactions

What do you think about the idea? Do you think that our content can be relevant to learners and teachers in Tunisia or other Arabic countries?

Mehdi is on the content/writing/scripting and I'm handling the editing/social media and technical stuff.

So constructive criticism is very welcomed.

I would like to know more about Tunisia, and reading the Wikipedia article is just too limited for me (and I'm always very skeptical about what I found on Wikipedia anyway).

I've found a bunch of old French books about the history of Tunisia on the [Gallica](http://gallica.bnf.fr) (digital library of the the French National Library):

* (1874) [Principales époques de la Tunisie : documents pour servir à l'histoire de ce pays](http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k62043355), by A. Oualid.
* (1887) [Essai sur l'histoire des Israélites de Tunisie : depuis les temps les plus reculés jusqu'à l'établissement du protectorat de la France en Tunisie](http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k58167845), by David Cazès.
* (1892) [Histoire générale de la Tunisie, depuis l'an 1590 avant Jésus-Christ jusqu'en 1883](http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k58046393), by Abel Clarin de La Rive.
* (1893) [La Tunisie avant et depuis l'occupation française](http://gallica.bnf.fr/services/engine/search/sru?operation=searchRetrieve&amp;version=1.2&amp;collapsing=disabled&amp;query=dc.relation%20all%20%22cb304203291%22), by Narcisse Faucon.
* (1894) [Histoire de la Tunisie](http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k62056736), by Auguste Pavy.
* (1905) [La Tunisie](http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k58068209), by G. Dervin.
* (1910) [Petite histoire de la Tunisie](http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k62093060), by Mlle L. Métivier.

I haven't read these books yet, but the younger is a bit more than 100 years old, so I suppose the approach towards History has changed since then, and that some newer discoveries has also been made.

So if you have any book to recommend, of if you have read one of these books already and have an opinion about it, I would love to hear it.",,,,,,2018-04-10 08:23:23

Thursday: Arrive Tozeur at 15:25. Spend the night in Tozeur.

Friday: Mides, Tamerza, Chebika (is this too busy for 1 day?)

Saturday: [open] Chott El Jerid and Douz? Tamezret or Matmata? (too far?)

Sunday: [open] Depart Tozeur at 16:00


I'm interested to explore natural wonders (the Oases, the dessert) and traditional Tunisian activities/places.

8oh6at,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/8oh6at/,6,Help: spheric/circular objects from Tunisian culture,"Hey

I’m a graphic designer from Portugal. I wanted to design a series of posters for the upcoming World Cup, and while brainstorming around the idea of the ball I came up with the idea of having each poster showcase some kind of spheric or circular object that is traditional/specific to each country in the World Cup, something that is beautiful or tasty or meaningful or useful or historic or for some reason relevant to the country.

So, having said this, can you guys think of any objects, tools, foods, symbols, artworks, plants, animals or really anything at all past or present from or relating to Tunisia that might be a good center-piece for the Tunisian poster?

Everyone knows the top players from each country and I thought these posters could be a good way of people all around learning about a lesser known aspect of each culture, so please don’t be afraid of throwing in far-fetched, little known stuff, as long as they are somehow relevant to your local/national culture. They don’t even have to be real, it can be something, for example, out of a folk tale.

Thank you so much everyone for your time and your help! 

PS: a version of this post will be posted across all the national subreddits of countries participating in the World Cup.",,,,,,2018-06-04 13:16:21

8ripa1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/8ripa1/,26,Aidkom mabrouk everyone! At this occasion I felt like giving my 2 cents on the state of the Subreddit (Meta post),"Aidkom mabrouk! Whether believers or not, I hope you enjoyed celebrating with your family and/or friends.

I wanted to talk a bit about r/Tunisia since it has been a long time since we last did. These last months I noticed a rise of the random Tunisian users I encounter on Reddit, and this is just on the subs I frequent like r/Soccer and r/leagueoflegends. There is about [80 Tunisian flairs on r/soccer](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccerbot/wiki/africa/tunisia), and this [6k upvotes post](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/712knt/in_tunisia_buying_8250_rp_costs_193_dinars_the/) had a lot of Tunisians too.

However, I never saw most of these Tunisian users participating here. When questioning some of them, they would cite the inactivity of this sub, calling it ""dead"". But here's the thing : People aren't refraining from coming because the ""sub is dead"", it's the other way around. Abstention will create and accentuate inactivity.

Of course, I'm not saying any Tunisian redditor is entitled to come take part here. It should be an effort from both sides. If this place becomes more attractive to people, user base will inevitably increase. So first i'm gonna talk about what distinguishes r/tunisia and Reddit from other available social medias :

* The upvote/downvote system : It's not a perfect one, but it helps distinguish good and bad content. It also help having moderators to remove spam. Also the Reddit karma system ""rewards"" users for posting good content.

* English discussions : It is allowed to talk in derja/french here, but there isn't a lot of english places on the internet about tunisia. The only other one I know is the expats in Tunisia group on Facebook.

* The niche aspect : If you feel like Facebook/Instagram are too mainstream for them, some people could find Reddit comfortable and refreshing for them. It's much easier to talk about ""taboo"" topics here because of anonymity. It also helps that there's a lot of very useful subreddits on this website.

Right now, the most frequent topic here is by far asking about informations on Tunisia. That's of course fantastic, we Tunisians love to talk about our country and it means people are interested about it. But here's what we could gladly see more of :

* Humourous content : There's no rules against memes/low effort content. If you found something funny you thought about sharing it on Facebook or to friends, post it here! We will probably like it too.

* Tunisian OCs : if you saw a drawing/song/cool thing made by a Tunisian, feel free to share! Tunisian youtube channels are also welcome.

* Travel pics and experiences : If you recently made a trip to Tunisia and captured some cool sceneries, it would be cool to see them. It would be also interesting to hear how people felt about it. by the way places reviews are okay, as long as it's not cheap advertisement.

* Popular topics : We all know that Tunisians turn into 11 million politicians in elections and 11 million coaches in sports tournaments. It would be nice to discuss more of those. The world cup just started for example, it's an excellent occasion to talk about how the Tunisian team will do under the world's spotlight.

Quick note : Just because it would be nice to get bigger, doesn't mean it's okay to break Rule 1.

**TL;DR : This place is nice but it can be much better. Be the change you want to see.**

So far I only know Twahachtek (or Twahashtek? I see different spellings). Hemchi (?). And a “dirty” one 😅. 
Oh, and Hobi or Hob but I don’t know if that’s for a friend or a partner/wife.

Even more astonishing when it's a very expensive restaurent and some leave half their plates or even barely touch it. Some even do that in ""All you can eat"", which means they throw away a lot of food they choose themselves to consume in the first place. All of that food is going to the trash can after all (although some restaurents offer you to take it). And this is just was i saw in public places, I know for a fact many households throw away any unfinished platerather than keep it for next meal. I feel bad when I leave something edible tbh.

Is it considered ""normal"" and is the same case in other places or is it actually something tunisians do a lot?",,,,,,2018-07-28 14:49:43

During todays Galatasaray Club Africain match I noticed that the atmosphere was pumped and the tunisian side played really phisically.

Also I noticed that on social media many tunisian supporters were really pumped about the match. They posted on masses on GS sites.

Also I had to think about the tunisia turkey friendly game ahead of the world cup where I felt alot of hatred against the turks and where fans breached the pit at the end of the game.

So I wanna know what makes those supporters so pumped up for such a behaviour in friendly games. Is it a sort of hatred towards turkish/ottoman culture or is it just tunisian mentality?

Je suis Francais, la trentaine, software engineer, et ma femme est Franco-Tunisienne (data scientist).
Nous vivons aux US, mais nous reflechissons a nous rapprocher de nos familles respectives.

Dans notre domaine, le marche du travail est plus attractif en Europe a priori, mais je me demandais ce qu'il en etait en Tunisie. Y a-t-il des gens qui bossent dans l'IT parmis vous ? Si oui, pouvez-vous m'en dire un peu plus sur l'etat du marche du travail dans le domaine en Tunisie ? Je suis interesse par:

- la base: si ca embauche, tout simplement
- la base (bis): les salaires
- le type de boites qui embauchent (startups? fonction publique? multi-nationales?)
- les endroits ou le marche est le plus attractif (Tunis j'imagine, mais y a-t-il d'autre boites)
- la culture au travail: est-ce que le travail a domicile est facilement accepte, les relations entre collegues, etc.

Par ailleurs, je n'ai pas la nationalite Tunisienne. Dans quelle mesure est-ce un handicap ?

PS: comment sont percus les Francais en Tunisie globalement ? Quand j'ai rencontre des expats j'avais un peu l'impression qu'ils vivaient en communaute fermee, la plupart de parlant meme pas l'arabe... Ca ne me fait pas rever. Vous avez des exemples de Francais qui arrivent a s'integrer ?

9aoefg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/9aoefg/,7,A discussion about the future of Tunisia,"Hello, 

a few days ago, I ve had a discussion with a relative about the future of Tunisia and, since we ve had diverging POV, I'd like to have your opinion about that : 

Her Pov: 

In the next few years, because of poverty and conservatism, Ennahda will get elected. Right after their elections, using their connexion with countries like Qatar &amp;co, they will show quick economic results (unemployment &amp;co) . Then the population will become grateful to them and they will get reelected. Slowly but surely, we'd lose all the freedom we got from the revolution and end up in a situation similar to Iran.

In 3 decades, people will be opposing the gov's conservative policies and we'd end up, like Iran, in a situation where atheism thrives.

After that a revolution happens again and the country becomes a stable western country.

That would be for ""the best""

&amp;#x200B;

My POV : 

The two last statements are wishful thinking. In the next few decades, most likely, AI and Automation will become increasingly important in our daily life. As a consequence, a big political reform will become necessary. The west is already talking/thinking about UBI&amp; such. And for a reason.

In circumstances where another ""industrial revolution"" happens, it'd be best to have a government that is democratic (=&gt; people focused) and that react quickly (progressist ).

As a result, having Ennahda win will lead to a short but inconsistant growth in standards of living. After a decade, they wont be able to implement the policies necessary for the next tech revolution. =&gt; People will suffer after 10-15 years. This will lead to situation where ""Tunisia missed the right moment to implement its policies"" and another few decades of poverty.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead, the ""instable Nida or whatever that is not conservative "",ideally someone young, would be much better. (even with all their flaws)

Although we'd face short term consequences (as we already do), they would at the very least react with more ""open mindedness"" to a tech change.

Also, they will be able to get some experience during the current years which isnt to be neglected as it might lead to benefits at the moment of the tech rev.

Even if they ""miss it"", since the gov will still be a democracy, the possibility of the following ""elected party"" not missing it isnt 0.

&amp;#x200B;

In the end, we would benefit from the tech rev and we could use it as an accelerator to get a ""better country"".

Ofc, that might be wishful thinking on my part :/

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, what do you think about that? what do you think will happen? and how?

9izc1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/9izc1i/,6,Here to ask a few questions about your country and history!,"Hi, salut, marhaba, etc. I am doing some university coursework for a course on muslim history and modernism and your country is my main focus. Just wondering if you all can answer a few questions for me:

1. Is there one event that serves as a sort of unifier in shaping Tunisian culture? It can be recent or not. 
2. How do most Tunisians (or you, personally) identify? As mostly arab, mostly berber, mostly muslim, mostly north african/maghrebi, etc?
3. Is the public today mostly secular, mostly non-practicing religious or mostly religious conservative? It would be great if you can answer from the perspective of both the public, at large and the government.
4. Are you as young people mostly optimistic about the future. Can anyone comment on how the political atmosphere has changed since 2011? 

Thank you all, I really appreciate it. Please bother your mods about doing a cultural exchange with us at /r/lebanon !

Edit: also, if any of you are living in America, I would like to know where I can get really good canned harissa. thank you!",,,,,,2018-09-26 04:26:08

As far as I know no one passed by us. But somehow 10 minutes later a cops car appeared by us and starting provoking then questioning us, searching the car, then saying we will go to the police station to do a ""mahdher"". In the end of the day they let us go after saying we were ""3a9lin"", ofc after one of them made sure to get my gf's number.

Why is this a thing? I get it, Tunisians are very ""sensitive"" and get annoyed by the sight of people loving each other, but it's not like we bothered anyone. I had to playthe yes man and apologize to the cops in order to get away with it, rather than argue with him, but one of his arguments was ""we're a muslim country"", why is this relevant ? We're also a free country, or at least we're supposed to be. You know what's worse in all this? Someone probably saw us and had suspicions, and rationally thought it was best to call the cops for our ""crime"" rather than minding his own business and moving on with his life.

&amp;#x200B;

After some research I found out a couple got jail time for the same things some months ago, which is absurd. What do you think about all this? Both about the application of such a law and the tunisian mentality disturbed by seeing an act of love but not batting an eye when seeing the hundreds of issues we got in our country.",,,,,,2018-09-30 07:37:25

1- Not looking for the latest 4k models, a full HD smooth display is quite enough.

2- As per Tayara, Xbox One is around 500 TND, PS4 starting 700 TND

3- My main games would be online, primary War Thunder, other two main games would be: Far Cry 5, Fall out 3 and plus.

4- I'm intending to purchase authentic games, I won't be using any hardware for this one.

5- I own an upgraded and patched (Freestyle) Xbox 360 for over 5 years now.

6- Streaming can be a plus but not really the main use of the thing, I have a netflix account.

7- Big fan of emulation (Atari, SNES, etc..)

We are currently researching to learn more in the lead up to our visit and I thought maybe you could give us some advice. When you google where to visit it pretty much tells you carthage and star wars sets. 

But what are your favourite places? Where do you feel that magic of Tunisia strongly? Where are the most interesting, beautiful, meaningful or just REAL, with all the good and bad that represents your complex lives?

There are infinite subtleties in every culture and in two weeks we might only scratch the surface but i want to be really immersed.

So, with the whole country to choose from - how would you introduce someone to tunisia in the most honest representitive map? 

What do you love or hate about Tunisia?

What is the most interesting or important part of your history to you?

How would you describe the nuances of your life that are typical to your country?

What are your favourite foods and where are your favourite cafes ect to eat them?

What do you do for fun?


Dont want to get stuck in tourist traps and just getting lost we will have an adventure but i think its also very obvious idea to ask the perspective of the people who are actually from there.

If you can answer any part of this or even something totally different i will be very greatful :)",,,,,,2018-11-14 10:11:37

Souad Abderrahim is the first woman to be elected mayor of a capital city in the Arab world.  Tunisia is regarded as a relatively progressive country in terms of women's rights and gender equality. However, the country is still deeply influenced by patriarchal structures. The transformation of Tunisia since the Arab Spring has progressed slowly. The country -- and in particular the capital -- still faces huge social and economic challenges. And many Tunisians are doubtful whether Abderrahim will be able to solve these problems. Shortly after her election, her opponents went on the attack. Some called into question whether a woman was up to the job. Others said she was being instrumentalized by the conservative and Muslim Ennahda Party, whose list she ran on.

(I'm mostly interested in all the different kinds of architecture and ruins you can find around.) Also, if I got any of the infos on transportation wrong, please let me know.

1) Tunis - half-day-trips to Bizerte (louage?) and Sidi Bou Said / Carthage

2) Tozeur (by train or bus from tunis?) + Chebika/Tamerza/Mides, if there's any tours or louages

3) Gabes, from there louages (?) to Matmata (and if possible Tamezret), Tatouine (and if possible Douiret / Chenini)

4) route back over Sfax, El Jem, Sousse, Monastir, Hammamet

5) sidetrack from Sousse to Kairouan (louage?) and from there to Sufutela (louage?)

6) final daytrip from Tunis to Dougga and/or El Kef (louage?)",,,,,,2018-12-09 23:42:37

a6k8ri,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/a6k8ri/,10,Just wanted to share an episode of our history that is rarely talked about .,"The Mejba revolt was a tunisian revolt against the ottoman bey who raised taxes to pay European debts , in this revolt the entire country was devestated , plagues and famines were very common .

&gt; *Dead bodies lay in the roads, unburied. They were collected every morning in the* *caravanserais* *and the mosques, and heaped in carts. Bubonic plague and typhus combined; this new scourge caused such ravages that there were two hundred new victims each day in the town of Sousse alone. Already, when there was only famine to contend with, Europeans did not dare leave their houses, for fear of encountering people wandering in the street, emaciated, whom despair might push to commit some awful crime. In the countryside, caravans were stopped and pillaged. The admirable soil of the Sahel itself was not spared: owners cut down their olive trees, their future fortune, to sell as firewood, rather than pay the endless taxes which were laid upon them. In the* *Djerid, many date-palm owners did likewise. Whoever tried to work and produce simply ended up paying taxes for those who now owned nothing*   
&gt;  
&gt; *The famine of 1867 all but emptied* *Thala, Tunisia,* *Kalaat Senan,* *Zouarine* *and* *Ebba* *and reduced the population of towns like El Kef and Téboursouk significantly. Zouarine, said by* *Victor Guérin* *to have 250-300 souls, was abandoned after the attacks of Fraichiche bedouin driven by hunger, and not repopulated until the eve of the* *Protectorate* *on the initiative of the governor of El Kef, Si Rachid. At* *Ebba, want compelled most owners to sell their houses and gardens to their sheikh, Kader, who let them fall down or become overgrown with weeds* 

Considering my father is from the Djerid and mother is from the Sahel , it sometimes makes me sad to read about this .",,,,,,2018-12-15 23:56:08

I should mention that a ton of taxi drivers I encountered were very pleasant and friendly, but my concerns still touch on a big portion of them. What annoys me the most is when : 

* They flat out ignore you even though they don't have a client at the time. If you don't want to work then just remove the thingy above your car so we can know.

* You actually find one and they ask you where you want to go, and they refuse to bring you there. I can understand that it may happen to someone to have a valid reason to do that but this happens way too often to my liking. Taxis refusing fares is illegal in Tunisia, but it is hardly enforced so they don't care. [Source 1](https://www.tekiano.com/2014/12/17/tunisie-150-dt-damende-pour-un-taxiste-ayant-refuse-dembarquer-une-cliente/) [and 2
](https://www.baya.tn/rubriques/society/societe/tunisie-taxi-il-refuse-de-lemmener-elle-sort-son-arme-de-son-sac-a-main/)

* When they arbitrarily choose clients, like when you call him up first and he chooses to ignore you to pick up the lady standing 15m behind you. I know that they have all the rights to do that but this happens way too often to me for some reason which is annoying, and I got the habit of avoiding places where people are already looking for a taxi because of it.

* They don't use proper equipment, we can barely see if you have a client at night without the green/red light.

* When they try to scam you, especially at the airport. No need to add much details about this, all travel agencies warn travelers about Taxi scams in Tunisia, embarrassing. You can [call the 1876 for free](https://www.huffpostmaghreb.com/2015/12/29/taxi-tunisie-arnaques_n_8889288.html) when it happens, but I'm not sure if it still works that way.

Some things we also need is more taxi stations in general for people like me that have a bad history with taxis, and many bus/train stations do not have taxis waiting there which is weird.

I'm puzzled when I see taxi drivers striking, like you know maybe do your job correctly first before complaining, but sadly that line should not just be addressed to them but most Tunisian workers in general.",,,,,,2018-12-27 17:34:13
