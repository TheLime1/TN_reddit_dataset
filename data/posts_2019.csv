## A man dies and goes to hell. Once there, he finds that there is a different hell for each country, so he tries to seek out the least painful one.

At the door to German Hell, he is told: ""First they put you in an electric chair for an hour. Then they lay you on a bed of nails for another hour. Then the German devil comes in and whips you for the rest of the day.""

He does not like the sound of that, so he checks out American Hell, Russian Hell and many more. They are all similarly gruesome. However, at Tunisian Hell a long line of people is waiting to get in. Amazed, he asks, ""What do they do here?""

He is told: ""First they put you in an electric chair for an hour. Then they lay you on a bed of nails for another hour. Then the Tunisian devil comes in and whips you for the rest of the day.""

""But that's the same as the others,"" says the man. ""Why are so many people waiting to get in?""

""Because of the power cuts, the electric chair does not work. The nails were paid for but never supplied, so the bed is comfortable. And the Tunisian devil used to be a civil servant, so he comes in, signs his time sheet and goes back home for private business.""

Long story short, he won the **first prize** (I am honestly happy for him) in a hackathon organized by [Dorahacks](https://twitter.com/dorahacks?lang=fr) in San Fransico (**USA**) in the field of **cybersecurity**. [source](https://www.huffpostmaghreb.com/entry/laureat-dune-competition-internationale-aux-etats-unis-le-jeune-tunisien-bilel-ali-fait-le-buzz-sur-les-reseaux-sociaux_mg_5c484a63e4b083c46d640c3b)

1st tunisian? nope just Media are intrested as usual with little **amazing abnormal** stories with a prodigy background (you remember the bakery guy from Paris right ?)

**What is DoraHack ?**

DoraHacks is the largest hackathon organizer and hacker community in China, expanding to 10 countries  in 2018. Over three years, DoraHacks has organized more than 100  hackathons globally, operating in 7 cities, 5000+ core hackers and 200k+  developers in community. DoraHacks has produced more than 1000  applications in its hackathons and incubated more than 20 successful  startups (including blockchains) in China.

**Did he really participate ?**

In 2018, many hackatons were organized by Dorahack (over a hunderd). So if you want to look for the event on google it will be a pain in the ass... but... you can always find somethink:

* DoraHacks US 2018: january @Sanfrancisco, june @San Jose (california), octobre @Oxford

\-&gt; Where did our friend go ? from this [image](https://pic.dorahacks.com/201811/27085637/3lneo4mtr6a3cyfd.png), it seems he was in Tokyo (novembre @Japan) !

**Did he really won ?**

Yes but his friend Luke says it's only the second place: [tweet](https://twitter.com/lukeisontheroad/status/1061491940036829186)

**Is it a big deal ?**

nah. Too few people have participated not a very special [event](https://dorahacks-tokyo.peatix.com/). So is it worth the fuzz ? you tell me.

**Correction:**

 Long story short, he won the **~~first~~** **second prize** in a hackathon organized by [Dorahacks](https://twitter.com/dorahacks?lang=fr) in ~~San Fransico (~~**~~USA~~**~~)~~ Tokyo (Japan) about **~~cybersecurity~~** the blockchain tech.

There was a similar question asked in the Algeria subreddit recently, and the response was that 23andMe is no good (doesn't separate Arab vs Berber DNA?) and Ancestry is the best.

The wedding is in Tunis and has 3 days of events. Some of these events are evening only, so we'll have the day to explore.

Any advice on what to expect during the wedding? How fancy should I dress? (I am female) Do I have to wear something different on each day or can I wear the same thing? I love the traditional Tunisian dresses, how much would it cost to buy one while I'm there? Are there any customs/traditions/ etc. I should know of? 

Also, will I have time to explore places other than Tunis/Carthage in the remaining 7 days? What would you recommend that I do? I like historical landmarks, cool landscapes, food, music, friendly locals, etc. Not too keen on the resort/beach thing. I'd would love to fit in a trip to the desert if possible, but if I don't have time I'd rather not rush things.

I think mods and redditors are open to new ideas, and I suggest for a beggining doing an automated weekly discussion thread, it is very enlightening and instructive when you get to share andectodes, recommandations, cultural events, music, books, deals, workshops, meet ups etc.. The sub official chat is interesting too but info and links get lost throughout the thread.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think or suggest?

* The government has no right to force me to go work in the provinces. Hospital are not well equipped there and I can't exercise my profession there. *so you prefer people to die? try and help with the best you can. If there are no doctors there they'll have no reason to upgrade hospitals*
* My salary is not good enough. I spent 11 years and I'm la crème de la crème. I deserve a higher salary. *bitch did you check the salary of an average engineer? the salary of professors? you think you're better than everybody else don't you? besides, you can always open an office and evade tax like your ""confrères"" do*
* Doctors make mistakes, you can't blame them for their mistakes. We work 72h no stop, why do you expect. We need more vacations and help in hospitals. *Didn't you know that when you applied for medical studies? and sorry bitch boy you have to assume your mistakes like everybody*
*  Doctors need to stand for each other and protect each other even when they make mistakes. If we don't who will? Yeah, did you see an average man/woman that says doctors are evil?

No reaction from world leaders.

I'm going to be in Tunis near Le Passage for work for a few days and I was wondering how to get some training in so I don't fall behind. I've been to Tunis for work before but running on the sidewalks didn't really seem like a thing that people do. Are there any gyms with treadmills near Le Passage where I could get a day pass for a few dinar? Would it be weird for me to just run on the sidewalk in the early evening?

Yesterday, I learned that I'll be moving to Tunisia for three months for my studies (I'm doing doctoral research at the Bibliothèque Nationale and the Archives Nationales), from May 1st to July 31st.  Right now, I'm looking for an apartment and am having some trouble.  I'm currently looking for an apartment, but I'm having trouble with Tunisie-Annonce.  Many of the posters on there do not have WhatsApp, and the website keeps timing out when I try to register, so it's impossible for me to send a message.  I'm looking to live in Ennasr, El Manar, or El Menzah.  I'll be working through an institute based in Menzah 5, so these would be good areas, and they aren't too far from government buildings.  Does anyone know of anybody who is looking to sub-let an apartment or anything?  Ideally, it would be furnished, but I really can work with anything.

English is my native language, my spoken French is adequate (I'm much better with reading/writing), and my Arabic (only Fosha) is weak, although it does exist.

In addition, is there anything else I should know before coming?  I did visit last year, but I'd be happy to read any advice that you may have to offer.

Thank you in advance!",,,,,,2019-03-31 01:39:31

 Dribbble Meetups are a chance for designers to socialize, talk shop, and foster their local design communities.

Dribbble is a community of web designers, graphic designers, illustrators, icon artists, typographers, logo designers, and other creative types that share small screenshots (shots) that show their work, process, and current projects. Dribbble is a place to show and tell, promote, discover, and explore design.

We are happy to invite you to the 1st ever Dribbble Tunis meetup April 16 from 6pm though 8pm in Level 1 (berges du lac)

Given the large number of amazing Tunis designers doing awesome work, we thought it was about time to organize this group by simply filling in this registration form: https://goo.gl/forms/XvSZq1yKJFtl71P92

If you are (or want to be) a designer, this group/meetups are for you. You'll get a unique chance to share your experiences and learn from other designers!",,,,,,2019-04-05 15:13:45

someone (not tunisian) suggested these earbuds to me [https://www.waverlylabs.com/](https://www.waverlylabs.com/)  but they warned me they are not great with dialects in general, but i am willign to try that, or anything else!!

&amp;#x200B;

i am wondering if you have any apps or devices you think are good? and yes i will definitely work on learning the tunisian dialect, i do not want them to have to learn a word of english!

&amp;#x200B;

So I have a bit of a cultural (I think) question. I (female) live in France where normally in a workplace we do ""la bise"" when greeting each other. I have a new Tunisian co-worker who shakes hands with everyone (which is totally fine). What's strange to me though is that he doesn't do a normal handshake with the women, he kind of does a quick limp shake where he doesn't take my hand, but rather puts his thumb on his palm (so I end up just incircling his hand with mine rather than having our thumbs around each others' hands like in a normal handshake) and he quickly pulls his hand away. I asked a couple of other co-workers and the male ones said he shakes normally with them. Is he uncomfortable shaking hands with women? Is it a cultural thing? I feel like it pains him to do it. I don't mind any kind of greeting, but it's just super awkward every time.",,,,,,2019-04-20 11:00:09

The Tunisian embassy can't give me clear advice. Most people just enter and leave ever three months for the 9 months of the school year.

I said I bet it was a cigarette from a worker. I said it when the fire was still burning. We were in Paris in February and visited the cathedral so I knew that the spire was under construction. And I know that half of Paris smokes. They smoke everywhere. So of course, it seemed obvious to me that probably the workers were smoking all the time in the construction areas with nobody stopping them. And I think I was right because the construction company admitted their workers were smoking there but they say that didn't start the fire. Um, why not? I think it did but I think it can never be proved.

Of course, with the current government, nothing good is gonna happen but i'm an optimist, i believe that we will have a reliable government, even if not soon and so i think that one of the priorities of that reliable government should be the military, we have to defend ourselves from all dangers

I am socially weird. I'm naive and an open book. A lot of people in Tunisia have taken me for granted and it's helped me grow thick skin for which I am thankful. I never tried to fuck someone over so when it happens to me, I am gutted at not being able to predict and avoid it. Nonetheless, I've vetted some adequate people and built a circle of friends around me and I can say that I feel fine and not without company in Tunisia.

However, I wanted to ask a simple question on this sub: do you (Tunisians and foreigners) have any good, meaningful friendships with Libyans?

Be it with a girl or with a guy, I have behaved the same way that I behave with people of all nationalities but the clique that loiters around Tunisia seem to always cause problems for me - they seem to have negative opinions of me which I learn from mutual, non-Libyan friends. They seem very fake to me to the point where I can't tell they're going to stab me in the back until they do.

There's the joke about Libyans being dumb - perhaps - but I have cousins who grew up on farms and while they may not be able to read or write properly, they're still adequate people. Being dumb does not mean being a piece of shit.

Did the war fuck with their heads? Are Libyans materialistic? Do they have some shitty force field (lol) that pushes them away from good people?

&amp;#x200B;

Although I will try to keep this post to the point, my apologies if it does end up being too long and a big thank you to all of those you that take the time to read this.

&amp;#x200B;

So essentially I used to live in Egypt for 11 years, I grew up there, but I am a European national. Everything was normal until I was one year away from heading off to Uni abroad, which was when my step father and mother began going through a pretty ugly divorce, by the time I left Egypt for Uni things were stable, but not great. Either way though by about my first into Uni, outside of Egypt, things got really bad and  both my mother and sister were forced to leave back to Europe. I was not involved in the process at all as it had to happen anyhow rather rapidly. In consequence, to all of these developments, I am pretty certain that my step father, back in Egypt, in retaliation to my mother probably sued the living hell out of her and filed a report in her absence.

&amp;#x200B;

So this brings me to my question which actually relates to the Tunisia Reddit, I will have to soon travel to Tunisia for some work and I am quite frankly worried endless that there could  be slim possibility that i could be arrested and extradited upon arrival, because my step father might have filed as well a report of some sorts on my name out of revenge as well in my absence even though I was out of Egypt by the time my mother left for about a year and I did not enter the country during that period. 

&amp;#x200B;

So without rambling much further on, is it possible to be extradited from Tunisia to Egypt as a third party national just like that if there is an ongoing court proceeding in Egypt? And if so, does this happen by explicit request from Egypt aka Egypt would have to know my presence in the country beforehand or are people just added to some wholesale list of people that should be caught upon entering Tunisia by default? Also, do you maybe have some other noteworthy advice for my situation?

&amp;#x200B;

I was at Sidi Bou Said today, and there was a lot of harassment.  I was called ""Ching Chang Chong"", had monkey and small-eye imitations made towards me, and a bunch of children kept harrasing me for money at the station to Tunis.

I know not all Tunisians are like this (like the stationmaster at Sidi Bou Said personally made sure I got on the train safely), but is it generally safe for an Asian to travel in Tunisia on trains, especially overnight ones, without being harassed?

Hi everyone ! I'd have a small question to ask for some work I'm doing. From my own research, I have found that Arabic is the main education language in Tunisia, except in the technical, scientific and mathematic fields (where it's French). However, while reading secondary schoolbooks from the language arts section, I found out they don't really look like books for French as a foreign language. Moreover, I also found a book for Chinese, with Chinese texts and translations in French, but not in Arabic...
So, I was wondering if some Tunisians could give me more information about that.

So here are generally speaking my stances on things.

I'm for;  
The modernization of the institutions through technology,  
A somewhat secular state,  
The legalization of weed,  
Freedom of speech,  
Fight against corruption  

I'm against;  
Privatisation of major industries, like transport, energy, natural resources, etc.  
Too many people of Ben Ali being in the gov,  
Too many military or police men being in the gov,  
The selling of land to foreign investors  
Wahhabism  

I hope you can help me on the search of finding a fitting political party for my stances.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a Psychology student from Germany and I'm currently working on my master's thesis on organ donation behavior.

At the moment, I am trying to learn more about how organ donation works in Tunisia, or more specifically, how you can become an organ donor. I read that Tunisia operates presumed consent legislation, so you have to opt-out if you don't want to donate your organs.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you know since when this law applies? I know that the most recent law on organ donation is from 2004, but was Tunisia an opt-out country before that? And do you know how much say the family of a deceased person has in the decision?

&amp;#x200B;

I really put in a lot of research to answer this question, however, so far, I couldn't find any reliable sources!

Thank you very much for your help!",,,,,,2019-07-01 14:37:26

The foreign guys here that have married Tunisian women: do you not get tired of Tunisia? Bored, uncomfortable, feel unsafe? I feel a bit of all of the above *sometimes* but even if I were to sink into the abyss, I'd rather it be in Tunisia, than say, the UK, US or mainland Europe.

Are you here temporarily? Until the kids come? Saving up for something?

And for the Tunisian men with foreign wives: why would you stay in Tunisia and what made your foreign wife pick Tunisia over her more prosperous place of abode?

I've been in my apartment to which the samsar said the electricity would cost no more than 20€ a month for. This was October 31st (when I began a 12 month contract). I got a bill at the end of November for 300-something dinars and was already pissed off as the bill was from August. My rent is 950pm so a monthly rent every three months just for using electricity is insane.

I didn't pay the STEG and never planned on it (contract said utilities are on the owner of the apartment, out of the goodness of my heart I was willing to pay it but not at some daylight rape tariff) but the landlord is now being a dick and threatening police action as well as not allowing me access to the property (I lost my key and asked him, a week in advance of my arrival to stash a key near the door).

The lighting for the building was hooked up to my counter (still is) and I don't think that 2000 dinars is possible even with two rolling chaumages baking 24/7 during the winter and with the building lights being activated for 60 secs at a time a couple of times in a day.

How can I get STEG to recount my usage and reduce the tarrif? Can the electricity of other houses be added onto one fattura addressed to the address I live at? Might it be for other houses?

We have agreed upon the following itinerary

Day 1: Tunis medina, avenue bourguiba, zaytouna mosk, bardo museum

Day 2: Carthage, sidi bousaid, shoud we add la marsa? 

Day 3: day trip to Haouaria from Tunis, possibly pass by Korbous if there are things to see? and back to tunis.

Day 4: go to El Jem, then to Monastir (if time allows it), then spend night in Sousse.

Day5: spend day in sousse, evening go to Hammamet and spend the night.

Days 6: enjoy Hammamet and spend the night.

Day7: go to Tunis from Hammamet, plane takes off at 6pm. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Are there any things to add or change? We though about going to Djerba but it's too far away apaprently.

Will we have any problems booking one shared room because of the gender factor?

Should we prefer the train to taxis? 

Any other tips are welcome, thank you very much!

we're looking forward to visiting your beautiful city.",,,,,,2019-07-19 15:16:53

 a president of your choice will lead it to a bright future.

Surely we're separated by borders, but we're shaken by whatever happens to our neighbors, especially Tunisia. We love it, and we wish only the best for it. Inchallah, all will go down the route of freedom, as you deserve.

&amp;#x200B;

It's worth mentioning that our supposed ""representatives"" have not sent their condolences, or at least, I have yet to see it myself. It saddens me, this clear lack of representation, but rest assured that we care! We've yet to put ones who will truly speak on our behalf, and say what we wish to say...it'll take time, but hopefully, we will!

I’m an American (42F) who spent a summer in Tunisia in 1997 at an archeological dig in a suburb of Tunis.  It was honestly one of the best experiences of my life! 

I’ve been thinking about the food lately. When I was there, we hired a Tunisian cook, who prepared the most delicious meals, and we indulged in local restaurants. I had so much good food. 

I have been sad that there aren’t many U.S. restaurants with Tunisian food. Some Moroccan restaurants have similar flavors, but it’s not the same.

I’ve been expanding my cooking abilities. Can anyone recommend an authentic cookbook? I haven’t found anything in bookstores, and can’t really preview anything I see online.

And it’s a long shot, but does anyone know of a restaurant in the U.S. that serves authentic Tunisian food?",,,,,,2019-08-02 00:35:12

I was in Turkey last year during Eid and I got trapped in a small town for over a week because everything was shut down with no free public transportation.

I’m kinda worried I’ll be losing a good portion of my trip to not being able to move around and find free space louage before during and after.

Thoughts on the limitations I’ll face? I’m starting in Tunis on the seventh, and I hope to spend a good portion of my time in the mid/south.",,,,,,2019-08-02 10:42:15

So why many people make a link between beard and terrorists?? I've got rejected from many job applications just because of the beard. Do I have to look like an exact person and just follow an unnamed stereotype ? Is there a pattern to follow or what?

Were they persecuted as a minority? Or just ignored? 
I know the constitution came years later and had to be biased by whatever majority was ruling at that time.

EDIT: I'm asking because I grew up in a very anti-semetic countryside where the arabic word for jew (يهوديّ) was used as a slur even by my father. I never really bought the narrative because I couldn't hate someone or something I didn't know. I assume the sentiment was such because of the Israeli-Palestinian/Arab conflict as my father later on when I grew up and could ask questions like what's up with jews he justifies it by ""them having responsibility over their government and aren't innocent of the crimes the government is committing"". 
So I wanted to know if this provoked repercussions even for Tunisian Jews being fellow countrymen and having essentially nothing to do with the conflict afaik.",,,,,,2019-08-19 08:53:55

We were thinking of (helping) to buy an apartment for her, this would be somewhere in Rades/Ezzahra/Hammam-Lif.

I'm looking for some advice how to proceed (if at all), and where to best solicit any professional advice (preferably in English but French is acceptable too).

* Are there any good websites that list property online to get an idea about prices/possibilities? I would guess around 150k-200k TND? It needs to be accessible on ground level or with an elevator.
* Can a non-Tunisian (or non-resident) own any property in Tunisia or does this require special paperwork? Or can my wife be the only owner?
* Does transferring money to Tunisia to buy the property incur any fees? Likewise, if we were to ever sell it, is it possible to transfer out the money?

cxz4fx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/cxz4fx/,5,Dashcam almost got me arrested in Tunisia,"This story happened on sep 2015. I wrote this few days later but want to share it now on this sub.
The names are changed.

You guys are very familiar with the dashboard cameras used by the Russians to film every trip they do by cars. Although they used it mostly for insurance purposes but when driving cool stuff happen, no?
I'm a big fan of these dash cam videos and I probably film every trip I make by car. Until recently I was arrested by a cop claiming I'm a terrorist...

It all started when my friend Alfred came to my house by car so that we go pick our friend François from city center. And we were supposed to go hang out afterwards after a long weeks of isolation. 
As always, I was filming the trip. Alfred and I were talking and singing. By the time we made it to city center. I decided to make a timelapse video. A video with fast motion like the ones you see in clips. 
I was filming the route when suddenly a cop pulled us over.  Alfred pulled over and I stopped the video that time. First, the cop demanded the paperwork then he asked me if I was filming. I acknowledged and then he asked if I had a permit for that. WTH?? A permit for filming? That time I started to think that problems are starting to grow up. Tunisian cops are known to be skeptical and so far away from the internet trends. He also demanded my phone and I had no choice but to give it to him. He actually didn't know how to open the recently filmed video. I had to show him how to do it. And frankly, I wasn’t bold enough to fool him. I was thinking that it might get me in bigger problems.
 He saw the fast motion video and asked why I'm filming the streets. I replied that that is a hobby and I like photographing random stuff in the streets. The policeman claimed that I'm intending to monitor movements of  police cars and I’m targeting some public buildings. I knew where he was going with this so I answered him: 

“ I know tunisia is in a state of emergency and i’m fully awared that terrorists are lurking in the shadows but, sir, the pattern of the video doesn't prove such a thing since this is just our route and I can't avoid buildings appearing in the video” 

Actually I was shocked by his reason. I mean the videos could barely show any clear buildings. It's a fast motion video for earth's sake. 

He was stubborn and requested that I wait for another officer to come to investigate with us. He kept saying that I need a permit to film in the streets. 
We stood in the car. We called our friend F telling him what happened. And few minutes he came. He climbed the car and there we greeted him with angst from what's coming next. Seriously I was thinking that time that the cop was wanting a bribe to let us go but had neither the cash nor the willing to do so. We clearly were not suspicious.

He came to the car and he requested our friends ID card.
We waited for nearly 30 minutes so that the other office come.

 He greeted us by shaking hands which is unusual for cops to do so. He climbed in our car and guided us to the police station. While on route, I explained everything to him. He said that I'm all right and it's because of precaution they are doing this. He also added that the traffic cops are suspecting everything these days and our case is just a joke. That  lifted some weight on my shoulders somehow. 

We arrived to the police station and sit there. They watched the videos and one of them clearly admitted that we are cool after he saw a video of us singing “We are not alone by Michael Jackson”.
 Honestly, we all were laughing at the videos. I could not hold myself especially where listening to Alfred yelling “I don't give a shit about this sorry country” in another video. And of course these cops did not understand English which was almost more that half of our conversations. 

Since I had no ID card, the cop with the computer started asking about my name, birthday and etc. He was typing a report. In that room was another cop sitting in the opposite corner staring at me.
He said that my hobby don’t match my field of study. And once again I was stunned by their reason.
Then he started to scare me and I knew he was trying to test my moral. That was a key of success by itself. The case is stupid and they just trying to stall it for no good reason.
He kept asking about our education, social life and both of my friend had beard grown up and these cops are just get so emotional when they see someone with a beard.

I remember that one of the cops. started to think about detaining us for 3 days and he was asking another cop if it was time to put handcuffs. That was an epic situation. He was willing to get rid of us by throwing us to the jail. 
Lucky for us the other cops just waved a no to him. And even if that cop was joking or whatever. That wasn’t funny at all. 
In this country which I did not choose to be born in, such a thing is very easy. Then he added that I’m too thin for handcuff so I just smiled. 

We kept waiting and waiting. A woman came with her 10 years old daughter to raise charges against a man beating both of them and I was really shocked how they treated her. They just wanted to ignore her at the beginning but the woman kept screaming and shouting till they decided to listen to her. The cop who was asking her question demanded if that guy had a beard or not. She clearly understood the trick and she said yes. I smiled at that.
 If you want to be a terrorist, you have to grow a beard to distinguish yourself. that’s their logic.
That woman needed help and they just scammed her.

By 21:30 the chief of the police station came, sit in desk in front of us and asked: “ Is there terrorism in this country ?” 
_ What happen to this country during this year is beyond enough. I replied.
_ Where are the terrorists? “ We frowned at that and we said:
_ Terrorist can be anywhere, they just don’t have one specific  place.
_ What happened to terrorists that were detained ?
_ They are in the prison, F replied

He said “ Are you sure about that ? Do you know that the court set them free ? We know these terrorists. And because of human rights organisations things are becoming hard for our job ?”

He made his point very clear and we didn’t want to argue with him about this subject especially in our situations and the possible charges that could raised against us.

The cop who was writing the report said to us “ Before, we bring suspicious guys hit them till they speak. And lucky for you guys we don’t do it anymore because of human rights” he added “Today, we are cool with detainees and we should have serve you something to eat or drink. We apologise for the long time we kept you waiting here and trust me, this night could have been a nightmare for you in another time” That was freezing me.

 The other cop who was staring at me and talking about handcuffs said that we are serene. He also added that since we were laughing at the beginning that means that we are good.

After 10 minutes he gave us back our ID card and my phone as well. And that night was over.
We were wanting to go hang out so we did it in a police station.

I told this story to some couple guys and just said that i sould have not film the streets and I have no good reason for that. “ You film a landscape, a person but why you are filing streets?” That means that citizens of this country are so ready to drop down their rights for security and they are not awared that authorities are not just like they expect. This will lead them to lose both.

If I were a cop I would have investigate the matter. But I would have not stick too long for a hopeless case. However, I would be more concerned about that woman and her poor little daughter.

That night highlighted that thin line between freedom and security. It also demonstrated how an innocent move can lead you to be very suspicious. I will NOT stop filming streets and the trips. I will be cautious about it.
I really dislike this country now. Not because of the cops, but because of those claiming cops did the right thing.",,,,,,2019-08-31 18:47:57

I'm female student who must take one bus two metro to my university where it takes me at least 1h30 to arrive if the transportation that day was great. I'm already struggling with packed buses and metros with delayed time and potential harrassment where u shouldn't speak out about. I'm so sick and tired all I want is to study and go to university in peace is that too much to ask? Anyway I just want to ask what advice do u guys have on how to protect myself ??I know that pepper spray is illegal and I don't have access to it or I just don't know where I can buy it 🙁 is there any street safety rules that u may know ? 
It's been too much recently here in Tunisia, I just don't understand struggling from unemployment doesn't give u the right to kill or harass other people, we are all trying our best to go through these tough times . Its crazy what's happening and u shouldn't accept it as ""fate"" or part of ""democracy changes"" , the country is full of useless politicians who has absolutely no idea what they're doing and people who misunderstand democracy as a miracle to magically make them rich , this is just the start we have to fight and work very hard, we have to sacrifice a lot and all of that is not enough for the development of this beautiful land.
I'm sorry for my kinda depressive rant , I tried to stay hopeful many times but this time it's too much.
I hope my next post will be something positive because no matter how many times I'm disappointed, deep down I really love this country and it hurts when she cries.",,,,,,2019-09-01 13:33:32
cybny6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/cybny6/,5,so i (male) just remembered the TWO times i got threatened with a pocket knife in Middle school,"* first time, was in 7th grade where a kid threatened (slashing my uniform from the back) me for tearing a button from his uniform (happened outside), in the middle of class, told the teacher and all she does is take the knife away...this kid has bullied me for around 5 bloody years.  in the end he doesn't get any punishment

&amp;#x200B;

* second time, was in 8th, it was the the end of the year, arabic teacher said we'd have an extra class before exams on saturday afternoon, there were only two janitors in the whole school at that time (+12 students from my class), so this one kid (not the same kid as the first time) who lives in my neighborhood, approaches me (no one saw him somehow) with a hobby knife and tries to scare me with it then he starts shoving the knife in my way (i actually had to dodge it), that's when the teacher came and this kid went back to class LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED, i stayed outside because i was genuinely traumatized and didn't know how to react, when the class ended the teacher saw me outside so i had to explain why i was, then he tells me why i didn't tell her earlier etc, he tells the other kids to bring the attacker which makes a huge fuss (i hate being in the middle of attention), the attacker plays it off as playing and that the knife was fake (why would anyone have a fake knife?), long story short he only gets lectured without any punishment and *mind you,* this kid already has a dirty record, we went to the principal and he didn't do shit because it was exam season. my father went to this kid's house and they just denied everything while the kid was lying behind them (i say something, he says it didn't happen).

this is just a part of me being bullied by short people, yes, only short people, at that time i was taller than everyone and bit fat. all my bullies (5 in middle school alone) were short, and 2 of them were freaking girls (thots that wear makeup and are assholes only to me). in the end my non-caring behavior got them uninterested ^(mostly)

I'll be visiting Tunisia for a week in early September, and there's not a huge amount of recent information on the internet lately, especially if you don't plan to stay in a resort.

I'm splitting my time between Sousse (day trips to Kairouan, Monastir and El Jem) and Tunis (day trips to Carthage and Sidi Bou Said).

I'm planning on eating at the guesthouses I'm staying at, as they're both owned by local women who can provide meals, and the reviews look great for the food. Beyond that, is there anything you'd recommend I try? I love harissa, and tagine-style meals, along with grilled meat and seafood, is there anything that really stands out at this time of year?

I also have a sweet tooth, so if there are any dessert/sweet things/fruit you'd recommend, I'd be so happy to hear about that. I'm also a massive fan of dates (the dried kind) - are they in season at the moment? 

I'll be landing in Endifha Airport, because there were so few flights to Tunis. What would be a reasonable price for a taxi from the airport to Sousse? I've emailed the guesthouse owner to ask, but she hasn't come back to me yet, and I'm not sure how active on email they are.

But following tunisian media i dont hear much although its a very serious and existential threat for us and especially the future generations. There are several different studies predicting that the mediterranean region will be suffering the most. Already today we have big problems with aridity and desertification. The University Aix-Marseille for example is predicting tunisia to be a desert in 2100. And its likely to be earlier when we see worldleaders like Trump, Bolsonaro and other not giving a f*** about this planet. Im really worried that we will react too late and i dont want to see future generations in a civil war because they cant grow enough food to eat. I think our only hope is the sun, free energy. In theory 90 000 km2 desert is enough to provide energy to the whole world. Tunisia alone could provide half europe with electricity. But the the solar thermal power plants have to be 100% MADE IN TUNISIA. It would be a huge investment to solve all this problems plus creating thousands of jobs. We are a rich country! But i dont hear much of that even during the presidential debates.

d0uyhw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/d0uyhw/,6,[Rant] why's the university registration procedure so tedious and confusing?,"you have to pay 70dt to make a student card, so you have to use a specific card (edinar jeune) and they don't accept regular edinar cards so you have to pay for a card you'll most likely never use again.

&amp;#x200B;

you have to refill info they already know. in the bac website i just input my social number and my bac number and a password they sent me. now i see my name,university,birth date, profession ect. in the inscription site i have to write my name and other info i sent when i made the account there(in which they generate a random password and send it plaintext to my email, yeah great security there) not to mention my name is literally on top of the page of the form (i had to write it twice in different forms). they have half if not most of the info they need on me, so why do i have to go to multiple places to get documents, just to give them to another to get another document i need to give along with other documents to my university?

&amp;#x200B;

need pictures? sure take the one from my identity card, no need for me to upload it or give 4 copies to my university. you already know everything about my parents and siblings along with their identity numbers and jobs.

most of these steps are very pointless, we have internet, my university should be able to get the necessary info. this isn't 1995. make it an easy and a one time quick payment. i've lost count on how many times  i had to extract/print/pay for.

I needed to say this. i know not many people will see this. and i doubt anything will change. this just seems to a deliberate procedure to get as much money as possible while wasting everyone's time and money.",,,,,,2019-09-07 11:40:13

And as mentioned by some of you that these data could be biased because of the multiple vote feature. I analysed the data (timestamp and the vote) and located a pattern in them. This pattern where I see consecutive same vote in a very small intervals varying between 5 seconds and 18 seconds. 

These small interval imply that the same voter is re-voting again which is logical since 5 seconds is enough to refresh the page and click again. (18 seconds) may refer to a slower internet connection or the contestant is harder to locate to click. Hence, more time is needed.

I deleted the redundant consecutive votes but the first. And I believe that this method would improve the data.

1. A candidat who's financially corrupt, accused of tax evasion and fraud and other crimes, could be said to have used ""bribery"" to buy votes from naïve old people, and is currently arrested...
2. A candidat who's a religious faschist, believes in death penalty, polygamy, is against respecting the constitution and individual rights, against women rights, wants to mess up international relations... has relations with ""7esb ta7rir"" and is endorsed by ""Nahdha""...

I feel so disappointed and frustrated. I keep wondering, how did people in my generation, those who are younger than 25, vote like this?

I knew since weeks ago those two were popular, especially Kais on social media, but do people not see past facebook ads and videos? Kais presented himself to youngsters as the hero we need, for the nation's progress. Same with Karoui who presented himself as the hero of the poor and miserable. Do neither category of people realise that ""if it's too good to be true, it probably isn't""? That it's all part of a bigger plan. That each of those candidats is endorsed in secret? That no human is as perfect as these two make themselves out to be?

Am I the only one having a horrible gut feeling right now about our future?

I honestly just want to leave the country even more at this point. I'm tired of caring about this stuff...

I'll probably just go away, never come back and forget about all of this, and while waiting for my opportunity these years, try not to get in trouble with the new conservative regime...

I am though confused, sad and disappointed in my fellow Tunisian redditors who are voicing open support for Mr. Karoui. I fail to understand how one can support a dangerous criminal (yes he is innocent until proven guilty, but in our case his audio tapes are pretty incriminating and he didn't deny them. without mentioning the instrumentalisation of his TV for partisan support of other parties and himself).

How would one support a person that is clearly driven by personal greed rather than the well being of the nation, only because the other person might be a hint too much on the social conservative scale?!

Let's be clear, it would be extremely tough for President Said to break the law while it would very easy for President Karoui to break the law. On one hand we have multiple statements and actual behavior that guarantee Mr. Said will not break the law, while we have multiple statements and actions by Mr. Karoui that will guarantee he will break the law.

If you carefully follow Mr. Said's interventions, you would figure out easily that he is a extremely careful in wanting to operate within the legal framework of the constitution and the law. His few policy propositions (tough to implement without parliamentary block supporting him) would be still constitutionally legal.

I do understand though that some have issues with his position regarding homosexuality, marijuana and inheritance. But I do believe one has to prioritize the most dire issues that face our nation. Do you want a known crook who will further increase corruption, economic decline and very possibly dictatorship, but might decriminalize pot and homosexuality while establishing equal inheritance? Or do you want a known honest person that will abide by the law, fight corruption and try to establish a more egalitarian system, but might not change the status-co on homosexuality, pot and inheritance ?

What are your priorities ?",,,,,,2019-09-18 03:02:20

And yes I'm talking about Elhiwar Ettounsi, KS is showing hiw much he is against corruption and pre-revolution allies, knowing that Sami el Fehri is one of them, maybe he will never respond to the Tounes Alyaoum hungry calls to invite him and get to know the man.

In my own opinion, this dude is a total unknown to the 'System' and this confuses everyone including the occident who, as we know all, has to have a final touch on many gouvernment decisions including people's will. Now that KS has a big chance to win, he will be harrassed by many external parts using the media until he finally clarify himself politically and reveal if he's pro-islamists, a leftist or none.

Nabil Karoui was a legal candidate who respected the law. His candidacy was accepted by the Tunisian Independent Election Authority. He has been arrested and jailed right before the election. He has never been convicted of anything so far. The European Union is right to denounce this as a scandal. 

The Tunisian League of Human Rights is 100% right to denounce this.

I will be visiting Tunis for one week and I'm looking for a gym with proper squat/power rack for squatting like [this](https://www.roguefitness.com/rogue-rml-390bt-power-rack)

 (*not* a [smith machine](https://www.amazon.com/Valor-Fitness-Smith-Machine-BE-11/dp/B0026J8GPY)). Can anyone recommend anything in the area of Lac 1 or 2, La Marsa etc? 

I know that California Gym is a large one but, do they have a squat rack?

I would like to continue my strength training program during my stay, unfortunately most gyms i've seen are *full* of machines and treadmills.

Meanwhile, the previous generation even with a low level of education could do all that even before they hit their 30's.

I want to buy a used car (maybe a chery qq) which costs around 20 000 dt and is 2 years old.
At the same time it also costs the same brand new (19 999 dt). When I asked about why they told me it's because the chery qq is ""populaire"" and specific population can buy it with a long procedure.

I'm not eligible for this procedure since I'm a recent graduate and I wonder if I could buy this car from someone who just recently bought it.

So, can I buy a ""populaire"" car from someone who bought it in 2019 or is there a buffer time of no sell for these cars.

So my friend is not planning to take cannabis with him (or buy anything) and does not want to consume during his visit(1week).
So my question is wether he is in danger of getting a sentence since there is still thc leftovers in his blood and urine (normally takes atleast 3-4weeks after last consumption to completely vanish)?

So please vote. Every vote matters. Don't let other people, more ignorant, more hateful, more cynical, decide where they want to take Tunisia. A few parliamentary seats can make the difference between a good government and a bad government. I won't tell you who to vote for. But among candidates please vote for someone :

**1)** With Ethics and Values. You want someone that will not tolerate Government abuses of power and will expose them. Someone that will not abuse his powers if he obtains a Ministry. Someone that is ready to resign and attack his own political party if he sees things he finds morally unnaceptable. Someone that will always defend freedom of the press and always condemn political violence. 

**2)** Educated. Someone that can read, count, and write well. In multiple languages. Someone that has read many books or written books. Someone who knows how to think about complex issues.

**3)** With a vision. Someone that isn't running against other people or ideas. Someone that is running to implement ideas. It can be anything. A law to improve driving safety. New measures against smoking in public spaces. An initiative against pollution. You want someone who wants to get things done if he is elected but who will always have respect toward politicians who disagree with him.

Best of Luck.",,,,,,2019-10-05 15:08:51

**3)** Ban on advertising of sugar, tobacco and alcohol to improve public health.

**4)** Construction of a Tunisian Jewish History Museum in Jerba. Jews have a 4000 year history in Tunisia. This Museum will help attract every year thousands of tourists from Europe, America and Israel which will boost economic reserves and create jobs.

**5)** All Former Presidents of Tunisia are de facto members of The Tunisian Constitutional Court. All former Former Presidents of Tunisia have a right to a salary, 2 bodyguards, 1 secretary, and a driver. All former Prime Minister have the right to a salary, 1 bodyguard, and a driver. This will help facilitate transitions of powers.

**6)** Number of Members of Parliament is reduced from 217 to 180. Former Parliamentarian receive a salary for a period of 2 years to find a new job.

**7)** Priority is focused to improve the ranking of Doing Business. Tunisia is currently ranked 80. It must be the most competitive economy in Africa and be ranked at least 50.

6) POSITIVE: THE TURK WHO I HOPE MARRIES MY FRIEND  
7) POSITIVE: THE TUNISIAN NEIGHBOUR AND NOW ROOMMATE  
8) POSITIVE: THE TUNISIAN CLASSMATE

The title is pretty much self-explanatory right?

So hello there.  
My name's Manuel, I'm gay, I'm Jewish, and I'm an immigrant.  
But please, don't reduce me to just those 3 things, I am much more than that, but those 3 things are a huge part of my identity obviously.

Btw as for immigrant, I'm originally from Portugal and I live in Germany.

So, given the many incidents of antisemitism, islamophobia, anti-arabism, homophobia and so on that the media keeps showing us I wanted to share my personal interactions with Arabs and/or muslims, in real life, online and so on.

This is divided into ""incidents"" so first positive story:

1. POSITIVE: THE LEBANESE WHO CALLS ME HIS NEIGHBOUR

This one is actually fun. One day while walking around the town here in Germany, talking loudly in Spanish with a friend of mine, who I must describe as a beautiful woman who easily gets attention some guy made her laugh with an attempt to flirt by saying ""ciao bella"", she got so entertained she dropped her mobile phone on the floor, that was a fun sight to see.

We were on our way to a well known bar in town, and we had obviously mentioned its name.

As we walked away from the riverside to the bar, the man was nowhere to be seen, moments later, as we approach the bar, there he is!!!!

He clearly took a different path to the bar just to be able to find my friend.

For those of you who might find that creepy, ok I get it, but personally I consider it quite flatering and charming, and so did my friend. So it was all good.

He started speaking to me in German asking where we were going and if he could join us.  
We spoke for a bit and I explained to him that my friend could speak German even better than me.  
However I could tell she was nervous (she's a bit shy, as so am I) so I ended up making most of the conversation.

As we spoke he told me he was from Lebanon, however with his perfect German I had to ask if he was brought up here.

Yes, he was.

Quickly we switched to English (a language I feel much more comfortable with) once we realised we could also both speak it fluently.  
The man had an interesting life story and he was honestly very pleasant, I was wearing a kippah that day so I was being obviously Jewish, with my Jewishness on everybody's face.  
He thought I was from Israel at first, until I explained I am from Portugal actually, and have only been to Israel for holidays and such.

I liked the guy, he seemed nice, so I convinced my friend to let him join us.

""Let him come, if you like him great, if you don't like him then you'll just tell him and go home without him right? So what is the issue? Just give him a chance.""

As we sat down we discussed about a wide variety of topics, his previous marriage, his family life, what Lebanon is like, why his family came to Germany, the Lebanese Civil War and then the war with Israel.

Throughout the discussion of these controversial topics there was no sense of hatred between any of us (as I must again remind you, I'm not Israeli, therefore, those wars got nothing to do with me, and many Israeli people were not involved in it anyway).

He was super nice the whole time, we had fun, we drank together and talked, and I constantly tried to push him into going dancing with my friend (he can't dance well so he was nervous by now).

Thankfully I got him dancing with her and took a pic of the two together, it was sweet.

When we were discussing for so long the other friends who joined us asked how we could already be talking so much.

He answered ""oh of course, he's my neighbour"" (a reference to Israel's proximity to Lebanon, I may not be Israeli, but I understand that due to Israel being a Jewish land we're still associated with it)

I actually thought that was sweet of him.

He's a proud Lebanese muslim from a devout background (his mum wears hijab for example).

He's a patriot, and he would always stand by Lebanon, but he had no hatred for Jews and not even for Israel.

He was passed those moments, and he saw I was very pro-Lebanese, so that helped (I want Lebanon to get the Shebaa Farms and compensation for moral damage during the war for example).

I decided to leave early (I don't like partying nor drinking), as I am leaving he gives me a hug and even asks for my number so we can stay in touch.

After I was gone turns out he asked my friend if I was also interested in her

She answers ""Oh no, he's gay.""  
His reply ""What? Serious? He does not look like it!""

That made me laugh, I wonder if he imagined all gays as wearing high heels and walking half naked on the street.  
We are still in touch 'till this day.  
I write him messages during muslim festivals to wish him a pleasant time and he always remembers to call me ""ya sadiqi"".

We talk to eachother whenever the other one is down and we honestly view one another in a high regard.

2) NEGATIVE: THE ARABS WHO YELLED AT ME ON A BUSY STREET AND THOSE WHO DEFENDED THEM

A beautiful sunny day in Germany (though I'm not a fan of too much sun), so I am walking down one of the busiest streets in my city, I have my kippah on, I look visibly Jewish, walking with me is a muslim Turkish ""friend"" (or so I thought) when suddenly a group of Arabs in a car decide to drive by me and yell ""PALESTINA! PALESTINA!""

The message there was clear, I'm a Jew, therefore if Israel does something, I should be harrassed on the streets just because...

For comparison, try to imagine if a group of people followed you on the streets for every thing daesh does and then yelled ""EZIDI PEOPLE!!! MOSUL!!!! CHARLIE HEBDO!!!! BERLIN CHRISTMAS MARKET!!!"" etc...

Or if you are christian.. hmmm imagine you get called pedophiles cause of the catholic church or whatnot.

I yelled at them in the middle of the busy street (what? I'm Portuguese, we're not known for being quiet. Plus, I have some Moroccan ancestry and that Maghrebi blood sure as hell boils when convenient) ""f\*ck you! what's that gotta do with me? you got a problem a\*\*holes?!""

This while the men in the car laughed and gave me the finger.

The Turkish ""friend"" in the meantime who is almost hiding behind me is trying to pull me away accusing me of ""provoking"" them and not reacting well. Saying I should ignore them.

Sorry folks, my parents taught me better than to ignore injustice.

3) POSITIVE/NEGATIVE: THE IRAQI FRIENDS (ONLINE AND OFFLINE), AND THE SYRIAN-PALESTINIAN A\*\*HOLE

So, here in Germany I ended up going to something similar to classes let's say, once there I met a super nice Arab guy from Baghdad, who has German citizenship 'cause he has been here for around 5 or 6 years, and as a refugee he applied for nationality after enough time had passed, I also met a Syrian-Palestinian (Syrian dad, Palestinian mum) who was born in Saudi Arabia, but came to Germany as a baby and grew up here, therefore he speaks German as his mother tongue and is mostly German.

At first I thought both were good friends, turns out only the Iraqi was.

For details, the Iraqi guy loved me even more when he found out I was Jewish, he immediately mentioned to me how his neighbours were Jewish and nobody had an issue with them.

""Before America f\*cked up my country things were not perfect, but we were well. And we loved my neighbours, only a few extremists were antisemitic, in my neighbourhood all religions lived together and got along!""

In classes I tend to observe secularism (as a personal choice) and don't bring any conspicuous religious symbols, bringing only a small Star of David that I keep under my sweater.

But on ocasion on the street I do wear a Kippah or such, only sometimes though.

The Iraqi never trully cared, he even invited me to go out, took me to Arab restaurants and wanted to hang out.

The Syrian-Palestinian.. Well, we went out a few times, once though I brought my Kippah.

The next day I get a call from him asking if we could go out after class, but ""please Manuel, don't bring your Kippah.""

Me: Why?

Him: Look Manuel, I don't have any issues with Jews, really you know that, but it's best if people don't see me with a Jew, you know Arab people are sh\*t, they really are, they will make comments, ask my mum why I hang with a Jew.

Me: I am not being told to hide my identity, especially in Germany!

Him: I know but..

I hung up the phone on his face.

The next day I broke my own observance of secularism and went with my f\*cking Kippah to classes so he could stare at it the whole day.

(Fun fact, the Syrian-Palestinian has an aunt who lives in Haifa, Israel. She married an Israeli-Arab and moved with him, loooong before the Syrian war even started. She had no issues going to a land full of Jews and quite possibly has no hatred in her heart, choosing to go live in Israel instead of blaming its people for her refugee status in Syria)

I talk with the Iraqi about what happened.

Iraqi: Oh of course he'd do that, that guy's an a\*\*hole, you know the other day he got mad at me for talking to him in Arabic in a restaurant queue? And it was an Arab restaurant!!!

You see people, the Syrian/Palestinian looks very European, with a pale skin and red hair, he honestly looks Czech to me.

Seems he enjoy trying to hide his heritage when possible and doesn't want people to know he's Arab.

I confronted him about it after what the Iraqi told me. His reply: I am proud of looking European, and I don't need people to know I'm Arab, that's my private business!

So yeah.. A\*\*hole.

Also, online I met a super nice guy from Baghdad (there must be a factory of great people in this city), who is btw, awesome!  
He is like, super smart, interesting, sadly not gay but very handsome.  
We could talk all day about Politics, Geography, History, Culture.

Basically, he's a hardworking student who likes to meet new people and really knows how to strike up a conversation with smart topics.  
Very proud of his cultural background and very much into discussing anything, nothing is tabboo.

Sadly for his safety and privacy I will not speak details about him, but I think he deserved to be mentioned.

4) NEGATIVE: THE NAIVE GIRL IN CLASS AND THE JACKA\*\* / GETTING BANNED FROM ARABS REDDIT PAGE

So in my German classes there are 3 people from Syria (there were 4 but one of them got pregnant and moved with her husband to a new city, I wish her the best, she was a very sweet girl) 1 Arab from Damascus, one Kurd from Afrin and one Palestinian girl from.. no idea, maybe Damascus too? I don't know.

Anyway, in class we are doing a speaking exercise ""What would you do if you were the President of your homeland?""

Here's the thing, the Palestinian girl, is quite naive sadly, and not very good at German, in fact, she can barely manage to communicate, even if you pointed a gun to her head she'd not know how to talk, though I never realised that since we didn't interact much (now that I know she can't speak German I understand why).

Result, she can't read properly, she can't write a letter to someone or say what she thinks.

Well the Damascus guy who is a total jacka\*\* instead of helping her decided to instead trick her for ""fun"".

Her time to speak is up, she has to say something, but she obviously can't.

The Damascus guy being clearly so helpful (a\*\*hole!!!!) writes a small text for her to read.

Result, she says this basically: If I was the President of my homeland I would gather up all the Jews in one place and get rid of them""

The teacher, quite understandeably has a face that says it all..

The teacher asks ""Did you understand what you just said?""  
Girl: (nods her head with a big smile because she doesn't want to sound stupid)  
Teacher: Look, I need to explain to you, because what you just said actually is..  
Me yelling from my chair: ANA YAHUDI!

The girl has a big scared look on her face, and not at my announcement by the way, she knew I was Jewish from the start, as did all others, it was mentioned during my presentation to the class.

People were telling me ""Brother, she doesn't know what she said, trust me, this is not what she meant.""

Me: BUT DID YOU HEAR WHAT SHE JUST...  
Them: She needs to learn like all of us here...  
ME: THEN SHE WILL LEARN ONLY IF WE CORRECT HER

I'm quite mad at this point, the teacher diffuses the tension, for the rest of the class' duration the girl is looking at me very aprehensively.  
The teacher asks me to stay after class, talks with me, and explains this was a sick ""joke"" of the Damascus guy ""Trust me Manuel, I don't want you to be angry, but this is the sad truth, that girl can't speak anything, this was a very sick joke from that guy. Please, just try to forget and be stronger. I don't think there is a need to call the police, but if you wish we can.""

I sigh and move on, though the next day the guy didn't come to class, but the teacher had the door locked and asked the other Arabic speakers (over 80% of my class can speak Arabic) to explain what happened and makes a small speech against racism of any kind.

The teacher says the girl must apologise, but before she even speaks as she looks nervously at me I just say ""it's ok"".

The truth is, it's not her fault, and I felt very sorry for her at this point.

This negative story was not her doing, she was just an innocent victim too, and I felt bad about her being put into this situation, having to apologise for someone else's bullsh\*t, it didn't sound fair, and I'm still sad for her over that.

Btw: for everyone who might wonder, I hope that girl and every other Palestinian who so wishes for it may one day return to their lands, I'm a strong supporter of Israel's existence, but I don't support any occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.

I support an attempt at diplomacy first, war later.

With Gaza it will be difficult, but I believe there is a chance with the West Bank, and I am of the belief Arabs who once lived on what is now Israel should be allowed to return if it is established that they do not wish harm on the country or its people and should be given economic support to settle themselves in, I also believe the West Bank settlements should be dismantled, with the entire West Bank being under Palestinian control, though, should they try to attack Israel, then I'm all for an invasion as a response, provided Palestinians are spared from any bloodshed and are allowed to maintain their property and dignity, with their culture being preserved and no relocations or expulsions happening.

With a referendum on their future (such as them becoming a true republic with human rights and free from the Oslo accords, which in my opinion do not help the Palestinians at all since these accords have not stopped Palestinians from losing any more land nor have they prevented settler violence)

On another issue I got banned from Arabs reddit page for opposing antisemitism.

I'm sure some here can relate to their wonderful double standards though.

So Arabs, which has a rule against political posts or ""promotions of Zionism"" decided to ban me after I confronted someone for mocking the Hebrew language, and then in a message simply labeled me ""lost zionist"" and went on on how I spread ""zionist propaganda"" and write to me how ""people under occupation have enough to deal with"" and mute me from replying.

It all started with a post because an Israeli government troll decided to share on twitter images of Arab dishes and claim them as Israeli dishes.

Easy to triger people who apparently don't have bigger things to worry about other than who really owns a falafel or shakshouka, oh well.

I made it clear that I am Jew btw, just to make that clear from the start, in case anyone wanted to view me as biased, however I am not Israeli and feel no need to defend or explain the Israeli government, who I view honestly, as not my cup of tea.

Now, while I do oppose many of Israel's policies and accept criticism of Israel I don't accept blatant criticisms of Jewish identity (though criticisms of many aspects of the Jewish faith and the religion itself I do think are fine since ideas are not sacred for all people and we should be free to mock them).

Anyway, someone posts how ""Israelis to bring back their dead language also had to use Arabic""

The message here was very clear, Hebrew was unoriginal, they even said in other comments on the same thread how Hebrew was not original!

I ignored every single other comment criticising Israel, which I found meeeh, just political not hateful, but I immediately understood what they meant by that comment. It was mocking and belittling the language that Jews hold dearly in their traditions, it's ridiculing it, and calling it an imperfect knock-off of Arabic.

Anyways, so obviously I merely asked what was wrong with bringing Hebrew back from the dead and mention that Arabic also uses many words from Greek, English and French.

Many downvotes came and attacks against the language and Israel out of nowhere.

Result, I don't know why, but somehow, seeing these people behaving savagely because of their hatred to me defending simply a language, suddenly made me lash out, think about it, and argue.

So we ended up arguing about Israeli policies.

And yes, as a result of this argument I did have to defend Israeli policies when unfair accusations were made. Such as accusations of genocide which sorry folks, ain't happening there.

For starters I mentioned around 21% of Israeli citizens are Arabs who can vote and run for elections, how Israel has a free Arab media that freely criticises the government and so on.

Went on to ask where are the Jews who once lived in the MENA region outside of Israel.

I got accused of zionist propaganda by the moderators, and blocked from the group.

This despite that I did mention clearly that I:

1. Support a peaceful coexistence between Israel and Palestine
2. Want a two state-solution
3. Recognise both sides did attrocities
4. Let's not forget I ignored all purely political comments and went after only the comment that was outright just trying to attack ""Jewishness"".

But here's what happened:

Replies people gave were that Jews were foreigners in the area (let's ignore ancient Jewish temples there), that Israel would soon disappear, and some outright denied Jews suffered that much persecution in the MENA region and simply ""migrated"" to Palestine.

Some outright used personal insults and whatnot.

They also went on how they can treat their minorities as they wish cause those are THEIR LANDS (after I brought up Kurdistan and LGBT+ rights) with one even saying he doesn't support ""gay shit"".

So just to be clear, I did not start a post on zionism or Israel, but merely got involved after someone decided to insult the Hebrew language and then it went down into personal attacks.

Did these Historic revisionists revisionists get banned? No.

Did the people who called for the destruction and mass expulsions of an entire nation get expelled? No

I did.

Oh but at least I think the anti-gay guy also got expelled.

Anyway, I did message the mods and spoke my piece of mind.

I was told they could unblock me since it was my first ""failure"" but I could no longer post about ""zionism""

Anyone else can make political posts about Israel though, as long as mocking or belittling it or wanting it destroyed, that is fine, but any attempt at giving a different oppinion is ""zionist propaganda"" therefore I can't.

I made it clear to the mods I myself would never make a post about politics, and that I usually ignore their posts about Israel and such as they tend not to go into the hateful antisemitic side, and for f\*ck's sake, that was the first time I ever commented on such a topic and it was only because of antisemitism.  
In fact I previously had had an argument with a guy because I defended the Al-Andalus period and claimed Arab culture has had a huge lasting impact on Portugal and Spain to this day.  
No one seemed to have an issue when I discussed politics to argue against some Portuguese jacka\*\* who was saying the Al-Andalus period contributed nothing to us and then accused me of not being Portuguese, and that as a Jew, then he was glad I was out of the country, 'cause Jews helped the Arabs take over the peninsula.

Anyway, I get told there was no antisemitism whatsoever, that I am reding antisemitism into it, oh and of course, I am somehow accused of defending the purity of Hebrew.

They must have taken that accusation out of their a\*\*es I guess.  
I did not defend Hebrew's purity because there is no such thing.

Hebrew borrowed heavily from Arabic and many other languages (though mostly Arabic) in its reconstruction phase, the only thing I did was mention Arabic also imported words 'cause I was pissed at a comment that tried to mock Hebrew for doing the exact same thing Arabic does.

But now, not only did I do ""Zionist propaganda"" but I also defended ""the purity"" of Hebrew (somehow). So I got muted and can't reply anymore! Hooray!!!

5) POSITIVE: THE RANDOM ARABS AND TURKS GREETING ME WITH KINDNESS

A few examples:

1. I went to an Arab supermarket, with my kippah on (no, I won't hide it in an Arab supermarket, why would I? No one was ever rude to me there and they have good products!), and a man starts suddenly speaking to me out of nowhere. I assumed it was Arabic at first, then as I hear it better I understand he is speaking to me in Hebrew

""Ani lo medaber Ivrit"" I said (I can't speak Hebrew)

Turns out he is an Arab from Israel, who was here to visit some family, he's from Tel Aviv.

Seeing a Jew made him think of home and he just wanted to talk, kind of him to be honest.

2) A Tunisian co-worker at my first job once saw me take a kippah out of the locker and started speaking to me about Tunisian Jews and how many still live there and get along.

3) Some Arabs and Turks greet me extra nicely when they see me, possibly to dispell any notion they thought I may have of them being evil.

A Turk at a Döner shop even calling me brother and speaking super nicely about his life and asking about me.

6) THE TURK WHO I HOPE MARRIES MY FRIEND

Not the same friend as the Lebanese story to make it clear.  
Anyway, I have a friend who is sadly married to a German man who let's just say is pure sh\*t.  
He is aggressive, he treats her like crap, he does not respect her nor her children.

I won't go into details due to her privacy.

So recently, behind his back (as she hopes to divorce him soon) she started seeing a Turkish man from Istanbul.

Granted he is not beautiful, in fact, he is kinda ugly, but guess what? He treats her like a princess, does anything for her and is a respectful hardworking man!

Sadly my friend is kinda crazy.

I told my friend ""Leave your husband, stop drinking, stop partying, this man is the man for you! You won't always be young and beautiful, men won't always want to spend a night with you. But this guy, he'd be with you forever.""

She acts like she is not interested, but I see how jealous she is when his ex-wife is mentioned, how angry she is when he can't come to her, etc...

He is a man of character and kindness, we don't agree on everything, but we openly discuss what we think, and most often do agree.

He loves how much I often seem to know about Turkish culture and politics, and occasionally quizzes me on Jewish issues that are going on.

He knows well how I wished my friend would marry him, he treats her with more respect than anyone else ever would.  
He loves her 7 year old son, and immediately greets and plays with him whenever he comes to see her.

He has often spoken to me about private issues, as he sees me as a trustworthy and intelligent man, and I always gave him my honest thoughts.  
He also jokes a lot about my sexuality implying sometimes that I am a complete man-eating slut (I am not btw)

It might hurt to say this, but I think he is too good for my friend. Sure she is hot, but her head is empty and her life is always much trouble, he could give her the world but she'd destroy it for sure.

I hope he gets what his heart longs for, and if my friend can't give him that, I hope he finds another good woman, he deserves that.

7) POSITIVE: THE TUNISIAN NEIGHBOUR AND NOW ROOMMATE

So, when I first came to Germany 2 years ago, I came completely alone, and for a long time I lived alone.  
It was scary, depressing and well, you get it.  
The people here are not necessarily super friendly, and often it's hard to find people here to hang out with, though I managed to meet some thank god, this country is still a mostly lonely experience.

One of the neighbours who lives in the flat above mine is a Tunisian Arab man.

A smart and I should add extremely attractive man.

I admit his looks were the first thing that caught my attention, quite possibly he is one of the most beautiful men I have ever seen.

So slowly I got close to him, I'd talk to him on the staircase whenever he came back from school or the gym and just start find an excuse or topic good enough to distract him, quite a few months later we even started going out to eat and such.

Anyway, even though his looks were what caught my attention at first, now I see a man who is funny and smart, a guy who is a total a\*\*hole in a fun way.

We make jokes, including ""racist"" jokes about eachothers' cultures all the time.

He says I'm a poor Jew of the low level because I don't own a bank, I tell him I'm not rich because of my Morrocan heritage, therefore my Maghrebi blood is what keeps me down in life 'cause Maghrebis well.. you know the jokes for sure.

Obviously we insult eachother all the time in a joking way, and I view him as an honest good friend I want to grab on to.

I can see he is straight, quite clearly, so no, I don't try to get lucky with him, and I honestly don't even try, I'm just happy.

Though, I don't know if he realised I am gay or not.

He himself once even said when we discussed gay rights topics ""well I don't have any gay friend, but I wouldn't care if I had"".

But to be fair, even though I'm super open about it, and I speak openly about being gay to anyone who asks, I just never brought myself to tell him.

Heck once in class two guys asked me (cause I said some words in Arabic and Kurdish) how come I knew those words (one guy from Somalia, other from Afrin)

Me: My ex was from Syria

(interesting fact: over 90% of all guys I slept with in Germany were either Arabs or Kurds)

Response: Oh wait.. a man or a woman? (in German the possessive article immediately reveals the gender and I used a masculine possessive)

Me: A man obviously.

So yeah, I'm open, but I guess I get scared of him thinking that maybe all I see in him is his looks.  
I don't want our friendship to look dirty in his eyes.  
Deep down, I think he knows and just pretends not to know out of ""respect"" or whatnot.. but I am not sure.  
Maybe he is just that oblivious.  
Anyway, this Tunisian neighbour is super awesome with me, now he lives with me.  
He had issues with his shared flat, his roommates were dirty and savage-like, the house was always a mess.  
They are too loud and play Afghan and Iranian and even Indian music early in the morning at maximum volume and won't even allow him to study.

He also had a lot of issues with the landlord.  
He went on vacations to Tunisia and he wanted to leave his horrible room.  
I told him ""leave that room, don't pay rent during your vacations, when you come back, if you got no home, my doors are open.""

Now he is living with me, it's been a month basically, he wanted to pay me half the rent already at the beginning of the month but I refused, I told him he'd pay me at the end of the month, and that of course, I would not charge for those lousy 10 days he spent here during the last month.

Who charges their friend for just 10 days?  
Plus, my flat is small so we're not sure how long he'll stay as he is trying to find a new flat.  
If I could find a new flat for both of us I'd move immediately with him, 'cause honestly, his company is great for my mood.  
We'll see how long he stays, I've made it clear though, to me he is always welcome, and my doors will always be open.  
He is with me at my worst sometimes, and I won't forget that.

8) POSITIVE: THE TUNISIAN CLASSMATE

So, it's already been made clear in my class most students are Arabic-speakers.  
One of them is Tunisian (just like my neighbour yay!)  
Anyway, this Tunisian guy is actually German aswell, 'cause he was born here in Germany, but when he was still a baby his parents moved back to Tunisia with him.

Result: He has German nationality, but can't speak German at all.

In class he can't keep up, his German is almost as bad the Palestinian girl's.  
I take the time to help him in class 'cause I can speak some French, and I do like helping him out, he's like, super sweet and he really wants to learn.

We joke around and do a lot of activities in class to improve his German.  
Outside of class I make texts to help him prepare for our German exam soon (Saturday, the 26th, wish me luck people!)

I make the texts in German and have them translated to Arabic even, so that he can understand them.

He asked me if I would be his partner at the exam, since I always took the time to help him out (in the exam there is an oral part where you need to speak to a partner), I accepted so that I could take more time to help him.

His German is still awful, but today he even managed to hold a small dialogue. I sense some improvements.

My Jewish identity or my gayness, despite me being sure both are pretty well known, are never mentioned.  
He just jokes a lot, laughs with me, and keeps telling me to go visit Tunisia, especially Monastir, Kasserine, Tunes, Djerba, Sousse.. He always tells me how Tunisia is beautiful and I should just go.

He's sweet and very fun to be around honestly.

Well that's it folks, just felt like sharing in a none serious tone some of my own personal experiences.

I can say this much.  
I love Arab culture, as I see it as very similar to my own, after all, Portugal and Spain were heavily influenced by Al-Andalus. (I also find Turkish culture quite similar and love it, the food is a little bit more different but still so tasty!)

I love the music, the language is so beautiful, the cuisine is amazing and the Arab world is full of potential and amazing people.  
I do feel that the Arab world though is being hurt by radicalism, neo-colonialism and leaders who care only about themselves and abandon their people.  
Turkey's issues are a little extra special, but thankfully Turkey has a strong constitution that I believe will prevail overall and will protect Turkey's progress.  
But we are seeing positive change, more discussions are being held and people are slowly opening up both their hearts to new experiences, and their eyes to see what their leaders and foreign powers have been doing to their land.

I wish you all a wonderful day, and thanks for reading my ranting.",,,,,,2019-10-17 19:18:25

I'm just curious how does this all look like on-the-ground. 

Are young Tunisians passively non-religious (while still socially conservative, possibly) or are they actively non-religious and possibly counter-cultural in numerous other aspects as well? Socially, politically, etc.

dq46u5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/dq46u5/,14,For those of you who don't like the Government,"The new Government hasn't been choosed but people are already criticizing it. 

The Tunisian People made their choice of a Parliament in a free and fair elections.  

You don't like it, you think it's a disaster. I get it. Well guess what. Democracy has flaws but the amazing thing about Democracy is that Power is always restrained and temporary. One bad dictator can ruin an entire country. But even a bad leader like Trump is temporary and restrained. 

There will be other elections. Meanwhile, you should consider what are the specific policies you would like to  implement and which ones they will accept to implement. Start organizing. The German Green Party promised that if they were elected, they would ban a pesticide named Glyphosate. To weaken the electoral support for them, the German Government banned Glyphosate. In Israel, the Zehut Party promised to legalize Weed. To weaken the support for Zehut, The Government announced they will legalize weed. They lost their battles but they won the war. Politics is about Policy. It's about getting things done, not only elections.

People are not dumb.  They want hospitals, schools, food, good jobs. If you think you should have won, my advice is seriously reflect on what went wrong. Do you know your voters ? What was your message ? Who were your candidates ? How did you select them ? How did you campaign ? Did you organize public meetings ? How did others mobilize their base ? Why didn't your voters mobilize on election day ? 

If you do a better job than the current parties at crafting a vision, then you too can win.",,,,,,2019-11-01 13:24:35

dttza3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/dttza3/,1,Why do Tunisians like songs from other Arab countries and cherish them as if they were their own?,"I mean you hear Abdelwaheb, Om Kaltoum, Fairouz (to name a few) almost every day. Older folks like them as if they were “our traditional” songs to listen to when you re enjoying yourself. They even know the lyrics!

Meanwhile, songs of Semleli or Nema or Jurno (again to name a few) are played on occasions you can count on the fingers of your hand... Forget about younger people knowing these songs and who sang them...

Why is there this controversy?

Edit 1: People do not seem to see what I mean. My point is that it is extremely odd to know more about other arab countries’ older national singers/heritage and not our own. Especially the younger generation is so fudged up in this matter.

It seems people do not notice this discrepancy, which is even scarier!!

Edit 2/ last: nobody seems to understand my point so far. Quite disappointed, but hey that s life!",,,,,,2019-11-09 09:44:28

He calmly took the ""egg carton"" and said, ""There's no need for eggs. I can live without eating eggs."" This work was also done by all citizens without campaigns or strikes, but it was a culture of people! A people did not accept that the companies will take advantage .. In your opinion, how were the results? !!!
Less than a week later, the company workers came to take the eggs to the shops, but the owners refused to take down any new egg cartons, because the old egg cartons was not bought by anyone!
The companies insisted on the resistance of the people, saying that these protests will end in a few days, and people will return to buy eggs as usual. But the people were back, the egg whip, and the companies began to lose, twice, the first in the stacked eggs, and the second in feeding the chicken that does not stop eating and produce eggs, accumulated losses and doubled!
The owners of poultry companies met and decided to return the price of eggs to its previous price, although the boycott continued, and companies almost declare bankruptcy, they were only to meet again and decided the following:
- To provide an official apology to the Argentine people in all media.
- Reduce the price of eggs to a quarter of its previous value.
This is a true story, not a fiction
As a people, we can lower or raise the price of any commodity
With our own will only without campaigns or strikes
We need only a little will, culture and determination.",,,,,,2019-11-12 18:04:59

Est-ce que vous connaissez des rappeurs/rappeuses Tunisien(ne)s ou plus largement arabes?

Je suis plutot rap a l'ancienne et j'ai vraiment du mal avec la trap et les instrus electro bourrines a la sauce dubstep. Je prefere les intrus funks des 90s ou meme les samples de musique classique qu'on trouve pas mal dans le rap francais. Niveau flow, j'adore les trucs un peu techniques, les flows rapides pleins d'alliterations. C'est ce que je recherche avant tout avec l'arabe: des ""9a"", des ""7a"", et des ""5a"" qui fusent!

Beaucoup de bla bla, mais pour citer quelques trucs que j'aime:

- rap francais: NTM, doc gyneco, IAM, disiz (les anciens), fonky family, les vieux albums de snipers (encore que la prod est pas ouf), et plus recemment Davodka et surtout je suis un grand fan de Hugo TSR et des ceux qui gravitent autour du TSR crew.

That without talking about the unions that are way too strong in the public sector although they are necessary for the private, but goddamn they abuse their powers like the last case of corruption in the intercities bus company.
Also the fact that tunisair is basically ruined because of unions and corruption and they kept for a long time blocking the opensky agreement making tickets more expensive for everyone and hindering the tourism sector.

It was surrounded by the usual fanfare and cigars and champagne dreams? Did anything happen? Here is a summary and 2 useful links. I have to admit it had some good strategic pointers but sadly the execution was nil,"**A democratic Tunisia on the path of inclusive and sustainable development**

After nearly four years of consultations and efforts, supported by the international community, the political transition is well underway: the first free and fair elections took place at the end of 2014, leading to the establishment of democratic and legitimate institutions on a national level.

As soon as the Government came into power in early 2015, an inclusive dialogue was initiated with different stakeholders, both at national and regional levels, in an aim to define a model of economic and social development that is inclusive and sustainable: the 2016-2020 Development Plan, put forward by the Tunisian Government, is the distillation of this process.

*This Plan focuses on five lines of actions:*

1. Good governance, administrative reform and fight against corruption;
2. Transition from a low-cost economy to an economic hub;
3. Human development and social inclusion;
4. Realizing the ambitions of the regions;
5. The green economy, a pillar of sustainable development.

In parallel, the Tunisian Government is committed to conducting multiple structural reforms, in all areas, to achieve greater efficiency and to foster private investment.

To promote this new paradigm, the Tunisian Government invites the international community, counting on the representation of all its members at the highest levels, to a conference on the 29th and 30th of November 2016 in Tunis. First, this conference will begin with a pledging conference. Then, secondly, the conference will put light on the axes and on the structural projects listed in the Development Plan, as well as on the investment opportunities offered to private operators.

**The conference aims to achieve the following objectives:**

1. Promote the 2016-2020 Development Plan, its objectives and policy choices, as well as the major balances and financing needs;
2. Present the agenda of reforms of the Tunisian Government, aiming at:a. Bringing the State apparatus to a higher level of efficiency ;b. Improving Tunisia's attractiveness for private operators, whether local or foreign, by enhancing the legal framework for investment.
3. Raise the funds to finance the development of the major infrastructure projects, notably through public-private partnership schemes;
4. Assist private investors to identify, very specifically, sectors and positions in value chains worthy of interest in every region of the country. 

**Conference program: November 29th &amp; 30th, 2016**

**PLEDGING CONFERENCE: ON THE MORNING OF THE 29TH OF NOVEMBER**On the first half of the first day, the pledging conference will be opened and hosted by the President of the Tunisian Republic:a. Tunisian officials will present the Development Plan, the agenda of reforms and the fiscal balances;b. Country representatives and heads of international institutions will announce their support, by the way of a contribution to the budget and/or to the financing of the projects listed in the Development Plan;c. This first half day will be concluded by a joint statement, and then the President will host a lunch at the Presidential Palace.

**THE CONFERENCE GOING FORWARD: THE WORKSHOPS***1. Afternoon of the 29th of November: curbing regional disparities, the necessary efforts and opportunities*a. Providing infrastructure to improve links with the most isolated areas, and enhancing public servicesb. Capacity buildingc. Comparative advantages, sectors, and industries presenting an opportunity for investors

*2. Gala Dinner (Host: Head of Government)3. Morning of the 30th of November: a green economy for a sustainable development*a. Renewable energy: solar and windb. Agriculture and water managementc. Collecting and recycling waste

*4. Afternoon of the 30th of November: Tunisia, a regional economic hub for the export of high value added goods and services*a. Historic sectors : textile, tourism and healthb. Transformative industries: automotive and aerospacec. Innovative sectors: software development

It seems that my family goes out of their way to prevent me from taking cold showers during the winter claiming that it could make me sick and give me joint and bone issues, aka ""yothrbek hwe"". 

Another thing they ask me to watch out for is ""courant d'air"" or an air draft, apparently you shouldn't have your front and back door or window open simultaneously while you're inside because that causes muscle stiffness and the flu/cold. 

I never understood why or how and it still doesn't make sense to me. This ideology? seems to be embedded in our people, I was arguing with a number of different people and they all shared the same opinion, that it's bad.

Can you peeps please debunk or back this claim up? I tried looking online for answers, but I couldn't really find any, which leaves me to believe that it's probably not true.",,,,,,2019-11-26 18:31:22

I need your help

Basic figures:

Girl, escaped from Libya,  crossed the border by plane, legally.

Escaped becasue of life threating circumstances.

She went for  a meeting in to that organization:  

[https://tunisia.iom.int/si%C3%A8ge-oim-tunisie](https://tunisia.iom.int/si%C3%A8ge-oim-tunisie)

&amp;#x200B;

Since she had  gone   to that facility the contact  has been lost. Phone is not available. 

I called  that facility  and the only information that I got is that she was there, she is safe  and they detained  her under some national organization .

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are:

\- as she went legally  in to Tunisia what might be the cause of detention?

\- what the procedures are? she will be placed in to some refugee camp  if she admitted that she have run away from her country?

Please if someone is familiar with those procedures let me know.",,,,,,2019-12-13 14:51:42

eailcx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/eailcx/,19,When eyes tell stories deeper than words..[True Story],"(Tunis,''Barchalouna'' ) ,yesterday,around 18:40 pm.

It was very cold. I was by the end of the sidewalk waiting for the train to arrive.  

She was just standing there alone in the middle of the crowd.

by the time the train arrived, i found myself standing close to her waiting for the doors to open.

&amp;#x200B;

i was waiting for all the people to get inside since they were rushing in like a  herd of sheep.After a while, I thought i was the last one outside, but she was standing behind me,

it's like she wanted to be the last one to get on the train.

i stepped back and indicated to her, using a hand sign,that she can enter before me.She stared at me for a second then got into the train.

as i was looking for a place to sit,i noticed that the seat next to her was empty, but i sat on the other side of the wagon but close enough for me to see her,because i didn't want to seem creepy.

I was starring at her reflection on the window glass.

i noticed that she didn't keep her eyes off me too.So i decided to look straight at her,but She just kept looking at me without making any facial expressions,i couldn't really tell if she liked me

or the complete opposite.

She had a kind of understated beauty, Her face was youthful but it wasn't simple to understand, it was not fresh, but it was mild.She was wearing this small glowing septum piercing.

Against her pale yet flawless skin,She had a deep brown hair with an effortlessly made ponytail.

As i was staring at her,i could feel the sadness lurking within her beautiful yet ambiguous dark hazel eyes,

they were giving a glare that was freezing my bones.

I wanted to smile at her everytime we made eye contact but i just couldn't, her stare just brought sadness to my soul, i felt like i had a taste of what she was feeling, it's like she was Traumatized or afraid of something

even though she was keeping a straight face.

thirty minutes into the trip.she left her seat and stood next to the door,and guess what? she was still staring at me.it's like she was giving me a sign, So i did the same, and i headed her way.

I wanted to talk to her, ask her..anything. But there were other people standing next to us, i was hesitating to say something.She kept her head down as she was looking towards me.She's even prettier upclose.

The train stopped, Doors opened,it's ''Rades'' the station where most of passengers leave ,she made that last eye contact with me and then got off the train,I followed her with my eyes as she threaded her way in and out of the crowd.

I didn'know what to do, i wanted to talk to her but i felt like it was too late. but just before the train closed its doors,i jumped out of the train.It's not where i live,what am i doing?

This is not like me. I'm always good at talking to girls and i have no problem  initiating the conversation with them, but this felt so different.

But i wasn't  thinking at the moment all what i wanted was to reach the girl  but the place was very crowded,i looked everywhere but all i saw was other faces.I was too late, she's gone.I closed my eyes and sighed in desperation.

Next thing i knew, the station was empty, no one was around, it was freezing and i only had a hoodie on.

The cold moves in only to meet the warmth of my blood,i sat there, alone in the dark, regretting my hesitation, I had still not recovered from her intense stare.

It's funny,you say, not a single word was spoken..Yet all these feelings unleashed..",,,,,,2019-12-14 11:17:48

ecth60,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/ecth60/,16,"Application to evaluate the government, the president and parliamentary members work","Hello Tunisian Redditors,

So, I have an idea that I have been working on it slowly for a while. And I need your advice/thinking about it.

I want to solve two major issues:

1. Lack of communication between the politicians and the people. Politicians don't really listen to people and try to understand what they really want.
2. Organization of all demands that the people needs.

So it came the idea that I create an applications that allow people to evaluate every politician, people can like/dislike a politician and add a comment, and then see what ***score*** that politician have in ***real-time***.

There'll be a section that allow people to add a demand (مطالب شعبية) and allow people too to vote other demands, demands will be sorted based on their score (how many positive votes).

Any person has the choice to use the app anonymously or reveal whatever information he wants, there will be a technique that prevent any person to use his device for multiple persons (false data).

In summary, it will be 4 section:

1. President, to evaluate and comment the president work
2. Parliamentary members, to evaluate and comment the work of each member.
3. Government, to evaluate and comment the work of each minister
4. Demands, to let people add/vote demands..

I think it will be a good start since digital services are absent in Tunisia. The app will be non-profitable (no ads, no money needs to be paid).

So, what do you think and suggest? :)",,,,,,2019-12-19 13:53:28

I love this country and nobody can change my mind. 

- Few days ago, i was walking home at night from work, a collective Taxi just stopped by and a girl was crying accusing a man of touching her. So unlucky for that men she was living in my neighbourhood and a bunch of young men were near her, and hell's gate just opened, he got his ass whooped and dragged to the police station. Goddamt i felt so fcking good to see that shit in front of me. 




- This happened to me tonight, i was so sick i had to take a shot in the E.R nearby where i live. I felt dizzy i couldn't yell or speak out loud, i grabbed a little boy arm who was sitting next to me and gave him a card with the name of the shot i took and told him im going to collapse. Indeed i collapsed, the boy started the quest and i saw him talking to the nurse before i shutdown. 
While on the emerald dream i kept hearing the voices of ppl trying to help me, water, juice, sugar, and everything. Few minutes later the engine started again, i thanked everyone personally and wished them a very good night.


Idk why i wanted to share this.

Peace.

In the current system, questions that bring up a good discussion are given the same weight as those who ask about where to buy a bicycle in Tunis and answered within an hour.

Exemples of questions that have their own threads but could totally fit here instead :

https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/efwwj8/good_hiking_trails_fi_tounes/

https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/ef8xf9/question_about_moving_to_germany_with_french_bac/

https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/ef3rbp/rapid_poste/

https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/efxan9/cheap_cafes_in_more_expensive_places/



So we're testing this new thread to create a space where you can ask those quick questions. **If you're reading this far, we encourage you to check this thread once in a while to check for new questions that you could help with (the thread will be sorted by new).** For now we will not be changing any rules and we'll see how this thread works out!",,,,,,2019-12-26 16:48:24

I feel like the least we can do ( being an example of democracy and human rights in the region ) is support them diplomatically . 
I'm by no means a fan of erdogan but I'm honestly fine with them using our soil for logistics should they decide to deploy troops ( we already have Americans here but hey no one cares because it wasn't published on mosaique right ? ) .",,,,,,2019-12-27 14:36:00

egrrs8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/egrrs8/,9,Why are we like this?,"One cannot help but wonder on what led us to be the country we are? ( Anti freedom. anti liberty. uncivil. No social contract. Superstitious. Ignorant.) What are the axioms that led us to an empty voided intellectual life and a shallow reactionary ill guided public discussion?
The political and intellectual landscape is formed mostly of Marxists and Romanticised sophists and anti progress cuckoos. There is never ever a deep intellectual debate about the framing of our systems.
It is baffling and sad when you look at the discussion that are going on elsewhere about globalism and humanism and the markets and the evolution of ideas and their retracing. While our TVs and internet discussions are only about trivialities of political schemes and surface level policies.
I keep hearing that the political class is undergoing an ideological war? How? Where are the ideological arguments? What are the ideologies that exists in Tunisia apart from Marxism and post stalinist socialism?

So we’re having this school project about researching on some of the North African Countries and one of the categories that was needed for the research was the fondly name of the country. The fondly name is more of a nickname of the country (e.g. Rwanda: Land a thousand hills, Egypt: The gift of the Nile). But when we searched for the fondly name of Tunisia, we couldn’t seemingly find anything on google. So I was wondering if any of you guys have any idea of what the fondly name of the country may be.  thankss!
