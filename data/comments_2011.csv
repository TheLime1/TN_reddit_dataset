All social claims are being discussed, the constitutional changes are the next big step. For now, the whole system is changing , the legal modifications should take longer.",2011-02-11 07:12:32

The chaos that spread around was all because of mercenaries the president has left to ""burn down"" everything he ""built"". Things for now aren't completely  well as some of those bandits are still making problems, it's not that safe to walk around at a late hour anymore. Hopefully, the order will be progressively restored and all people's demands will be fullfilled.",2011-02-10 19:14:06

c2zh9ke,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/map95/,3,"Hey, just want to put my two cents in. I'm not a native Tunisian, but I've been in the country during the elections/campaigns, and I've spoken to a lot of Tunisians about Ennadha and about the recent elections. For the most part, it really seems like the rest of the world sees moderate Islam and freaks out, thinking it's ""radical"". Albeit, all I have is an on-the-street perspective, but from down here, Ennadha is far from radical. Not to say that there isn't political corruption and more conservative religious aspects to some of their platform, but the majority of Tunisians that I talk to say that Ennadha is moderate and the rest of the world is skewing things. 

Personally, my only interactions with any part of Ennadha is the fact that they bribed some of my friends' maids to vote for them, which doesn't put them in a good light to me, but you asked for *Tunisian* perspectives, so that's what they tell me! :) [I have a lot of Tunisian friends here who would be more than willing to talk to you! Let me know what you need!] ",2011-11-13 19:45:06

c2zpjky,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/map95/,2,"Well, apart from the fact that unemployment and poverty are a problem and Ennadha was offering money for votes....I think that, as far as my Tunisian friends have told me, Ennadha really does represent (for them) what they want. It satisfies the more traditional, conservative people because it promotes moderate Islam, while also having a forward-thinking approach towards bringing Tunisia to modernity. Tunisians are on the whole extremely moderate, with a lot of secularism left over from Ben Ali, so if Ennadha was truly as extreme as people say, I doubt they would've been as popular.

And I completely agree with your headlines comment. Unfortunately, its undermining a country's attempts to become a stable, moderate nation...",2011-11-14 18:45:40

c1grnuk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/fl9hc/,1,"it is probably hard to explain this really well since you don't live here, but we have been counting on the government's support or coverage of the fact, we aren't talking about 1, or 2 tunisians here, they are 20 persons on that tanker and they are crying for help. Other nations would have made it a national cause and the media would have been highlighting the event. Instead, the victims have been totally ignored. The families have no garantees that there is effective pressure on the shipowner to get the crew back as soon as possible before any dramatic thing happens. The french oil tanker owned by Total has been retreived back in just 23 days because the government was involved and they helped them pay the ransom very fast. 

Businessmen in Tunisia have always been  protected by the corrupted regime, the marines didn't even have a syndicate to protect their rights. After many protests we have been finally able to have a face-to-face confrontation with Farid Abbas, the actual shipowner. This wouldn't have been the case if the previous regime was still standing.",2011-02-14 19:47:49

I know the questions are very general, but I wasn't sure I'd get any response at all so I didn't wanna scare people away by being to ... boring, or something. Anyway i'll be a bit more specific:

From what I have understood, Tunisia has never had any real free elections, ever. How does that influence the democratic process? Do people trust in democrazy? Is there any risk of a new dictatorship rising into power?

&gt;...will get worse because the transitionnal goverment don't have the right to make radical desicion to change current affair.

Which radical decisions should be taken? 

How would you explain the fact that Ennahda got almost 40 % of the votes? 

How come Tunisian protesters didn't have the same trouble with the police and military as in say Libya or Syria? 

If you excuse me for asking, how old are you? And where in Tunisia are you from? I'm asking because I've been led to believe that there are some pretty big differences between the north and south, correct me if I'm wrong.

That's all i can come up with for now. Anyways, thanks again! ",2011-11-13 18:38:22
c2zhd2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/map95/,1,"I blame the media and the consumers. Headlines such as ""Moderate and conservative party wins in a landslide in Tunisia"" probably doesn't sell that many papers..

c33f7z7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/mr5ik/,1,"My personal recommendation would be a louage from Tunis. It's a long trip but always nice and cheap since it's subsidized and set by the government. Or take a train down to Gabes (Can always stop in Sfax or El Jem, runs about 25 dinar or 20 for bus) and louage hop from there, maybe hit Matmata etc if you haven't seen areas around there. Or vice versa but maybe make a round trip? Lots to see in that entire area.
