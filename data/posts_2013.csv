Recently discovered this subreddit and I have a question:

Do Tunisians have any means of owning legit Steam accounts and buy subscriptions with Paypal/Credit card? I have yet to see a fellow Tunisian own a non-stolen digital collection of games.

PS. I know there's more important stuff we should discuss in this subreddit, but I see it more like a Tunisian community. We should totally make a Steam community group :)

19ch7u,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/19ch7u/political_realities_and_the_tunisian/,1,Political Realities and the Tunisian Constitutional Drafting Process," Monday in Geneva, the Tunisian National Constitution Assembly’s Speaker Mustapha Ben Jaafar stated that finalizing a draft constitution by April would be “a real challenge.” Such a comment by the Speaker illustrates the point discussed previously on this blog that it is extremely difficult to set arbitrary dates on the completion of such an important process. Tunisia took a novel if difficult approach to the creation of a time frame in sharp contrast to the approaches of Libya and Egypt. Tunisia has set no legal time frame on the completion of the constitution, but the country’s current leadership has promised the populace that the document would be completed first by October of 2012, then by February of 2013 and most recently by April of 2013. It appears that keeping this promise will once again prove immensely difficult.
            
It is important to understand that this does not meant the process is devoid of progress. The announcement came only a day after the general debate on legislative and executive powers was ended, clearing a major hurdle in the process.

Constitutional drafting is vitally important for the future of a free country. Progress takes time. Tunisia is showing solid progress; however, the political realities that have forced leadership to place arbitrary dates on the completion of the constitution could hasten the process and endanger the progress made.

Hello Everyone!

ASSLAMA! (it means **Hello** in Tunisian not Ass Lama :D )

Many of this small subreddit users have already tried to organize the first Tunisian Reddit Meetup but haven't been successful in doing so. However I really hope that this message gets to as many people as possible to actually make it happen this time.

Yes Reddit! you heard me! I am inviting my fellow redditors for a meeting in any place in Tunis (I was thinking first about Sidi Bou Said): Beverage will be of course for free (Non Alcoholic Beverages, I can't buy alcoholic drinks for personal/religious reasons sorry!) and any other treats as long as they won't be extremely expensive (not superiour to 4-5 dinars!).

If you have any questions in regards to myself or the place and time we will be meeting at, don't hesitate to send me a pm!

If you have any reddit themed material bring it and show it off! I am getting mine as well!

My preferences for the Meet Up Day is June 16th . Let's see first how many of you would be able to make it on these days or what would their preference be!",,,,,,2013-05-05 11:24:53

I've found it in numerous places, but I'm having trouble tracing the original source. Moreover, there seems to be some dialogue going on in the photograph between Ben Ali and Bouazizi, and what I'm also hoping to find in the original source is what is being said here.

tl;dr Can someone tell me the original source/article of the photograph?

I'm looking to connect with hackerspaces and people interested in them!

On the 28th I'll be running a workshop on Hackerspaces/Makerspaces as part of Google Entrepreneurship Week in Tunis. It would be awesome to have a couple people familiar with the Tunisia hackerspace scene help out!

I'm talking with a couple wonderful individuals on #hackerspaces.tn on IRC, any other recommendations?

Background: I help run All Hands Active, a hackerspace in Ann Arbor, MI USA. I am traveling with a group that is looking to communicate, share, and learn about entrepreneurship.
