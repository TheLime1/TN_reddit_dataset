fl9hc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/fl9hc/one_month_after_the_fall_of_ben_alis_regime_in/,2,"One month after the fall of Ben Ali's regime in Tunisia, did things really change? 20 tunisians are still being held in Somalia yet the government hasn't done anything to get them back.","With the events that took place in Tunisia recently, the hijacking of the tunisian tanker Hannibal II and the kidnapping of its crew composed of 31 persons has been unfortunately overlooked by our media.  20 tunisians are held in Somalia now with 10 others who have various nationalities. 95 days have passed now since the day the tunisian tanker Hannibal II was hijacked.

The families are receiving heartbreaking SOS calls from the victimes and were obliged to be silent and kept uninformed about the negociations that were presumably taking place. When the ousted president's regime was still functionnal, we had no right to demand for any clarifications, now we were able to protest and spread the word, however it appears to be that the government is unable to solve the matter and more likely to be focusing on the political disorder phase we are going through...not that they would have the money to pay the ransom anyways. 

My cousin is the captain on board and he made a clear statement when he called, the crew can't take it any longer, they run out of meds, food, they are under lot of psychological pressure, some of them are having thoughts about commiting suicide, it's a matter of life or death. The families of the kidnapped crew are planing for more protests  in order to urge the authorities to take immediate actions and save them. There is a significant distorsion between the statements that were originally heard from the victims and what the owner of the tanker has been telling us. Suspicions rose when the promises of being informed regularly with proven elements that negociations are taking place weren't kept and the business man who should be in charge for it is suspected of simply speculating till the ransom goes down.

 The reason why I'm posting this to reddit is first and foremost to get perhaps some attention concerning this subject, as I would be interested in hearing any thoughts, actual facts, important records, ideas or maybe some advice concerning the piracy phenomenon in that area. And second, to ask if we should really turn our shoulders in disbelief of the victims' appeal, because that's what we were told to do.

I live in the US can someone please help me help her.,"I'm trying to find help for my friend in Tunisia.  They live near Sousse.  She has been severely depressed and has talked of harming herself.  What resources are there that she can go to to get help?  She is too proud to try to get help herself but as a friend I cannot let this stand.  I'm afraid she will eventually do something stupid.  Please help.  I've found a hospital near her but I do not speak French and on the English portion of the site there is no ""Contact"" portion so they may not understand my google translated email to them.

Does anyone know who they are?  Are they being provided for?  Does he have children who need clothing, schooling, etc?

Can we identify and possibly help this family?  They lost their father when he helped change the world; it'd be tragic if his sacrifice merely compounded their problems.",,,,,,2011-02-24 19:06:36

I went with him to the ATM, but he couldn't withdraw money because HIS CREDIT CARD HAS EXPIRED.

We went to the post bureau and asked if we could renew it, they said that in order to withdraw we had to send the money AS FUCKING WIRE TRANSFER. So, we go back home, and get lost for about an hour before reaching our destination. 

We perform the required application, and guess what? 5 DT taxes and 48 hours to process!

Fuck this, fuck everything about this. I've lost my saturday morning just for this?????!!!??
