I'm really excited to go, I think it would be an interesting experience to go to Tunisia with someone who's Tunisian (granted he's Tunisian-European and mostly grew up in Europe, but he goes to Tunisia every year so he at least knows a little about what's up). I'm definitely all for learning about another culture, and this seems like a great opportunity to do so.

But I'm an American woman who grew up with a somewhat racist and Islamophobic mom. I know nothing about Tunisia (I've since done some Wikipedia-ing), or Africa, or.. Well... Anything.

What I'm saying is that there's a part of me that's afraid to go. My mom and TV have lead me to believe that by going to Africa I'm going to come back with some terrible freaky disease, or that because I'm a woman I'm going to get kidnapped or raped or something (because Muslims, amirite? /s).

He just invited me last night and said he'd call me today with more details, so I don't know what area I'd be in exactly but I can update that information.

Would you recommend I go to Tunisia? What should I expect when I get there? And just any other advice you could give me about making the most of this experience and getting past some of the irrational fears I have about traveling in Africa/Tunisia.

Juan Cole is Richard P. Mitchell Collegiate Professor of History at the University of Michigan. He is author of *Engaging the Muslim World* and *Napoleon's Egypt*. He has been a regular guest on PBS's *News Hour* and has also appeared on *ABC Nightly News*, *Nightline*, the *TODAY* show, *Charlie Rose*, *Anderson Cooper 360*, *Rachel Maddow*, the *Colbert Report*, *Democracy Now!*, *Aljazeera America* and many others.

&gt; [*The New Arabs: How the Millennial Generation is Changing the Middle East*](http://www.amazon.com/New-Arabs-Millennial-Generation-Changing-ebook/dp/B00GEECHL6/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;sr=8-1&amp;qid=1401140292)
&gt; 
&gt;The renowned blogger and Middle East expert Juan Cole illuminates the role of today's Arab youth — who they are, what they want, and how they will affect world politics.
&gt;
&gt;Beginning in January 2011, the revolutionary wave of demonstrations and protests, riots, and civil wars that comprised what many call ""the Arab Spring"" shook the world. These upheavals were spearheaded by youth movements, and yet the crucial role they played is relatively unknown. Middle East expert Juan Cole is here to share their stories.
&gt;
&gt;For three decades, Cole has sought to put the relationship of the West and the Muslim world in historical context. In *The New Arabs* he outlines the history that led to the dramatic changes in the region, and explores how a new generation of men and women are using innovative notions of personal rights to challenge the authoritarianism, corruption, and stagnation that had afflicted their societies.
&gt;
&gt;Not all big cohorts of teenagers and twenty-somethings necessarily produce movements centered on their identity as youth, with a generational set of organizations, symbols, and demands rooted at least partially in the distinctive problems besetting people of their age. The Arab Millennials did. And, in a provocative and optimistic argument about the future of the Arab world, *The New Arabs* shows just how they did it.",,,,,,2014-07-06 18:13:06

It is secure (cryptocurrency)
It transcends national borders meaning you can pay anywhere in the world!

* First day, wandering around Tunis, we took shelter from a rain shower under a shop's awning.  Someone came out and started chatting; when we mentioned we were headed to Kairouan he phoned up a friend of his who lives there and arranged to have him show us aruond.

* Upon arriving, friend in question picked us up from the louage station, recommended a hotel, where he arranged a discount for us with the manager and bought us a meal of couscous and lamb at a restaurant, among other things.

* In Mahdia, when we asked about where to find a shop to buy water nearby, we were given a bottle and then invited into the family's home to look around and see the decorative tiling.

* On a louage from Tozeur to Kebili, a woman struck up a conversation with us, invited us to her home (we were unable to accept, unfortunately, being short on time) and spontaneously gave my wife a watch as a souvenir

I looked it up and it looks [awesome!](http://www.cst.rnu.tn/en/).  They have a big planetarium to see a ""show"" and you can go on a virtual tour of the museum on the site itself.  It all looks really fascinating.  Unfortunately it's closed until September 17th but, I was hoping that would be enough time to get some people to go.

Perhaps we can make plans for September 20th to go here and have a good look around.  It appears to have fossils (not sure if real but, probably are) and the planetarium itself.  Afterwards we can maybe hit up some food at the nearby restaurants's that are nearby.  Warning, my Arabic/Tunisian/French is non-existent but I assume most here (if not all) speak English at least pretty well.  So there shouldn't be too much of a language barrier and if so, /u/Enti_San will be there so she can translate a bit.

She's vegan, against government anything pretty much, and just got her Oregon medical marijuana card (despite it going legal here shortly) just to ""stick it"" to the man and have a few weeks more of marijuana use legally before everyone else.  

She met this guy (a native Tunisian) in Paris while she was on vacation there for a couple of weeks.  He's been described to me by family as a ""beach bum"" without a job.  When she returned, they corresponded for about a month and now are getting married.  I've read a little bit about Tunisia (and I'm thinking she has not).  She does not speak Arabic or French (just English)-- how screwed is she?  She's decided her money making scheme/job is going to be crystal healing and is not religious at all (in fact, I would go so far as to say she's frankly contemptuous of religions themselves).  She seems to think she won't have to end her marijuana use (not sure if this is because she thinks she can get away with it now having an Oregon Medical Marijuana card or that it just generally won't be an issue)

Don't get me wrong, I don't think Tunisia is a terrible place, I just think she is going into this without the right research and attitude which may not end up serving her very well.

/r/Tunisia what kind of things should I try to bring up to make her realize what she's getting in to while we're at Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow?

I was wondering if any of you is aware about [this news (or rumor) which consist of allowing Tunisian mobile developer to have an international credit card](http://www.digitives4ward.com/tunisie-carte-de-credit-internationale/),
At first this might sound like a good news but when you think about it is nothing more than another **WTF!!** joke from the *rulers* of this country. As a developer, gamer and a Tunisian citizen, i believe that i have the right to use my money anywhere and everywhere as long as am not using it to buy illegal stuff. 

I really hope there is a lawyer or anyone who has some law knowledge here who can finally answer this question, Why we can use our money **only** inside the country ?? am not talking about paypal or an international Master/Visa card, am talking about money transfer, 3 days ago i went to my bank hoping that i can make a bank transition to someone who work with me and i was really surprised when my banker said ""unfortunately you can't do that"". Bank services and financial low is so shitty here, i can't even access my bank information online -__- but that is not a big deal, the real problem is why the government is trying ""her"" best to limit us and what can we do to change this ??  

Thank you

You would need a car in case if we need to go somewhere for an errand and I need to go with.  Also being able to translate for me with a doctor or lab technician or if I need to speak to someone else.  I only speak English just as a heads up.

We can discuss more details if you're interested.  Can interview on skype or in person.  My general location is Lac 2.  A good knowledge of where stuff is in Tunisia helps too like pharmacies, florists, things like that.  If interested, please send me a PM.  Thank you.

*edit*

I forgot to add this would be for about 4-6 hours a week typically.  Anywhere from 2-3 hours twice a week.  This may vary but would give a couple days notice to see when you're free whenever possible.  May setup a set schedule as well.",,,,,,2014-12-22 04:54:40
