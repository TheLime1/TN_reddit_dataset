f3wdhpz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/dihlwl/,24,"One of the most important, if not the most, is the reaction of the military to the revolution. It is a well known fact that the key role that the military played in our revolution is what made it succeed. The military, breaking the law, refused to answer to the president and also refused to assume leadership on the demand of foreign entities, cough U FUCKING SA cough, which I humbly assume is exactly what happened in Egypt. By my own analysis, this is due to Ben Ali not keeping good ties with the military and with our law that bans Soldiers from voting, noting that their loyalty first and foremost lies with the country and its people, not with any party or any idealogy. And whether you choose to believe my narrative or not, the military did uphold that and demanded nothing and even protected the people against the politically controlled police of Ben Ali. 
So the bottom line is, the military was of the same oppressed and betrayed class that went to the streets and protested against Ben Ali. For a literal example of the other extreme look at Sudan. 

Also can we also mention the difference in populations? We're far less than Egyptians and that makes it easier to organize our efforts. And like it or not, Tunisians especially aren't as divided as other Arab countries like Syria, Yemen and so on (I don't know about Egypt specifically). 
I'll write a more concise analysis and add sources later since I'm on mobile rn.

etp7z6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/ccsf9v/,23,"Rent a nice Duplex or apartment in an upper-class neighbourhood in Tunis: 1300 to 2000 DT. For 2000 DT you'd most definetely have one of the fanciest places in Tunis (La Marsa, Mutuelle-ville, Menzah 1/5/6, calm places with a lot of retirees/families). You can look up rental on sites like Tayara and Tunisie-annonce.

Most medical expenses are covered by the CNAM. But I would not advise relying on them for anything other than medication or physical therapy. Lasik is very cheap and has a glowing reputation in Tunisia btw.

Food is cheap. It can be 500DT a month if you parents cook traditional and want to eat fancy... Or up to 800DT for fancier foods.

Gas is about 5DT for 3 Liters. Expect around 60 to 80DT a month. Public Transportation is not senior citizen friendly at all.

A nice city car would be around 27000DT. But you can bring a tax-free car for your parents from Canada under the FCR policy. Ask your parents or visit the Tunisian custom's site for info. This is a very important tip... Trust me.

I'd say retirees can live like effective 1 percenters in Tunisia for 1500 CAD a month. 1000 CAD would be largely enough if your parents are moving back to their place in Tunisia. Broadband is about 12-20 CAD per month. Electric around 400 to 500 per trimester. Water 50 to 100 per trimester.

(But not as bad as it is now)

Yet that was far from satisfying Bourguiba who considered the aggression as a violation to the tacit agreement according to which Tunisia would not suffer from offering hospitality to the PLO which was forced to leave Lebanon 

Aware that this assault was an attack against the country and an aggression against his dignity as a leader, he decided to bring the case before the UN Security Council. He even threatened the US ambassador in Tunisia to reconsider Tunisian friendship relations with the US if they would veto any UN resolution against Israel.

This aggression happened about 2 weeks before the USSR annual celebrations of the bolchevik revolution, so while he was at the limit of respect with the US ambassador, Bourguiba whose anticommunism was so well known. suddenly warmly received the USSR ambassador and decided to let him make a commemorative speech on their revolution that was live broadcasted throughout the country on the unique national TV channel.

The US got the message. But their misadventure in Tunisia wasn’t over. A few days later the Secretary of State George Shultz made the trip to Tunis, only to know better Bourguiba’s bad anger who threatened him with his cane assuring that he would not hesitate to cross the line and join the eastern block if the US would defend the case that the Israeli operation took place in an extraterritorial space (which do not belong to Tunisia).

Religion in Tunisia was a tradition/culture, I’m Muslim because my parents are Muslim because there parents was Muslim because I live in a Muslim family etc 
This way to think is still dominant today

But we start to see a form of individual spirituality, people are more educated and choose their own way 

So I don’t think it’s more secular, but maybe more selfish and intellectual in term of spirituality.

and between us? the UN doesn't give a shit about ""third tier"" countries as long as the ""core"" countries are fine.

heck, the US and UK admitted that they faked the proof of existence of weapon of mass destruction in Irak, they said ""sorry, we invaded Irak for the oil and gold, our bad, there were no WMD, we faked everything"" and that's it, everyone laughed and got on with his life, no International Criminal Court, no crimes against humanity, no repercussions.

you have to understand and above all to make peace with the idea that right now and t be franc from the beginning of time, strong countries and groups always get away with anything they do, be it good or evil, because no other strong country or group want to face them or lose time to face them with the truth.

you can get away with whatever you do if you are backed with the right group.

every country is self-centered and cares only about herself.

every politician wants only one thing and one thing only: being reelected and that makes him seek actions that resonate with his electorate in electoral years that's why, every electoral year you have a war, a big operation, a big deal negotiation, a big threat appearing; something that makes the politician look string and caring about his people.

long story short : make a global war, far away from your country home, sell weapons to the allies, make the defeated country pay for it, bring your private sector to rebuild the defeated country and while you are there, ""liberate"" some oil field and some airport and transport the oil to your home country to ""save"" it from terrorists because you are a ""good guy with a gun""",2019-06-16 20:14:47

He's been accused of money laundering and Embezzlement since around 2016 ( mainly by I watch ) which he tried to discredit by launching a propaganda campaign on his private channel ( He explicitly said in leaked audios that he wanted fake accusations on that ONG to be broadcasted asap ) . Eventually he's indicted of those crimes by the state around july this year and a warrant was issued soon after . 

&gt;is the government try to stop him to be a president?

**No** . It easily looks like it and that's exactly what he&amp;co want you to think . The whole investigation started as back as 2017 ( Not mentioning the fact his channel was running without a licence since 2014 ).    

&gt;if he entre the jail, does that make a chaos between the people and the government?

I hope not , although it's quite risky considering how a lot of people genuinely support him thanks to 24/24 media&amp; politicians getting it all wrong or simply worrying they're next in this anti corruption campaign .

Moreover, how much access does the central bank have to the technology behind this digital currency? Are there Tunisian experts with enough knowledge in this field to verify the claims by the Russian company and ensure its safety? Or are they gonna take the company's word for that? 

It's also not clear from the article what kind of a deal did the central bank have with the Russian company, can the company impose higher fees on each transaction in the future?

* Gift cards (they sell them in local shops here, also there are plenty of new facebook pages that sells gift cards for almost everything (amazon, netflix, googleplay, PSN, steam, etc..)

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Another issue you need to keep in mind is that **most** sellers on Amazon don't ship to Tunisia, specially the heavy/high price items, i only bought books an ""basic"" stuff from Amazon (like good quality drawing pencils or an earphone), i would recomment eBay tbh, it works better for Tunisia and you can just directly contact the sellers, in my experience, eBay sellers are way faster to reply to you.

&amp;nbsp;

#DIWENA : 

ok so this is the most random shit in the country xD

In my experience (buying stuff online for the past 6 years), 

&amp;nbsp;

* You don't have to worry about cheap stuff  (food, clothes, low price electronics, etc..), for these you'll only pay a small fee at the post office (min is 5dt, max is 50dt (in my experience) ) 



&amp;nbsp;


*  If you're buying an expensive thing (like a phone) its much better to try to contact the seller and have him sent to you as a ""personal package"" (like a gift or something), and **ALWAYS** use the most expensive shipping method (DHL or FedEx); you'll receive your item and you'll usually pay 50dt in Rapid Post office (different than the standard post office)

&amp;nbsp;

* If you buy any device that has a network card in it, the device need to be tested by [this gov center](http://www.cert.tn/), your device will go there automatically, and if the test is passed (its a national security thing) you'll receive a ""letter"" (avis) that tells you that you need to pay 10dt to this center in the Custom office of the aiport (diwena), which is retarded lol, because after you pay that 10dt, you'll go home, and wait for the Rapid Post to bring you your item, and you'll get another letter (avis) to pick it up from your city when it arrives, this happened to me when i got my iphone5 years ago (i paid 60dt in total, 10dt for CERT and 50dt for rapid post)

&amp;nbsp;

* If you want to buy food, i advice that you buy in bulk, i frequently buy Korean and Japanese foods (ramen, noodles, etc..), i buy a lot from one seller (~$250) and he sent me a big package with FedEx, it arrives in like ~4 days. [Proof](https://i.imgur.com/Dsyr6hX.png), i bought a bunch of Korean food (from a Korean guy on eBay), they arrived in 3 days, and i only paid 25dt at the post office.

&amp;nbsp;

Edit:

the last time i explained this i got a shitload of PM asking me about all sort of random things, please don't do that, if you have any question just ask here and i'll answer it the same way i was gonna do it in PM, the only difference is here you may end up helping someone else.",2019-12-21 20:53:24

Police officers are usually pretty homophobic so that might cause problems. 
Bad things do happen , people get assaulted , harassed and arrested for being gay , about 50 people get arrested for sodomy every year. 
I know many openly gay tunisians and none of them has ever encountered trouble , mostly because tunisians don’t really think about it much , they just assume that everyone is straight.
The Trans situation is much better , people do get ridiculed and harassed but legally changing sex is feasible and has been done by multiple people , it’s just a slow long process.

And that France refused to give them back!

 The hypocrisy is that these guys who want a pure girl think that they are entitled as guys to sleep with as many girls as possible and at the end marry a nice (3a9la) girl. 

So it's tricky being a girl in this country. Try (if you can) to not give a shit about what people think about you because it will only make you miserable. 

If you are a conservative find a guy who shares these ideals and respects them, don't expect the majority to change. And if you are okay with having sex and all the other stuff, find a guy who doesn't make a big deal out of it and who want see you as an inferior girl afterwards.

esipfd9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/c7tc72/,11,"Hellow fellow psychology german student. Im a law student and i'm happy to help you with what i know on the matter. So about organ donations on the tunisian legal level we have :

&amp;#x200B;

\-It is organised with the law 25 march 1991 . pdf link in french  [http://www.atds.org.tn/JORT91.pdf](http://www.atds.org.tn/JORT91.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

\-Before this law , taking an organ from a person , alive or dead , without his consent , was illegal for any case. However , after 25 march 1991 , taking an organ from a dead body became actually possible in tunisian law even without consent , article 3 from the law 25 march 1991

\+actually , the person must state that he refuses any taking of his organs when he's dead .

\+the taking of dead body organs can only be done for ""therapeutic or scientific ends""

\+Some the dead person's family members can oppose this : children , father , mother , spouse , brothers , sisters or legal guardian (limitative list not enumerative)

&amp;#x200B;

\-As for the donation from an alive donnor , there some conditions :

\+The consent of the donnor . article 2 law 25 march 1991

\+the capicity of the donnor ( i dont know if this is the right term in english , in french it's ""capacité"" , meaning the ability of the person to choose what's wrong / right = not crazy , not minor ...) . same article

\+that the donnor is previously informed of the consequences of the operation on both him , and the one benefiting from his organ. article 7 from the law 25 march 91

\+the expression of the consent of the donnor is done under the judge supervision and according to official formalities . article 8 same law

\+The donnor can take back his decision at any moment and without any formalities . meaning that the formailities are only necessary for the expression of the consent , but he can take it back freely and with no conditions . article 9 same law

&amp;#x200B;

\-Moreover , tunisian legislation has some other limits concerning organ donations :

\+The organ donation from a living person cannont be for a scientific end , but only in the context of medical operation that will help another person

\+The donation of organ necessary for life is prohibited. meaning the organs that would kill the donnor when donated . article 4 of the law 25 march 1991

\+the donation of the reproductive organs is also prohibited. article 5 of the same law , and the law of 7 august 2001 in the article 14.

\+the donation of an organ in exchange for money is strictly prohibited. Organ donations can only be in a free context . Actually , tunisian  legislation gives great importance to the integrity of the human body , and does not consider it as an object ""in the trade"" = "" dans le commerce"" . meaning the human body , as a whole or as organs , is not at all a property to buy or to sell, even if the person is willing to do so. This is confirmed in the article 2 of the law of 3 august 2006 , and also the article 62 of the code of obligations and contracts ,  inspired from the article 16-5 of the french civil code . therfore any contract envolving an organ or the human body under illegal conditions is nullified.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this is clear , feel free to ask if you have any other questions.

&amp;#x200B;

edited :some spelling  mistakes

edit 2 :

&amp;#x200B;

So i reread your post, can you give me the 2004 law you mentionned , cause we've passed this theme this year and i dont remember it . i also checked a book and it wasn't mentionned.

&amp;#x200B;

Also , since you're a psychology student , are you looking for the organ donation behaviour from a psychological level , or are you going to deduct this behaviour from the legal texts ? cause what i gave you is mainly technical , but i've got a book on the matter and it does have some arguments on why the tunisian legilator opted for this kind of choice .",2019-07-01 21:49:49

You can also check out http://www.tecnocasa.tn/  They are a professional real estate company that I've used in the past and do a good job.  They have property listings on their site, but I think your best bet would be to email them directly and tell them what you're looking for.

eojbw80,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/bs1yc8/,10,"I am a Tunisian high schooler and the system is quite flawed, First of all we have under qualified teachers who don't have a clue of what they are doing. Secondly the level of French and English lessons is pretty stagnant from 9th grade onwards. We don't  learn anything new. We also just keep learning things that won't really help us in the future. For example learning how to properly write a letter would be better than analyzing 500 AC poetry. Furthermore there is no emphasis on speaking foreign languages fluently so they can be used in business effectively. You may even find the teachers speaking bad English and French. There are also social subjects (History/Geography/Civic education/Islamic education) that we just do to keep teachers working. I don't mean that these subjects must not be taught but we should change how we teach them to make them interesting and almost like a hobby with an emphasis on making the student understand more the world around him and not just vomit useless information to only forget them a day later. I'd like to add that contrary to the us we follow the French system of filières that even France got rid of. You can't learn relatively advanced levels of maths and just a little bit of economy if you want to learn more about economy.Finally I want to point out that I leave in the city so for the countryside these problems are icing on the cake of bad infrastructure and far schools and non existant teachers (they all want to live in cities).",2019-05-23 18:23:02

It is almost everyone's dream here to **escape** Tunisia and live in Europe, and i truly means **escape**, people see that as a big achievements, it is very very common for folks to live a miserable daily life in Europe doing shitty jobs, just to come here during the summer to feel superior and brag about ""living the dream"".

It is also 99% expected that if a Tunisian get married to a western foreigner, then they will end up living in that western country, i really hate to be the one who's gonna tell you this (and i hope am wrong) but you need to be sure that your wife loves **YOU** and not love you **AND** your citizenship. 

Am not saying that she married you for the papers, but, if one of the main elements that she loved about you is your western origin, and if her vision of a happy life with you is in France, then i think its gonna be impossible to change her mind, especially if she doesn't have any real challenges/achievements in Tunisia, and am talking about a profession here, her social ""ranking"" is very important, because there is a big chance that her entire self-esteem is built around the idea of being married to a Frenchman, which mean she'll eventually become a Frenchwoman, who is ready to live that ""meh"" life in France, just to feel superior when she visit Tunisia in the summer.

*Source:* 

I know someone who lived the exact same story, but it was Italy, they sticked together because she was pregnant and he opened a business (makeup shop) for her in Tunisia, but they eventually got divorced, and she married another Italian and ended up living in Italy. 


&amp;nbsp; 


I truly hope your case will never reach that, but you should ask her, this is almost an existential issue for her, if her entire future life is planned around the idea of coming back to Tunisia as a tourist, then its gonna be super hard for you to change her mind.

ew6ol3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/cn4aud/,10,"Islamophobic is a big word. We're far from that. But let me start with the very same sentence you ended on : you do not have to agree with everyone on the planet. Including people who attach terrorist stereotypes to people with long beards. I am against stereotyping people. But on the other hand I can see why such things happen in our society. We need more examples of you. We need proof that practising muslims who choose to reflect this on their appearance aren't  terrorist. 
But for the most part, in the recent few years there was always a ""bearded"" person behind most terrorist attacks (either directly or indirectly). So a lot of tunisian people, and a large part of the world, sadly started making this association. 
So let me get back to that last sentence of yours: you don't need to agree with people who show such behaviour. But you share the same society with them, and you should understand the way they see things, even if they don't try to understand your point of view first (treat people as you wish to be treated) Once you do understand it, you either chose to adapt (by adjusting your appearance for example) or not to do anything about it while accepting the different treatment you will get from this society. 
I AM NOT ASKING YOU TO HIDE YOUR IDENTITY OR FAITH, I am asking you to realize that this is not about islam, it is about appearence. And the best proof is the following :
if you are a tunisian in your 20s / 30s, don't have a beard, dress as a ""typical"" working educated person (shirt and pants..) and overall look and dress smart, and on top of all of this, pray everyday, you will be regarded as a good example by most of our society, the only difference is that the person I imagined doesnt have a beard and doesnt wear a قميص. Add those two elements and our society will (sadly )instantly label you as a potential threat, eveb if you are a bright mind, the beard and قميص will show first.
Islamophobia is fear of islam. We don't fear islam, we  have لحيةفوبيا. Because we associate that with radical islam and that is to be feared.

eipchny,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/b1zkvh/,9,"I've written up a mloukhia recipe for an American friend once, so here it is, enjoy -  sorry for US measurements, I had to change them so she'd understand :)

&amp;#x200B;

Mloukhia (mlookheeea)

Ingredients:

⦁	100 grams of mloukhia powder

⦁	2/3 cup of olive oil

⦁	1/2 gallon (or so) of warm/hot water

⦁	2 dried bay leaves

⦁	1.5 lbs (or so) of meat (beef stew meat or lamb stew meat, cut into 1 inch cubes)

⦁	1/2 tablespoon of ground caraway (or tabil if you have)

⦁	1 tablespoon of ground coriander (don't add if you use tabil).

⦁	5 (or so) minced up garlic cloves

⦁	2-3 tablespoons of tomato paste

⦁	1 tablespoon of harissa (if you can find it! Otherwise use a little cayenne pepper powder for a little spicyness)

⦁	Pinch of dried mint

⦁	Salt, pepper

&amp;#x200B;

*Beware, mloukhia will stain your clothes. And you're supposed to use a wooden spoon - I don't know why.*

&amp;#x200B;

In a large pot with medium heat, mix mloukhia powder and olive oil till they make a paste (it may be runny, or thick, or whatever, who cares, just mix them on some heat till all the powder has incorporated. I've added too much oil before and swore at it, but at the end you'll be able to spoon out the extra if it's too much. No biggie. There just needs to be enough for the powder to blend in well with the oil. I have no idea why we need to do this.

Add water. The actual amount doesn't really matter at first, you can always add more later if needed, and I have no idea why it's supposed to be warm when you add it in. Add about 1.5 -2 litres. I've let my mloukhia sit to evaporate too much water before. It's easy. Or I've added more. Yay cooking.

Add bay leaves. Let simmer uncovered (or covered, whatever, depends on how much water you put) on medium-low for a couple of hours. Your house will smell like weed. Enjoy. I make sure to stir it every once in a while (mostly in the beginning) to make sure there isn't goopy powder stuck to the bottom of the pot and to check if it's not burning. If it starts to have the consistency of snot, that's ok, it'll get better.

When the stew looks smooth, no more snot consistency, and, and is slightly thicker (slightly, like... barely thicker than ramen broth), and it may have some dark green oil deposits on top, it's time to add the good shit.

MEAT.

Put all your meat chunks in a large bowl. Add to the bowl all ingredients else under meat. Stir it all in with the meat. You can choose to let the meat sit like this in the fridge for a while, or not. I've done both and have never tasted a difference. You can add more than a pinch of dried mint, it gives a good taste if you enjoy mint. If not, don't put it in. Don't forget your salt!!! 

*You can probably put all these ingredients separately directly into the stew. I've never done it but logically it's the same damn thing, I'm just stuck on tradition. Don't let my grandma see this.*

Dump the meat into the pot, and stir. Now, it cooks until the meat is tender and falls apart easily and you start seeing more dark green oil deposits on the top (this is when you can skim some of the oil off if there's too much to your liking). Depending on the meat, that can take an extra 3-4 hours. Let it cook till it has ""I can pick this shit it up with some good baguette pieces and enough will stick to it till I get it to my mouth."" Taste test for SALT!

At this point, eat it. I've left my pot of mloukhia sit on my stove for like 2-3 days. I reheat it everyday, add water as needed, and just eat it with bread. It just gets better with age. Towards the end, it'll be so mushy, and the meat will have completely fallen apart it'll look like black goopy porridge and you can eat it with a fork, best fucking thing ever. I'm so hungry right now.

*If anyone tells you that you should eat it on rice kick them in the balls.*

Enjoy! Let me know if you have any questions.

ep0b9gs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/bth85w/,9,"One thing is the relationship to fascism by French colonizers in the 30s and 40s.  Although a lot of people in MENA, Europe, and North America tend to refer to anything authoritarian as ""fascist"" (""Ben Ali was fascist,"" ""Mubarak was fascist,"" ""Donald Trump is fascist,"" ""Morsi was fascist,"" ""al-Sisi is fascist,"" ""Saddam Hussein was fascist,"" etc. etc. etc.), fascist is better understood by historians as revolutionary, populist ultranationalism fighting for ""national rebirth"" often relying on imagined conceptions of a distant past.  For the Nazis, this was pagan Germany and Scandinavia; for the Italian Fascists, this was the Roman Empire; etc.  However, there was also a strong fascist movement in France that nearly took down the legislature in February 1934.  Their conception of the past was based on the Old Regime, before the French Revolution.

Now, these French fascists were enormously active in North Africa, where they framed themselves as being more ""truly French"" than even those living in metropolitan France.  This was based on the idea of a perceived connection with the land (which is laughable, as settlers had almost total control over land ownership but did very little to actually work it), as well as a sense of ""Latin"" unity (based on language ties with Italians, Maltese, Spanish, etc.).  Now, not all French colonizers were fascist, but a huge number of them were.  These people were the first to welcome the Vichy regime in June 1940, and went on to perpetuate a number of assassinations of republican French leaders (a close friend of Edouard Daladier, president of France as war broke out in 1939, was assassinated by members of the Parti populaire français--a French fascist party--, for example).  More than even republican French leaders, they absolutely despised Destour and Neo-Destour, doing everything they could to crush the movement.  While the Popular Front was in power (1936-1938), I have a document where Victor Arrighi--director of the Parti populaire français in North Africa--states that ""if the government had on its head a man of the PPF, the career of Bourguiba and his acolytes would end in ten minutes.""  In spite of the brutality perpetrated against anti-colonial nationalists, the PPF's problem was that the colonial administration *was not brutal enough*.

Hilariously, I have some police records from 1937 of one PPF meeting, where an undercover police officer was spying on them and ran into a few members afterwards in a café.  One PPF member was shouting that fascists need to rebel against the French administration (obviously so they could be even more brutal in Tunisia than they already were), but the police officer was not so upset about that in itself.  Instead, he wrote up an angry report calling for this PPF member's arrest because there was a Tunisian in the café, and the police did not want Tunisians to ""get any ideas"" (as though they weren't already there lmao).

None of this is surprising, because French colonization was one fucked up thing, but to me it illuminates how central Tunisia was to the battle of ideas taking place in interwar Europe and the Mediterranean.

It's some really interesting stuff and I'm hoping to document it all in a book sometime in the next few years.",2019-05-27 16:07:06

More than backward theocracies use that language. The US has ""in god we trust"" in plenty of places like its currency. England has an official church and the queen is the head of that church. Plenty of european kingdoms have official churches as well. Don't forget about backward communist regimes and atheist states like china or the soviet union.

As these inforamants are hated by tunisian, they called them ""ta7ana"" (because of the flour bag they wear) as a slur.

f0smqu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/d6fcg8/,9,"Hi, to put things back in their context. Tunisian society is divided between very progressive communities and very conservative ones. This seems to reflect the state of religion in the country as well since you will find a lot of atheists who tend to be as you described: accepting of LGBT, won't see issues with couples living together before marriage or with premarital sex.

The majority are still Muslims and will frown upon such ""haram"" behavior. Homosexuality is still a crime in Tunisia, equality in inheritance still hasn't been voted in parliament with a lot of people voicing their concern that this would be against Islam which is the state's official religion (even though the constitution still guarantees freedom of belief to its people theoretically).

I personally have been living with my girlfriend for the past 3 years. But we had to do it secretly, her family wouldn't accept it, there is still a chance that neighbors would call the police to report us, we can't possibly share a hotel room neither if we want to take some holidays far from our city. Since basically police regard an unmarried couple engaging in premarital sex while living together as a form of prostitution (which is illegal) and that happened to friends of ours in the past where they were brought to the police office for questioning.

Basically, if we do get caught, police would try to get my girlfriend to admit to me getting her gifts which are then considered a form of payment I gave her in exchange for sexual favors.

We do have many friends that support us and think like us though. Basically you could say that about 25-40% of the younger population in big cities (especially the capital) are progressive and tend to behave the way they want. They just need to be discrete about it.",2019-09-19 15:36:34

*By Safwan Masri, executive vice-president at Columbia University, author of ‘Tunisia: An Arab Anomaly’*

In Tunisia, the fate of the Arab world’s only democratic, secular state hangs in the balance. A parliamentary election is scheduled for October 6, and a runoff presidential election will follow. But its democratic experiment is at risk of unravelling.

In 2011, Tunisians were ecstatic about ousting dictatorial president Zein al-Abidine Ben Ali and replacing him with a government that would deliver freedom, democracy and, most crucially for citizens in the neglected interior, bread. Eight years on, Tunisians have freedom and democracy — but still not enough bread. Frustrated by sluggish economic reform, voters last month rebuked the incumbents and the compromises that dominated the democracy’s first phase.

In the first round of presidential elections, two anti-establishment candidates emerged as the leading contenders: Kais Saied, an independent constitutional law professor, and Nabil Karoui, a flamboyant media tycoon running a populist campaign from prison, where he awaits trial on charges of tax evasion and money laundering.

The next round will present to the citizens of this small North African nation starkly divergent future visions. Mr Saied wants to rewrite the constitution to give greater power to local councils. He opposes recent progressive reform proposals to repeal sharia inheritance laws that punish widows and daughters, and dismantle laws that harshly punish same-sex activity.

Mr Karoui, the imprisoned businessman, is by temperament more authoritarian than socially progressive. If he won, he would be likely to consolidate greater powers into the presidency.

Tunisia’s transition into a stable, mature democracy is still possible, if the nation’s voters and leaders embrace the notion that democracy is messy, unpredictable and occasionally antagonistic. But the leading presidential candidates, who have no previous government experience, will need to acquire tolerance for uncertainty.

Back in 2010, eight of the 22 countries that make up the League of Arab States saw revolts against authoritarian regimes. Tunisia is the only one where democracy survives, with free and fair elections. But gross domestic product per capita remains shy of $3,500, the cost of living is up sharply, and unemployment rates remain unacceptably high. If forced to choose, many voters are likely to opt for the literal nourishment of economic stability over the intellectual nourishment offered by John Locke or Thomas Jefferson.

Tunisia’s authoritarian Arab neighbours, who want to see democracy contained, preferably quelled, are watching closely. After deposing Ben Ali, who died this month, Tunisians transitioned quickly toward democratic, civil institutions. This stands in contrast with Algeria and Sudan, where citizens have toppled dictators but not entrenched military institutions, and Egypt, which is ruled by a dictatorship more authoritarian than the one ousted in 2011.

The future of Tunisia’s fragile democracy rests primarily in the hands of the Tunisians. But Gulf state strongmen will continue vying for influence, through foreign investment and direct financial support for Tunisia’s internal political parties. No one would be more delighted if the country descended into chaos post-elections.

The west can help via investment. But it must transcend past practices, which saw the coastal regions capture the bulk of funding from the IMF, World Bank and others. This must change or disenfranchised citizens in the interior may be unable to resist the lure of desperate actions. The west should also recognise that one of the best-educated populations in the Arab world is hungry for partnerships. They are in a unique position to create jobs, exchange knowledge and contribute to development and long-term stability. Tunisians crave democracy, but they demand progress. We should want the same.",2019-09-27 11:23:03

f1vmgzc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/daok38/,9,"Here... I am way too weird. I am going to explain (as far as my understanding goes) and post more or less the issues &amp; a plan for actual solutions in Tunisia:

&amp;#x200B;

Issue : Tunisia has basically declared that its currency will keep inflating with its fiscal policies .

Here :  [https://www.bct.gov.tn/bct/siteprod/tableau\_statistique\_a.jsp?params=PL203105&amp;la=AN](https://www.bct.gov.tn/bct/siteprod/tableau_statistique_a.jsp?params=PL203105&amp;la=AN)

You can see that the TMM of Tunisia is increasing year by year. It recently slightly decreased prior to the election. This is like telling everyone that the inflation rate will still be high/get higher. (except right before the elections) You can read the explanation in the spoiler .

&gt;!When you take a loan, part of the interest rate belongs to the central bank (because it gives money to the banks). The %age that belongs to the central bank is called the TMM. (This is not exact but is meant to be very simplified). When you take a loan, if the central bank expects the value of the money to get much lower, it will increase the TMM so that it still get its money (in terms of value) back.!&lt;

&gt;!Think of it this way (simplified): If you take a 1000 dinar loan with a 2% yearly interest rate yet the inflation rate is about 10%. The bank will be losing the 8% difference instead of winning it.!&lt;

&gt;!Thus if the bank increases the interest rate to \~12%, it will be winning money.!&lt;

&gt;!But the bank doesnt really know how high the inflation rate will be. The central bank, however, does. Thus if the central bank increases its interest rates (and thus the TMM), it means that the dinar's value is going to further decrease !&lt;

This is read by investors as ""DO NOT INVEST IN TUNISIA, YOU ARE GOING TO LOSE MONEY"", hence the terrible economy that we have.

The solution (and it's by no means easy) is to change this message. First, take out a loan. Though this might sound like a terrible idea, a loan to restructure the economy with an actual plan presented and accepted by the IMF is usually a good sign.

Next use that money in two key spots.

\- Apply the ISO 9001 regulation in public services.

\- Digitize most of the official process.

I have contacts in the public sector, so I m positive that ISO 9001 is not currently applied. As for the second point, though it is being done, the pace is extremely slow.

The first is due to the Tunisian mentality (Why should we write what we re currently doing? It's much more work. Why not working instead?)

The second is due to a lack of will. Digitalizing means more transparency. Many people just dont want that.

Anyway, those 2 points will earn any politician hate from the public services but will significantly improve transparency, efficiency &amp; investors' trust

The money loaned is not much (Especially since the EU/IMF are big fans of the ISO 9001) &amp; the work mostly requires human resources so it will probably decrease unemployement a bit.

The rest of the loan (if there is) is to be saved . It will be used to reduce the TMM.

Next are the strikes. The easiest way to deal with those is to push up a controversial subject. Something like Homosexuality or equal inheritence are indeed great on that aspect . (Which is why our dear presidents candidates are talking a lot about those even if the laws arent changed). It should also have a positive impact on Tunisia's public image which should help.

Ideally, the president should be as charismatic as possible and try to interact more with the rest of the world (again, for the sake of Trust).

TLDR : Ofc, not a single person (Neither the public nor private sector nor even the people) will like such a party  political party.

Which is why not a single sane person would try to actually help out the country.

Instead, our people want a hero on a white horse ""rescuing the country"" ! Or else blame the jews or the gays.",2019-09-29 16:02:59

No Government can magically fix this.

This is why the Finance Ministry has created an import tax to dissuade individuals from massively importing expensive things and to encourage local manufacturing. This is also why there is no PayPal. 

One solution comes from increasing exports (Tourists, Products) or the value of exports. But to impose higher prices, you must provide much higher quality.

In my humble opinion, it is better to try to find a compromise and not always get what you want, than risk having someone in the presidency that can steamroll ahead just to have everything undone when the next administration takes office. We should try to distribute power rather than concentrate it.

f8bztgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/e00kwp/,9,"The Economy is shit for several reasons:

-Poor quality of Tunisian exports (low value added exports: olive oil, textile, electrical wires ....). These exports are labor intensive but not technology intensive, which means the value added is low. Which means these exports won't bring in enough foreign currency (we don;t export a lot of raw materials and even phosphate exports are stalling). Also these exports are very dependent on the mood of the countries we export to. IE, they can stop buying from us on a whim and as they wish. Our exports are not too importent to them.

-Too much imports. Some of the imports are necessary like capital goods (machines, cars, trucks...) and energy products (oil ...). Other imports are inputs that go into producing our shitty exports (wires and textile). The rest is useless shit that we don't need, but our consumers demand because the products are available on the market (per trade agreements imposed on us, or hitting our markets through contraband or illegal imports). I am talking about french chocolate, British alcohol, German chewing gum, Italian soap ...etc.

-To cover the difference between imports and exports the Tunisian government is borrowing excessively. So we have excessive indebtedness. 

-The structure if our economy is bad. We rely on exports to employ workers and pay them low salaries, but our local industrial fabric is poor. Our local businesses have been decimated by unfair competition and most of them closed down.  

-we also rely on Tourism as a source of foreign currency and for employment. But international tourism is a drain of our ressources, it employs poor paying jobs and it uses excessive water, food and transportation, which we all lack and mostly need to import. It is a catch 22. 

-We also lack rigor in our industrial, commercial and work environment. We are not disciplined and we lack a vision at the national level for where we want to be.


-Anyway...we are FUCKED. Unless we completely change the way our economy works and move it from an economy that mostly relies on the outside world (exports, imports, foreign indebtedness, tourism ...etc, all combined are more than 100% of our GDP). The local economy needs to be encouraged such that , for example, if France decided not to buy our olive oil, we don't get fucked that year.",2019-11-22 18:58:43

You can go through the Suk on your own and Tunisians are very friendly, but a local can often get you better prices. Also, visit the Bardo museum, it's amazing.

I would take the train to Sidi Bou Said and walk around (great views, good restaurants). LaMarsa has some decent beaches and is only 15-25 min from Tunis (near Sidi Bou Said). We're not talking Malibu beaches here, but they're nice. If you're in LaMarsa, there's a traditional cafe called Saf Saf that's worth visiting. There's also a great burger joint called Doodle Burger, if you're craving Western food at some point. The guy who runs Doodle Burger is super nice. 

If you have time, I would recommend you find a Tunisian and head south of Tunis to see Roman ruins. There are areas in the rural countryside where the Roman ruins make Rome's artifacts look like child's play. You might need a local to help you find them and to avoid problems with rural police. You could be fine on your own, I don't know. But I wouldn't chance it. There are areas in the south of the country that are not safe to travel in, but don't let people scare you off traveling outside of Tunis just because some areas on the border or dangerous.

First Tunisia and the US were very close allies up to 1985, with Bourguiba being close to most US presidents before Reagan. Moving the PLO headquartes to Tunis was a direct request from the US, who until the very last day reassured Tunisia that they were safe from any attack so they didn't think about it twice. After the attack Bourguiba saw them as traitors and the relationship was never the same again. It's silly to blame Bourguiba when a certain country has a free pass to send fighter jets and bomb asylum seekers and civilians in the other side of the mediteranean, and still gets away with claiming it's for self-defense. Second how do you spread both arabization and ""french neo-colonialism"" in the same time ? Assuming that's the case of course which isn't, Bourguiba being one of the main reasons Tunisia got its independance in the first well as well as making France leave Bizerte too in 1963. Neo-colonialism is a modern thing, at that point of time proper colonialism still existed. And lastly there is no need to be arab to be on Palestine's side.

The German occupation was a life-shattering event for him. He and his Jewish friends were rounded up and taken to forced labor camps on the front. As they were marched through the streets of Tunis, the Arab people mocked them and cheered for the Germans taking away their Jews. My grandfather was shocked by this, since he considered himself just as Tunisian as everyone else. He couldn't understand how the children he grew up with were now happy to see him go. At that moment he realized he didn't belong, and became a Zionist. He eventually escaped from the camp, and when the German occupation ended, he made his way to Palestine in 1945. He was one of the founders of Kibbutz Regavim in Israel, which had a large community of Tunisian Jews. Most Jews left Tunisia after 1948, when anti-Israel sentiment caused problems for the Jewish community.

My grandfather died last year, but he always had fond memories of Tunisia (unlike my Algerian grandmother, who always hated Algeria). He returned to visit three times when Tunisia-Israel relations got better, starting in the late 90's. I visited with him in 2009, and had an amazing time in your lovely country. Everyone was very nice, and the food was amazing. I hope I get to visit again one day!

So many quality resources exist for every language and we should try to use them as much as we can.  
I don't get what you're getting at. The main reason English is currently the lingua franca is because the British Empire once colonized most of the world.  
Does that mean all the countries that were at one point in time colonized by the British should stop using English? Do you think we should stop using Arabic and French and go back to our original language from before the Arabization of our country? Go back to using one of the remaining Berber languages? Or do you think we should abandon all our languages entirely and just use English as an official language?  
Also, one thing you fail to understand is that the process of evolving a language or changing it entirely occurs naturally over time. There is currently a big portion of our people that don't understand MSA let alone French or English. How do you expect them to deal with the sudden change in language?",2019-09-07 05:01:14

Some people like to look back when its not going well and remember only the good things under ben ali and bourguiba. They are being nostalgic or maybe even benefited indirectly. Nahdha, as far as i know, at the beginning were more of an anti colonialization movement focusing on tunisian culture and focused especially on religion. I personally dont have a problem with that if its in a peaceful way and respecting others way of living. That was not always the case. But i have a big problem with them just failing for 8 years now to do something good for tunisians beside talking. I think they belong to history like ben ali. DONT GET INTO THIS FIGHT. The world is not about Nahdha and Ben Ali and his followers. They both live from this fight. Trying to devide tunisian people. There are alot of politians, parties and indepedents.

Is 3+ months of jail a form of freedom to you? 
Because that's the current penalty for homosexuality in Tunisia.

&gt; I actually think that there are a few true gay people in Tunisia. 

You can download and check out Grindr (gay chat app) for yourself. It couldn't be farther from the truth. 
Those that can afford to usually go to Europe though.

&gt; he just pointed out that outer forces paid money to encourage this phenomena to exist.

Yeah, ofc the whole story about the evil zionists trying to make everyone gay so as to destroy religion blablabla. 

Seriously, how can a professor believe that BS? 
Lgbt people just want the right to live in peace like everyone else. 

How come any attempt at doing so is perceived as a zionist attack while lgbt people are the ones getting discriminated against, jailed and humiliated en masse? This is mind-blowing.

&gt; The only Tunisian people who believe that gay people should have rights (gay marriage etc..) are either paid to encourage it or are simply affected by the new concept of freedom that embodies in fake freedoms such as the mirath thing, women rights that only consider freedom of dressing and forgets about the working women in the fields and the examples keep on going. 

This kind of thinking is why I won't ever go back to this country. 

""Not now, first let's focus on the economy""

You know you can change the law and the economy at the same time, right? 

You know that changing the law requires no money, right? 

You know that it can have a good impact on the economy, right? (Having laws of a developed country is a sign of stability that encourages investment which is literally what our country needs most)

Have you checked the figures and the fiscal policy of Tunisia for yourself? I did, and though I am no economist, I could see that many things were wrong. I could list them here but I wonder if there's even a point in doing so ...

fajyvq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/e9kryx/,8,"**Neocolonialism**

Neocolonialism, neo-colonialism, or neo-imperialism is the practice of using capitalism, globalisation and cultural imperialism to influence a developing country instead of the previous colonial methods of direct military control (imperialism) or indirect political control (hegemony). Coined by the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre in 1956, it was first used by Kwame Nkrumah in the context of African countries undergoing decolonisation in the 1960s. Neo-colonialism is also discussed in the works of Western thinkers such as Jean-Paul Sartre (Colonialism and Neo-colonialism, 1964) and Noam Chomsky (The Washington Connection and Third World Fascism, 1979).

eupev4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/ch4xqn/,7,"Are you a history/culture/sports/hiking enthousiaste...? What kind of things do you like?

In Sfax, the old city (Medina) is nice and very old (some parts are from the 800s, other parts from the 1300s). It is not very big so you can really go outside of the major souks into the small orthogonal streets and let yourself be ""lost"" for a moment. There are two museums in the Médina and one just outside: the Kasba museum, Dar Jallouli museum and the Municipal museum. If you are Muslim you can visit the Big Mosque, which one of the oldest still used mosques in Tunisia (the 800s). In the Médina you can also find the best restaurants for traditional Sfaxian cuisine, one can say food is the most important part of Sfaxian cultural identity (that and the accent! :))

Ten kilometers to the South of Sfax, you can find Thyna, which is an old Roman city located on the beach. There are not many monuments still identifiable, but the visit is a good opportunity for a small hike.

I also recommend visiting the Archipelago of Kerkennah : it has the charm of the places that feel out of the time. There are beaches. They are not the best in Tunisia, but you can swim there when the tides are favorable (ask the locals if the ""Sea is living/dead""). There are many nice hikes to do in Kerkennah, and you can also do some touristy stuff like go on a tour on a local fishing boat (you can even combine this with a restaurant where you can then eat the fish you just caught!).

If you are more mobile, in a circle of 100-200 kms there are the cities of Gabes, El Djem, Mahdia, Sousse, Monastir all worth the visit.",2019-07-24 08:13:33

evjht1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/cjyw76/,7,"  Well  it’s very easy to understand Tunisian political landscape: The only effort to make, is to learn which from the now more than 250 parties were (or are) built on a religious background.

Since the notion of right and left wings lists political movements, parties are categorized from religious ones on the right to laïcs on the left.

Then the more parties defend radical ideas the more they are positionned on the edge of their own wings, and thus are called whether far right (religious parties ) or far left wings. (socialist to communist parties).

But note that in Tunisia like elsewhere (in countries where elections take place) parties are more and more claiming a third political mainstream which is the centre.

In fact it’s just a happy medium between both wings that may let parties broaden their electoral bases, through picking up right and left what seem in their eyes as the best while offering them a back door to escape from any criticism about those unsuitable positions which usually are characteristic to the wing they originally belong to.

To be brief ennahadha is the most known right wing movement whereas nida tounes tahia tounes qalb tounes are left wing as well as aljabha aschaabia (which in turn is on the left of these 2 latter).

Yet the real dilemma in Tunisia remains the huge number of independent candidates because they may benefit from a potentially massive sanction vote against political parties consequently to their popular rejection.

Considering this and seeing the precarious political stability, the next parliament main political tendency may stay unclear for weeks and may finally lead to some major issues.",2019-07-31 08:46:10

The French however are a different case, they came to Tunisia not to integrate with the locals and become one nation but rather to make Tunisia into France's food basket, Tunisians were never treated equally and they were always treated like subhumans and second class citizens and even wanted to replace the natives with French people

But after all, that's all history and so we need to move on and that's the problem, the current government still want to keep that French era alive, where people are forced to neglect their, again, native languages in favor of French, i'm not against learning French language but against harming the language we were born with, all languages must be treated equally and as for our economy, we need to make our economy bigger, not simply giving it up to the French, we need to make new beneficial deals with other countries like Russia or the US, the world is bigger than France, you know

And again, I'm not Francophobe, i'm simply a nationalist and want things to be done fairly, French Tunisians are natives to this country just like Tunisian with Arab or Carthaginian ancestry and every Tunisian have to be treated like the others and not favoring a particular group or language, hopefully my points are clear",2019-11-02 11:48:59

1) Tunisia : our country still the country of the beaches and tourism unfortunately , so  it's too difficult for the foreign people to settle and live in tunisia , because , there are no advanced techno services , they will just find some 5 stars hotels that barely offer the services of a 5stars hotel. Also , the definition of a city here doesn't exist. For example, when you take a tour toward some of the provinces of The state of nabeul or any random state you'll just find a simple map of  a town ( two or one mosque, small shops that sell the requirements like food supply ,  clothes and other primitive supplies and a number of the houses of the actual habitants)(By the way we barely have 3 cities) , this is the actual global architecture of our country.and that's what makes the Tunisians migrate to the capital.
2) your subject:
There are two kind of people in Tunisia , the first kind are the unemployed ones.those people always complain about the system(the education,the employment process,etc) in Tunisia, because they didn't make it in life..so they believe that if they only escaped the country illegally or legally , they will find their chances abroad.
The second kind of people , they are workers(doctors, engineers,...) in tunisia , but they find that their wages doesn't qualify to the standard of the living , they always find other opportunities abroad that have better wages.",2019-11-10 09:44:40

Yes only viruses and bacteria cause us to get sick. So technically cold air does not directly make us sick. 

[BUT, exposure to cold weather negatively impact our immune response](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/scientists-finally-prove-cold-weather-makes-sick/). Our bodies have a hard time fighting illnesses when we are cold. It is assumed that the body needs to work harder to keep it's core heated appropriately during cold temperatures. That extra work makes our immune system less effective at fighting the random virus or bacteria that happens to be around (and that otherwise would be dealt with without the person getting sick).

That being said, there is an exaggeration in our culture about this ""Courant d'Air""...

Eco fellas tended to be just like your average Tunisian aka swinging both ways . Scientific branches on the other hand were usually more liberal.

1/ Find a good cam : This is the first step. Well you can start up by taking photos using your phone but the quality is substantually better when using a professional camera.. search the Internet about cams, reviews, functions, etc... I recommend you NOT TO BUY it from Tunisia because it will cost much more than you order it from abroad ( ofc if you have a relative living out of the country) but anyways I'm sure you will find a good deal

2/learn the principles : here again Internet is your good friend, I'm sure there are so so many tutorials out there.. But if you know some professtional you can always learn from him

3/Practice and practice and practice : you won't have the perfect shot in one shot, practice makes perfect

Well to answer your questions : First of all, I wouldn't say Tunisia is a secular country, maybe on paper it is but religion is very omnipresent and as a fellow atheist, I wouldn't advise you to be totally free in your speech or actions. 

About the universities, if you wish to pursue computer science, I'm not totally sure but other people would be better suited to answer you one the comments, there is 1) INSAT ( institut des sciences appliquées de Tunis) but I'm not sure you get the diploma of an engineer in CS. 2) you do 2 years of ""prépa"" and then sit for a national exam and depending on your results you can choose an engineering university to pursue 3 years in it.

Some of those schools have a good reputation internationally, a lot of the students go abroad to do the master thesis but you have to check that. 

Cost wise, I have no idea about how it is in Algeria and I don't know about the rent prices of the student housing so maybe other people here can answer your questions :)

ejqbtes,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/b7abpv/,6,"**Hello there**

&gt;politically stable secular country

I would honestly suggest waiting a bit more before taking a decision on this because the way I see it Algeria is currently experiencing some sort of revolution that could put you people on an actually good path ( Maybe a transition to democracy similar to ours except with less economical difficulties ) or it could simply lead to the same regime staying in power without much change ( aka similar to Egypt ) .I know that we're often portrayed as the most secular / Democractic etc country in the arab world but don't think of it as anywhere close to European or generally modern countries ( inb4 downvotes ) . There's also elections coming up and while I doubt that it'll create any turmoil I would still try to take that into account .

&gt;how well is this uni recognized internationally?

AFAIK the ones in the capital + a couple more cities mainly on the coast are pretty good and definitely recognized internationally .

&gt;Also how is people's mentality regarding religion? How do people treat atheists? How are they seen by the norm?

Most wouldn't care but honestly I would suggest refraining from publicly acknowledging that .

-if you want to make money, the easiest way is to learn javascript, you can learn it and start building web pages etc..
Payton is a great language, but if you wanna make money you must invest a looot of time before you can really make an app that's competitive and u can make money throw it.

-I was a baccalaureate in science, I studied Pascal also..
Let's be honest 99%of Tunisian proffesor are loser /bullshetters
If you wanna learn something you do have Google in front of you, use it!!!
I'm a student in one of the best universities in the field of technologies in Tunisia, and I can tell you that you will learn just 1% of what the average European /America /Asian(I highly recommend to go study abroad).
-I've been in go my code and I have my friends working there,its a good place to get inspiration but you can't learn how to code just by getting trained there!

The only way to be a good programmer  is SELF LEARNING!!!

my piece of advice for you is to build a self discipline, motivation come and go but self D will help you to get things done.

If you look at the average tax rate in a country and how democratic it is, you will quickly see a negative correlation.

So basically, on average, monarchs and dictators ""steal"" more than democracies.

Easy example was when Bourguiba made many farms/lands state owned. He received an unbelievable high equivalent tax rate.

&gt; Democracy only creates inconvenience, nothing is accomplished, unity begins to fall, parties fight, laws and legislation are stalled due to different parties’ views. 

This is usually the result of a badly designed political structure rather than a ""democracy"".

Western countries get things done, and they are all democracies.

Actually, I guess studying in pioneer college+highschool helped me a lot to achieve 18, I dont know how to describe it well but if you are sourrounded by people who are tying their best to get good marks and so, you will indirectly get good marks like them too. Uhhhh, to be honest im not that good at school, I am always ranked in the last 5 pupils in the class except my bac year I got placed 13/23. (was 15th at the beginning of the year). And im playing league since my 7th class. 
At the beginning of the year, I got addicted to fortnite so much that as soon as i get back to home, I start playing this game till midnight and then I sleep. Ive doing that for like 5 months. The only good thing I was doing back then is focus with teachers and learn the maximum of information, I sit for tests that I have not revised for and I usually get between 10-13 because You know dakhel weni 7afedh 7ata 9a3da just fahem kol 7aja aala chnouwa ta7ki lmao.

Ok its the 1st of april now, 2 months before the bac exam, I didnt start studying right there because bac sport was too close and i fucking suck fl bac sport, I joined a gym, started doing nofap, trying my best and waking up early every morning to do pushups and so all, It was hell lmao, at the end i sit for that test and got 19.12. Thats literally the worst mark fel louled fel lycee. Idk why but I got depressed for a week, I felt like my tryharding for 2 weeks didnt benefit me at all, and ""lektef"" played a good role in this. Anyway, its the 27th(not sure tho) april now. Less than 2 months before the bac exam, we got like a week to revise for the bac blanc, I went to a public library, I studied there all the mornings and went to letudet fl 3chiet.

Relations between Lebanon and Tunisia are very close and the shared heritage is always mentioned at the official level.

Back to your question, yes, Tunisians are very aware of their history and proud of it, here for instance a plan to built a colossus of Hannibal in Carthage by Tunisia https://www.espacemanager.com/hannibal-va-enfin-retrouver-sa-terre-de-naissance.html

And more often than not it is the occasion to connect with the lebanese and many of such groups bring the 2 populations together.

evdhwvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/cjgbb6/,6,"That’s hell in a nutshell. We have enough regionalism within our country, no need for more local tensions. I think that everything would fall apart without cultural cohesiveness (just look at how Tunisians see Libya). Oh and good luck with appeasing tensions between Morocco and Algeria.

Again, pan-arabism days are over. Past experiences have just miserably failed. I would also refer to Bourguiba’s [answer](https://youtu.be/kEpF8ZEifUc) to Gaddafi on this matter.
We should think about this with pragmatism and avoid falling into logical fallacies around cultural and social belongingness. 

And all of this without even getting into economics (which will ultimately depend on the juridical status of the final entity). We might benefit from a EU-like MU on the trade balance, synergies and economies of scale levels, but we will likely suffer from an outflow of capital to Morocco given their investments’ grade and quality. I’m also not sure about each of the other countries’ econ policy and objectives atm, but it would be really difficult for us to achieve our regional goals as we are obviously underweighted, currency-wise, by comparison to the other members in case of a single currency zone due to our smaller capitalization. It will be hard to lobby for our interests (a high interest rate environment to curb inflation) especially if other members are divergent on this point. We will also lose tariffs (which represent a high percentage of gov income) from member states, simultaneously affecting Tunisian products, industries and employment negatively (Algerian and especially Moroccan products are quite known to have higher quality). 

Lots of issues to be addressed here IMO; we’re better off on our own. We should focus on developing our economy first and then think globally at a later stage.

I’m just throwing in random opinions and arguments here, but I’m sure that a more thorough discussion about this topic would be fruitful.",2019-07-29 22:17:31

I know it sucks as a consumer but we have to look at the big picture and not only on us. People crying about low employment, BIP and trade deficit. At the same time they consume american softdrinks, drive french cars, use korean smartphones with american software and communication controlled by a monopoly with scandals (e.g. Campridge analytica) every few months (facebook) but now one gives a fuck because we need to stare at it 4 hours a day. We go to italien and swiss hotels in our own country, companies i bet dont even pay their fair share and taxes. 
If we look back to the 1. Industrial revolution wich started in england. At that time germany, netherlands, france and the US were like the 3rd world compared to england. They didnt have an industrie yet. People worked as farmers or in manufacturies. And those countries didnt open their markets (like the IMF wants us to do today) because england had cheaper and better goods, in fact they did the opposite. Taxes were between 30 and 40 % until after WW2. Only when all developed an industrie they opened their markets to eachother. 
Same thing with china when they didnt let google and facebook and amazon in. I remember all ""economy experts"" crying about china missing the 4th industrial revolution. I dont have to tell u about huawei and alibaba today.... 
Dont get me wrong i dont think we should close our market north korean style but it makes sense to be very careful and smart and enter the economic chess game. 
Because they are proctecting their markets too. Like europe e.g. where 50% of EU budget goes to subsidies in farming, so thats nearly impossible for african farmers to enter their market in a sector where they can compete with them.
If you want a cheap PS4 then support the neoliberal politicians we have and support their speech (we have to open Tunisia for the world to develop)

f12mv52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/d7nnm8/,6,"#""omg am so sensitive i can't take any criticism about my holy religion :'( ""  

&amp;nbsp;

when will you understand that what is holy for you isn't holy for other and doesn't deserves any respect ? how the fuck do you want people to respect a cult that will oppress them whenever it will get a chance and even if it doesn't, your holy book indicate that non-believers will spend their after-life burning 24/7, why does your supposedly-existing god didn't respect us in the first place ?

&amp;nbsp;

people like you are the pure reason behind the backward mentality of the Islamic world, cunts who get offended when they see someone smoking a cigarette during Ramadan, or a couple kissing each other in the street, or some sarcastic magazine drawing a caricature about a man who died 1400 years ago.

You talk like we (""Islam-haters"" according to you) don't have any muslim friends or that we rejected or been rejected by our families, you're a fucken fool who doesn't use his brain and instead blindly follows the saudi arabian cult, your god (in islam) didn't ask you to defend him, in every story in the Quran god only asked prophets to advise people, even when they get super shitty and hurt innocent people (Lout people), god asked his prophet to walk away, and **GOD HIMSELF** dealt with them, not another human being, this is what your idiotic kind can't understand, you have absolutely no right to interpret a religion for me and make me live under the rules of **your own understanding** of it.

&amp;nbsp; 


I am **not** an atheist, well according to religious cunts like you, i must be an atheist cause i don't believe in what you believes in, but atheism in itself is a belief, and i don't believe that there is no god, it doesn't make sense, am sure that there is an origin or a source for this whole universe, but i also can't be 100% sure of the idea of personalizing it and making it ""human"", have you ever thought about that ? how your god ""likes"" and ""hates"" ? and ""reward"" and ""punish"" ? all of these are personification to a being that we have no fucking clue what it is, and then some human came up with a bunch of rules and force me to live by it, fuck that.

&amp;nbsp; 

Also, its pretty ironic when a crybaby like you come here protesting ""disrespect"" about his own religion, when all you do is [directly and personally attack people](https://i.imgur.com/quuJ0xB.png), its pretty funy that everytime some fuel-headed muslim pretend to defend Islam, end up being another entitled hypocrite who isn't even following the basic rules of Islam and any other religion in the world xD 

&amp;nbsp;

PS:

if your life is this shallow to the point of posting on reddit to bitch about reddit being reddit, then i can help you find a purpose for yourself, for example, if you are so inclined to defend Islam, how about you start protesting in front of the Saudi Arabian embassy to give Mekka &amp; medina back to every Muslim in the world instead of it being occupied by the most corrupt non-islamic government in the world ?

&amp;nbsp;

another-PS:

since am 100% sure that you wont even take the time to read this and come up with any decent argument and instead you're gonna personally attack me again, am gonna just say, Fuck **YOUR** Islam just for the lolz :D

That obviously didn’t work, with the results of the election coming in, i guess the head of the judges syndicate (who’s been the one holding meetings with Chahed before) changed his allegiance to the new rulers, and got the Karoui out in a record time (you can see Actuune, they posted the dates of the bureaucratic transactions, it’s like all of a sudden we have some Japanese employees doing work). The most hilarious thing was watching Karoui’s lawyer answer “who will Karoui hold accountable for this judicial abuse? Who’s mistake was this?” He simply said that this matter is political, he will not sue or pursue anything, which implies, Karoui is actually happy how our judiciary work, and he will benefit a lot from it in the next few years, he doesn’t wanna confront it at all, our judiciary is basically made for someone like Karoui.

I'm not okay with France doing what they did at all. I think we should gradually switch our second language from French to English, not only because it's 10 times more useful, but also because French is little more than just a trace of colonization.

The essential difference here my friend, and I think you're perfectily able to understand this, is that there is no reason to boycott France, unlike Israel.

We're boycotting Israel because we're taking part in an already well-established push for pressuring Israel into ending its settler colonial policies towards the Palestinians.

f8jph4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/e0v5eg/,6,"As an English teacher, I've noticed that Tunisian students are not yet ready to transition to learning such subjects in English. Even the more advanced students still struggle with understanding simple concepts and using relatively easy grammar structure. If they were to learn Maths and Science in English they're bound to find even more complex structures which would mean they'll be having a much harder time learning them. Therefore, the transition from using French to using English in schools needs to be well studied and built, which, I believe is what is being done right now as the Ministry of Education is engaged in a program called Teaching For Success Tunisia in collaboration with the British Embassy and the British Council. The aim of this program is to improve the quality of English language teaching in Tunisia and help English teachers deliver better lessons. Hopefully this will make things easier and we'll one day start using English instead of French in schools.",2019-11-24 13:42:28

On cherche à s'identifier à une culture qui nous est étrangère: amazigh, berbère, turque, Andalous (pour certain), phénicien, italien et même arabe. Notre culture n'est pas un mixte! notre culture est Tunisienne et le fruit d'une centaine de civilisations qui ont passé et évolué sur notre territoire:

*First* you make a map of youth hostels in Tunisia. Don't worry as there is a lot and a lot of Tunisian youth  into backpacking these days.

*Second* you make a map of the central train stations from Tunis to Gabés. They will simplify you life in getting where you need go, are comfier and safer than the bus, and are a nicer ride in general.

*Third* if you plan on exploring the Tunisian south, make sure to get inter-city bus schedules in advance. If you plan on going from Tunis straight to the South (Tataouine, Medenine, Zarzis/Djerba...) WITHOUT going through the middle, you can book a Train-bus ticket from Tunis for around 30 DT.

Keep to yourselves on the train. Don't wear purses. Don't stand close to doors or in empty wagons. Don't leave luggage alone. That's about it. 

If I had to advise good cities for backpacking in Tunisia this season:

- Djerba (A lot of excursions planned, Roman ruins, Roman-era sea bridge to the mainland)

- Kerkennah ( Beautiful Island, Low number of tourists, VERY authentic, accessible via ferry)

- Korbous (Small coastal village, amazing sights, Hot water spring coming out of sea cliff)

- Ichkeul national park (Nature and stuff, beautiful look at what North Africa used to look like) GET AUTHORIZATION FIRST

- Dougga ( Some of the most beautiful ancient ruins in the world PERIOD) GET AUTHORIZATION FIRST

- Cathage (Breath-taking necropolis of Carthago, straight out of Dark Souls) GET AUTHORIZATION FIRST

As for Tunisia and the eastern block neither Bourguiba nor the Tunisian ruling party would have agreed to join Moscow and its allies even if the US had used their right of veto.

In addition no western power would have accepted that Tunisia together with Algeria and Libya would constitute a unified front under Moscow’s influence. Since it would be a tangible threat to pro western African countries and a factor of uncertainty in the Middle East.

Just remember what happened in 1974 when a union was signed between Bourguiba and gaddafi. (Bourguiba decided to cancel it under direct pressions of his own wife and also his faithful prime minister).

So supposing that such an alternative was achievable not only the western block would have done every thing to make it fail, - specially since Hafez Al Assad would have planned to join- but Israel itself would have asked the US not to use their right of veto,

By the way I still remember what Kissinger once said on the Syrian former leader in comparison with his middle eastern peers. Speaking on the technics used in bilateral or multilateral negotiations to obtain a good offer from the US he said they all master this art, sometimes they even shout loudly that they are standing on a well’s edge and that their countries are going to fall into it if the US do not help them. 

Some of them will even stand on one foot only to put more pression on you. But none of them is like H. Al Assad who start any negotiations by throwing himself into that well and keeps cool until you finally accept to catch him before it is too late.",2019-06-17 17:51:08

evmjpis,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/ck6fub/,5,"Well I think this woman already has biases about how ""those countries"" are, so when she sees a situation that she does not understand those biases, even unconsciously, will affect her judgment.  A fight between a woman who happened to wear a headscarf and another one who happened not to wear one became a fight about the headscarf. She could not understand Arabic so she resorted to visual clues and their interpretation was influenced by her biases. Her only other clues where what she thought was an Allahu Akbar which she might have heard wrongly (like some arabs do not understand us so how would she know for sure that it was an Allahu Akbar and not something else) and even if it was Allahu Akbar, it could be said in a normal fight or even in a normal conversation without the intention of killing every infidel.

She, I assume, doesn't know Tunisian life neither because if she did she would have known that fights happen in the metro. Having to bare the filth, the heat (or cold if in the winter) and having all of those people so close to you is a breeding ground for discomfort that is added to an already existing sentiment of anger and stress caused by family and work issues, poverty... make up a recipe for a good fight (fights are not caused by a single thing but by a combination of past events and the ""cause"" of the fight is only ""la goute qui fait déborder le vase"").

What she said could also be right however quite unlikely given the language and culture barrier.

Tunisia is not a heaven on earth but is is not hell. Some crazy shit happens sometimes everywhere and there is ""headscrafisim"" although not as apparent and not really common: a recent example is the rouijel app (although in this case this sort of discrimination is quite crude). However this is both ways: I have a friend whom a teacher tried to convince her (more like force her) to ditch her scarf even though she liked it.

During their time in power, terrorists were given permits to hold rallies (Ansar al Sharia), islamists were allowed to recruit young people and send them to Syria, and the first Constitution they proposed in June 2013 was basically Sharia law (it's only after the July 2013 coup in Egypt and after immense foreign pressure  that they agreed to a new non-islamic constitution)

ewcd078,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/cnm2rg/,5,"It's a pretty simple recipe, just a little time consuming!

I usually get, in order of abundance:

* green peppers (some sweet, some spicy, depending on what you like!)
* tomatoes
* onions
* garlic

If you have a grill, I recommend using your grill, not super hot . Otherwise use the broil option in your oven.

Broil/grill your vegetables until they have a nice char on them, especially the peppers. And I mean, they need to be charred, not just slightly browned. I usually take the tomatoes off earlier than the rest cause I don't like mine too squishy.

When charred, and soft, remove all the vegetables, and put your peppers in a plastic bag and knot it up. Let them cool off. The steam stuck in the bag will help you with the next step. In the meantime, peel your tomatoes, onions and garlic (remove the char basically), and then chop them all up in a bowl.

Remove the peppers from the bag, peel them, remove the seeds, and then chop them up as well. Add all your veggies together in a  bowl.

At this point, you add whatever you like. My usual is:

* olive oil (the good tunisian stuff, if you can get it)
* Tabel (cumin/caraway powder)
* capers if you like
* salt to taste (don't under season!)
* decorate with tuna, boiled eggs.

I usually let it rest a bit at room temp for a couple of hours (or the fridge if longer).

About Turkish people, more than 25% of Tunisian people have Turkish blood, about Turkey, there isn't a one majority view but plenty of views with plenty of followers, they are mainly :

1- Turkey is a bad country who supports khwanjia and Daesh and ruled by a dictator, its past, the ottoman empire, were oppressors and invaded and destroyed our country

2- Turkey is a good country who supports Muslims all around the world and ruled by a caliph

3- Turkey is just a great destination for tourism and having good time, nothing more

These views are from my experience with lots of Tunisians, from teachers to friends to family members

Good luck learning Arabic, hopefully you will achieve it, as for visiting, honestly, summer is the best time for visiting because in the winter, things become bad especially the flood and when this happens, you won't find no where to go, no taxi, no bus, no train, no nothing and not even walking, the day will short so shops will close very very early and it would rare to see the sun and so the weather will  be always very very cold, so yeah it's best to come in summer or at least spring",2019-08-14 22:54:12

exb0r6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/crt35q/,5,"I hated it since Prep school. At that stage we started getting French teachers that had mocking students with bad French as their only job. This happened to me almost every year until I finished secondary school. Once we got an old female teacher , and during the class she used to ask us to do individual projects/presentations but she never actually teached us anything nor touched the learning manuals. Her excuse was 'the educational system is broken so I follow my own way in teaching you French'. I wish she tried to help us improve even for once, but instead she laughs hysterically at the 2 students that present their projects during every session, because they make mistakes. I should also mention her bitchy way of discussing our Tunisian culture. She basically starts hating on it and comparing it to French culture, saying that we are a ""retarded"" community and such, and that we should become like France. Then she starts praising France and literally acting like she's not even Tunisian, but rather a French citizen.

This was the worst of them, but the other ones were not much different. What they mostly had in common was their character and their blond-dyed hair. I used to like the language back in primary school, but because of the horrible experiences I've had with those teachers, I gradually hated this language alongside with France, the invader who is solely responsible for the emergence of such bootlickers.

Personally I think that the idea of eliminating French and replacing it with English is a very welcome idea. French should no longer be used by people to boast about their social status / tease other people or simply show off.",2019-08-18 09:23:14

Point being the region had long lost its identity to foreign influences by the time the Arabs came. So no need to bring that up again as if the French indoctrination is ok because the Arabs did the same.

But the reality of the matter is that French is a tool in the hand of the French government. It is only useful to us as long as whatever we gain can benefit France. Study medicine in French? Free doctors for France. sciences? engineering? A pool from which France can and does take the best of the best at its leisure. La Francophonie is a formidable geopolitical tool that [benefits only the French](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7Kph52MfRo). English on the other hand doesn't have this kind of secret use.

And if the only thing that French has to offer is that it is beautiful, then you can use all the Arabic you want for your poetry.

Now to the complex towards France. It's no complex towards France when I see the language being pushed by the French government. It is no complex when France actively keeps interfering in the internal politics of Tunisia. However, there is a certain complex when saying we somehow are not mature enough without France.

Today, most Tunisians would tell you, we respect Jews but they say that because it's politically correct. And because the government of Tunisia want to push this idea to the world.

I, as a Tunisian never met a Tunisians jew and don't know how he feels in Tunisia but between Tunisians, there is some kind of sinister grudge or resentment against them. They use the word ""jew"" as a slur. Many Tunisians still don't make a difference between a jew and Zionist.  There are extra security in Jewish Holy site. Look for yourself. That extra security is not for nothing.

All in all, Tunisians are racist in disguise. Remember this.

The truth is hard to get because no one would tell you I hate Jews, they get too much hate for it. It can only be tested if a crisis occurs that involve Jews.

f0hu8h3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/d4up29/,5,"He's the textbook definition of populism

&gt;A common framework for interpreting populism is known as the ideational approach: this defines populism as an ideology which presents ""the people"" as a morally good force and contrasts them against ""the elite"", who are portrayed as corrupt and self-serving. Populists differ in how ""the people"" are defined, but it can be based along class, ethnic, or national lines. Populists typically present ""the elite"" as comprising the political, economic, cultural, and media establishment, depicted as a homogeneous entity and accused of placing their own interests, and often the interests of other groups—such as large corporations, foreign countries, or immigrants—above the interests of ""the people"". Populist parties and social movements are often led by charismatic or dominant figures who present themselves as the ""voice of the people"".

So apparently our parliament is bad because it doesn't represent our people but Kais totally does painting himself as ""the voice of people"" against parties etc

And apparently Tunisians have no problems with corruptions so if you just brought the power closer to them everything would be fine (it's not, his proposed """"""""program"""""" is a corruption shitfest), and we're all straight but Big Bad Foreign countries want to make us gay (WTF??), oh and terrorism is totally from foreign countries, his Hizb Al Tahrir friend is totally cool though.

Oh and we can't have organisations working, wouldn't want things to improve do we?

2- for thinking that Kais is an anarchist. He's a constitutional professor, I'll let you google that. He's someone different, with different ideas and visions for how politics should be done. I'd rather call him a visionary crazy person with crazy ideas brought from the history (door to door politics and let the people make the big decisions via referendums).
3- for thinking that the president with the current constitution and prerogatives could make the economy better. One the economy won't get better coz it's the chief of government job and not the president, two coz no one proposed a solid long term plan to fix it.
4- for thinking that Karoui is better at anything. Being the CEO of companies which their only purpose is money laundering doesn't qualify to be any good economically speaking

I found a couple of good advices that i want to share :
- instead of following the mass, try to dig into the information and make your own opinion. Any sane human being would never go to the circus they call ""Elhiwar"". If you wanna know the man, internet is full of his old interviews starting with Gilbert Nakkach and on and on.
""False opinions are like false money, struck first of all by guilty men and thereafter circulated by honest people who perpetuate the crime without knowing what they are doing""
- Don't be surprised by the result, it's been the pools result for almost 6 months but we wanted to believe we're something else. We're an illiterate corrupt nation, and as a wise man said : ""Every nation gets the government it deserves.""",2019-09-19 10:42:03

&amp;nbsp;

Why ?

&amp;nbsp;

Cause am a service-seller (programmer) not a product-seller (ex: dropshipping), i don't deal with ""customers"", i work with clients who will never use Paypal for anything higher than $2000, at that level companies all over the world will almost exclusively chose to work with bank-to-bank transitions, because: 

1. it's cheaper than paypal  

2. more secure

3. taxes

&amp;nbsp;

Now with that said, i believe that international money transfer should be the right of every citizen, and it should be the duty of the government to make that happens, we can implement plenty of systems that can make that work just like Banks do, which i assume most of you never heard of, private Tunisian Banks will give you an international bank account with a credit card that you can use anywhere, of course you still can't make a paypal account to receive money on it cause our country is not supported **by them**, but you can still spend your money internationally, but don't expect that you can go to the bank tomorrow and tell them to make you a € account, you need to prove that you have a steady business that is bringing € first, surely you don't expect our millionnaires to be only able to spend dt6000 **per year** when they go on a trip xD 

&gt;(the 6k per year is the quota determined by the government for the average citizens touristic trip, like wtf am i gonna do with just 6k **PER YEAR**, that doesn't even cover hotel costs lol)

&amp;nbsp;

So yeah, the situation is not as smooth as it's in the USA or Europe, but we are not living the USA nor in Europe, there are plenty of good reasons (that i agree with) when it comes to not letting your average ""frère"" have access to paypal, i would never agree that my earned money in € will be spent by a couple of ugly cunts on their retarded football betting websites. 

&amp;nbsp;

But i also know that we need solutions, specially for young people who are still a bit ""foolish"" about freelancing and overall money making online, no offense but it seems to me that most of the young people who are bitching about paypal are just making excuses for their incompetence, i keep hearing shit like ""if we had paypal, i'd be making $1000/month"", yeah ? , how ?

&amp;nbsp;

#Graphic design:

I am the lead developer and art director of an Australian game company, and believe me, i would KILL for a Tunisian graphic artists, but i can't even get anyone with a decent portfolio (here is an example of the people we worked with: [Artist 1](https://dribbble.com/rkrishnamani), [Artist 2](https://dribbble.com/linmuxi), [Artist 3](https://dribbble.com/oleglega), [Artist 4](https://dribbble.com/miguelgarest))  

So no, i hate to break it to you, but knowing how to copy 4 logos after watching 3 tutorials on youtube, wont make you $1k/month

#Programming:

Am a CS student (dropped out from college, 2nd year) and i have friends who are **paying** to get a bullshit engineering degree from ""ESPغit"" just so they can make ~2500tnd/month after 5 years of study with the hope of fleeing the country, if that's how a programming engineer think, then am happy that they don't have access to our foreign currency reserve :)

#Translation, blogging, (lettre stuff) etc.. :

There is a market for sure, but its **HIGHLY** competitive.


#Stock market

All of a sudden everyone thinks they are the next Bobby Axelrod, and beside, all you need to join this is a proper business in your country (Batinda) and you can join eToro and show us how you will become a millionnaire in one year lol

#Dropshipping

yeah, without paypal you're fucked because you're dealing with ""day-to-day"" customers, still there are ways around this, and i know few people who found a solution.

----------------------------------------------------


&amp;nbsp;


Now, here is your surpise of the day, **NONE** of these fields require paypal, you can just join a freelancing platform, get a couple of jobs, keep your money in the platform, and once it reaches a good amount, you can either look for an alternative payment method (payoneer, skrill, worldremit, etc...) or ask the platforms to wire it for you to your bank, of course if its a big amount of money, then the government will ask you how the fuck did you get it, and for that, you need to start a proper company (batinda) so you can pay your taxes properly, but of course, none of us ""chabéb"" wanna go into that hustle, now i admit, our administrative service is **THE WORST**, but hey, if you are making that $1k/month, you can just hire a lawyer and let him do everything for you (that's what i did)


&amp;nbsp;

aaaanyway...

My point is : 

#Stop bitching and find a solution for your own problems. 

not talking directly to you OP, its a message to everyone who love to sit on their asses and blame the government, we are not Sweden, but am sure as hell that we are not fucking Iraq or Libya or some clusterfucked country in Africa or Asia, if you have a computer and an Internet that made you think about the necessity of Paypal, then you are not poor/miserable like the unlucky ones who doesn't even have water system in their houses, it means you are living a good life, under a good house with proper 21st century ""luxuries"", so stop bitching and start working, and if you believe that the mix of idiots/corrupt people that we have in our governments (old and new) are gonna fix your problems, then your life will never improves.

You may have trouble getting a hotel room if you are not married, try AirBnB, even there some houses will say “married couples only” but others don’t care especially if you are both foreign. Messaging with your host should give you an indication whether they are nosy or whether they are more “don’t ask, don’t tell”. 

I only have experience flying into Tunis and you can definitely change your money at the airport there. 600d spending money for yourself for a week should be doable but it depends how much sightseeing and eating out you plan to do and how luxe.

In terms of safety follow local news for a bit and see how you feel. It depends on what you are used to. Of course compared to Europe it’s less safe but using common sense and not going round completely ignorant of local customs you should be fine. Especially in a resort town like Sousse. But for what it’s worth I have never felt unsafe during my travels. Tunisian people are wonderful and the country is truly beautiful.

f6osd1x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/dry5r3/,5,"[Here’s a link to the original write up of the survey results. The results are from 2012](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2012/07/10/chapter-4-gender-equality/). 

This is from Pew. The Pew Research Center is one of the largest think tanks in America, and definitely the largest that doesn’t take any policy positions. They do a lot of high quality polling, both in the US and abroad. They are among the most relied on by social scientists. After a year or two, they generally release the survey data so that researchers can run their own regressions, etc. (Pew almost never runs regressions;they almost always just do cross-tabs like the one pictured.) In general, the only survey data that is seen as more reliable than Pew is data that specifically collected for social science, for example, the Genera Social Survey or the American National Election Survey in America, Eurobarometer in Europe, Arabarometer in the Arab World, etc. 

They use reliable methodology, getting as random a sample as possible and then demographically weighting it according to census results (where census results are seen as accurate which is most countries). So representative of the population of the country 18 and older. Sometimes this is the “non-institutionalized” population of the country, so it doesn’t include those in jail or the army, but I think Pew in general tries to get the whole population (that difference tends to have only small effects in sub-populations that are disproportionately institutionalized *and* where the institutionalization affects one part of the sub population more than others—for example, African-Americans in the US, where a *lot* of African Americans are in jail and those in jail tend to have less education than African-Americans not in jail; even then, it only changes results by a few percentage points). In the US and Europe, most of their surveys are conducted by phone, but I know in Turkey, for example, the  surveys are carried out face-to-face as well because of worries that a telephone sample would be biased towards the educated. *Edit: I checked, these were all done face-to-face. In all of these countries, the sample size was 1,000 adults except Turkey where the sample size was 1,001 and Pakistan’s which had 1,206 respondents. Those are fairly large sample sizes. Margin of error depends on total population, ranging from +/-3.9% in Tunisia to +/-5.2% in Turkey. All are representative of the country’s adult population, except for Egypt which is representative of the total adult populations except for those living in the Frontier governorates, which make up about 2% of the population. The Lebanon sample also excludes a few small areas of Beirut and on the border with Israel that are militia controlled but they tried to weight to make up for it, I believe. Pakistan was a bigger problem and survey was not done in several regions where fighting was happening so only reflects 82% of the country basically not living along the Afghan frontier or in Kashmir or the dangerous parts of Baluchistan*. The full methodology is always available on their website. 

As for the question wording, that’s also available online. In general, I’ve found the Pew question wording is very good and as neutral as possible. With some of these international surveys, there’s been some issue with translating very specific concepts, but I don’t think that would be an issue with a question like this. I’ve never found the Pew questions to be misleading, and again one nice thing is you can always go check. 

As for what equal rights means, it means whatever the survey respondents think it means. Pew won’t define it. So in Turkey, for instance, some proportion of people who support “equal rights” might also support a daughter being on her father’s insurance after they’re 18 until they’re married (this is the current Turkish law and it doesn’t apply to adult sons). If the respondent doesn’t see a contradiction, neither will the survey results.

 We ARE in fact pretty much culturally Arab, not to say that Tunisia doesn't have its own national and regional culture, linguistically it's a bit iffy because a Saudi Arab could barely understand Derja and there has been discussion of the Maghrebi dialect becoming its own fully fledged language, just as Maltese is no longer classed as a form of Arabic. But for sure, the culture of Tunisia, especially in urban areas is a mixture of Arab, lots of French culture (think 9ahwa, kiss kiss, allou, traditionally secular) What's more, Somalia, Djibouti, Mauritania are all in the Arab League yet the majority of these people's are not Semitic, so the whole notion of being Arab is very blurred, and even then, Arabs have adopted aspects of Berber culture, and vice versa, both speak Afro-Asiatic languages, both are predominantly Muslim (this gets different when you consider Tunisia and Africa in general is largely Maliki, whilst the ME proper is largely Hanafi with a huge array of other sects and schools of thought) 

Most academic articles you will find tend to lean in the direction that Tunisia and the Maghreb in general is a region of Arabised Berbers, with Turkish, Arab, European and African influence. I agree that most Tunisians identify as Arab but I believe this is the result of the Berber identity being purged by French colonialists and more recently, Pan-Arab Tunisian leaders, I have some qualms about your comment stating Tunisia is one of the most homogenous nations in the Greater Middle East, simply because you'll find some sources say 80% of Tunisia is Berber, then the next will say up to 20% are Turkic, with another saying it's 99% Arab, the stats are just..meh and I think people get race, culture, language, ethnicity etc mixed up. With all that said you could be right, this is simply what I've concluded for myself but I'm always keen to learn more about my heritage. 

This is just my opinion, I'm not preaching that we are one or the other, I think the beauty of our people is in our diversity. Because at the end of the day, seldom does someone in Tunisia care whether you identify as Berber, Arab, African or Turkish, you're still Tounsi.",2019-12-02 00:45:56

the most expensive custom fee was for an iphone (50dt +10dt cert) but the iPhone was sent as a personal package (gift) you can easily find sellers who do that, as for other things its usually between free to 20dt all paid in the post office.

examples (all of these products are shipped normally, not a ""gift"" and bought from ebay) :

earphones: 5d

tons of Korean food (30kg, rapid post): 20dt

Kurzgesagt limited 12019 calendar (bought from their partner website ): free and it arrived to my home.

books: 1.5dt

------

arrival time:

standard shipping: usually between 1 and 2 months.

expeditted shipping: nothing more than 10 days but its very expensive (up to $90 + 20dt to rapid post)

ps: 

avoid ""raw"" electronics material (components, arduino, etc...) and even phones, these need to pass some tests (http://www.cert.tn) if its a mainstream product it will pass but if it's a component to build different things you'll end up bein interrogated (never happened to me, but i know a friend who went through that over an arduino board) 



hope that helps.

ek4r45k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/b9fxb4/,4,"Another piece of advice is about eating in their houses. Be really careful about that. I don't eat in random people's houses. Or I only accept fruit and such. I have gotten sick several times when given leftovers.

Almost every family over there has a cultural habit of eating from the same communal dish. Everybody is digging to it with their spoon or fork or bread or fingers. Then the dish is covered up and often just left sitting out overnight until somebody finishes it off.

When you go to somebody's house, they feel compelled to offer you something to eat if you stay long enough. If they don't have something fresh, they will give you these leftovers.

As you can well imagine, because you are not part of their family, you don't share all the strains of bacteria and viruses and whatever else they are carrying. So you are likely to get sick when you partake of their leftovers that every person in that house has stuck their saliva covered spoon into.

Also, when somebody in the household is sick with the ""gripp"" or whatever, that person still eats out of the family's communal dish. One time, everybody sat down to eat and somebody in the family was sick. I said, woaw, she seems sick. They were like it is just allergies. I was like, it doesn't look like allergies. She looks sick and I'm not eating. They made fun of me. (We have a close relationship me and that entire family. They are like my family really so they give me shit and I give them shit. I really like them so much.) So anyway, I didn't eat and they thought I was being so stupid. 

Guess what happened? Like half of them got sick. And then one of them told me, you know, I was making fun of you for not eating with us when so and so was sick but guess what, most of us got sick from her. I was like, of course you did. It is basic medical science that you can't share utensils or a communal dish with somebody who is sick!

So if you are going to be staying with one specific family and none of them is sick, then go ahead and eat the way they do otherwise they will be angry with you probably. Then you will just get sick once from them and then have immunity after that. You can spend a couple weeks sick maybe and afterwards be protected. But with any other people, just claim that you are not hungry. Don't tell them you are refusing food because somebody is sick or you don't eat leftovers that everybody has had their spoon in. Just say you are not hungry. Or else you will offend people.

And who would those be?

Our economic dependency on France is due to our assimilation of the French language instead of the more widely used lingua franca which is English. We did not choose to impose French on our children and their education because we seek to improve our economic ties with France in particular, rather we're doing it because we don't have any other choice.. France continues to impose this status of satellite state on its former colonies via the Francophonie organisation, as well as with direct military intervention and political meddling in internal affairs of these countries.

Furthermore, having a single important trading partner is a very bad thing, and should not be encouraged by making the labour force unable to deal with any other partners besides it.

I will listen to these calls to continue making us beholden to the French language if France involves itself in a similar way to the countries it influences into using French. Meaning they must accept to tie their prosperity with ours. Otherwise, it'll remain a win-lose relationship at our expense, and we should stop making decisions that are going to affect future generations.",2019-04-05 21:40:12

Also, in the ""rue de la Kasba"" there's a good place that sella kafteji and other Tunisian plates you should try it, I forgot the name of the place tho, and right next to it there's a place that makes a Sandwich called Chapati in the Mahdese way.
Also, there's a place called ""Oueld El Hadj"" in ""Bed Jedid"", the way of the Kasbah.
For a fancier experience, there's an excellent place called ""Dar BelHadj"", it's close to the Zaytouna's mosque, you can find it in maps; it offers many Tunisian plates in a fancy building with traditional architecture, a real gem you should try.



Also, in Tunis Downtown, although not Tunisian plate, but an extremely delicious one, in ""rue de Marseilles"" there's a small place called ""chicken house"" it makes Shawarma in indian bread, one of the best things you can try in Tunis.
And never forget to try ""Mlewi and Mtabga"" you find these everywhere in the Medina (I know some places)


And of course the fricassée (I know a great place, a little further of the medina, but the best in my opinion, I can help you in getting them)
And in ""Beb el Jazira"" there's a place my friend knows that makes the best Tunisian pasta ever, I will ask him for the location.


And in an alley next to ""Rue Jemaa Zaytouna"" there is a couple of tunisian sweets makers, one of the best things you'll ever try.
And never forget to try some Cafés in the Médina (like Panorama, Café Vert, Café Souk, Little sarrajine, el enba)


And I have some friends from Sousse, I will ask them about good places there.

Pour ce qui concerne les drones bah c'est normal, vu que la Tunisie est un champs libre de tout les services de renseignement étranger il faut contrôler au moins les moyens qu'ils utilisent, en particulier les drones. C'est pas uniquement le cas de la Tunisie. Des pays ""développés"" interdissent aussi l'usage des drones ou au moins ils ont une politique stricte de leurs usages: interdiction sur les lieux publiques, restriction sur certains type de drones, etc... vu l'impact sur la vie privée des personnes.

Pour le covoiturage c'est pas une question d'interdiction ou pas, il faut mettre en place les moyens pour le contrôler (question sécurité, impôt, impact sur le business des taxis, etc...) et du coups les moyens derrière (institutions, procédures, agents de contrôle etc...) et pour cela il faut aussi du budget. On essaye de trouver des moyens alternatives (par exemple taxi jama3i w machabah).

Wow you worded your second point perfectly so it looks like Tunisia is against jews and their right to live here
1. The tunisian constitution doesn't forbid jews specifically to run for president it also forbids anyone who is not muslim. So it's not against jews explicitly as you imply. (But I do disagree with this rule, I'd rather have a righteous non-muslim ruler than a corrupt muslim one)
2.I'm pretty sure every tunisian citizen is allowed  in the military and even if someone didn't even do his military service, it doesn't mean he shouldn't live in Tunisia, that's definitely not the meaning behind the verse..

elz2gtd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/bhzfqk/,4,"Alright here are the official prices if you buy from a legit tobacconist.

Camels: 5TND400, available as whites, blues and Yellows.

Royale 5TND available as lights, normal 100s, and menthol 100s

Monte Carlo 4tnd500 IIRC,  available as blue and grey, 100s and King Size.

Marlboros are the most expensive, available as lights, reds and touch.

There are plenty of other brands(Merit, 20 Mars, Cristal) and also local ones but I've just included the ones you may be interested in.

Now for the flavoured fancy stuff. 

You can get Dunhill Switch in most areas, available as blue , green or Gray. Which are menthol, some other weird menthol, and chewing gum taste.

I've never come across double click cigarettes, however here's a piece of advice where to look for them:  Rich neighborhood's tobacconists. Some of them sell duty free cigarettes, so their shipments may differ once in a while and can be moist. Just look for areas where there could be foreigners or well off persons. (La Marsa, Downtown Tunis, El Menzah, Ennasr, etc..)

A few tips: 

As the other redditor mentioned, a legit cigarette pack is one with a blue sticker at the back if it's not a locally made cigarette. There are only 3 locally made brands (Saphyr, Cristal and 20 Mars).

Some knock off illegal cigarettes do have blueberry/lemon/chocolate/Chinese garbage flavours to them, you'll find them at non legit stalls almost everywhere nowadays.

Prices for the same pack may vary from a legit tobacconist to one without a license, the legit tobacconist will charge you less. It doesn't matter how fancy a shop may look, it may not operate with a license to sell tobacco.

Be aware that if you're shopping at touristic areas you'll be charged more than usual. (I once was asked for 7tnd500 for pack of Camels at Mahdia, while their price was 5tnd at the time )",2019-04-28 11:04:45

epwjh8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/bw61bw/,4,"Originally from a Northwestern small town, in the first of the four years I spent in the capital Tunis studying I tried to avoid contacting strangers, especially foreigners, as much as I could. It wasn't xenophobia, it was just because I didn't enjoy meeting new people, especially the ones with whom I would find a difficulty communicating because of the cultural barrier. So it wasn't a choice for me, but I met Americans and Brits and Russians and Canadians, and I also met Libyans. Now the way you'd see a Libyan talk or act in general is not what you'd call elegant or smart or cool. They drive expensive cars but can act in a very uncivilized manner, days ago I was at the gaz station and a Libyan stopped his car, walked out and made and angry call, screaming like a goat, leaving everyone complaining. But here's what I think, I don't think Tunisians are much better, we just tend to forgive our countrymen more easily, and not forget the mistakes of aliens. 
 However, all the Libyans that I met, befriended and actually spoke to were great people, smart and educated, which was a bit shocking to me as I've only heard of Libyans as dumb and close minded. So yeah, we might have our differences, but Libyans and Tunisians aren't that different. Tunisians got a better education and are less religious and more open minded, but the gap is shrinking and only communication can prove that we're very similar people.",2019-06-03 15:56:25

eqrambo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/bw61bw/,4,"Libyan here. I've never really lived in Libya but I've visited quite a few times. I've also visited 9 Arab countries including Morocco and Tunisia. 

First, I'll start with your claim and try to give my anecdotal assessment.  The Libyans I have met in the west are generally quite civil people regardless of financial status. Obviously there are quirks just like any other subculture, but I wouldn't say they were obvious to an outside observer. 

The Libyans I've met in Libya on the other hand, including some of my extended family members are definitely a different breed. I think one contributing factor is education. Even in relation to other Arab countries that have less wealth, Libya is pretty abysmal. The culture is pretty toxic. And another huge influence is lack of exposure to the outside world. Up until the 90s, we were pretty much a communist state. Xenophobia is rampant.

But in saying all that, one thing I think you should definitely take on board is the fact that the Libyans that frequent Tunisia really are the lowest level of society. They are wealthy people that want a chance to flaunt their money in a country they consider a nearby Vegas. Libya has extremely strict cultural norms, strict drug, alcohol and sex laws (maybe less of a reason since the arab spring) so Tunisia is a haven for these people, especially since it's one of the few places a Libyan passport can get you into.

Judging Libyans based on those that frequent Tunisia is like judging Saudis by those that frequent Monaco. 

So in summary, my 2 cents are that I'd rank Libyan culture as one of the least pleasant of arab cultures in general, but I think your perception is probably heavily skewed if you're judging based on the ones you see in Tunis",2019-06-11 12:13:27

&amp;nbsp; 

&gt; how you can become an organ donor. I read that Tunisia operates presumed consent legislation, so you have to opt-out if you don't want to donate your organs.


according to the article it works like this, 

&amp;nbsp;

There is what they call an ""Objection book"", a person need to ""sign up"" there because that is the first place a hospital will look at, if the name of the deceased is there, then they wont use his organs. 

&amp;nbsp; 

If his name is not there, they will look at his national ID, because thanks to the 2004 law, a citizen can ""manually"" add the ""Donor"" status to his ID, if the citizen has that, then the hospital will use his organs. 
 
&amp;nbsp; 

And finally if the deceased name isn't in the objection book, but he also doesn't have the donor status in his ID, the hospital will ask the family and its up to them to accept or refuse.


&amp;nbsp; 

The article also states that when it comes to asking the family ~85~90% of them end up refusing the donation.


&amp;nbsp; 

There is plenty of other useful informations in the article, try finding someone who will help you with the translation, there is also [another article](http://archive.alchourouk.com/224694/567/1/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%91%D8%B9-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B9%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%86%D8%B3-:10000-%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%86%D8%B3%D9%8A-%D9%81%D9%82%D8%B7-%D9%8A%D8%AD%D9%85%D9%84%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%A9-%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%91%D8%B9-...--) (same journal) that states that only ~10000 Tunisians have the donor status in their ID.

You wouldnt want your parents to be alone. You would want them to be surrounded by people they know in case they need anything.
They have been away for years so they will find a different country than the one they left.

They should rent close to family members. 
Accommodation and food are cheaper outside the capital and people are friendlier and more helpful.
So the 1000$ should be enough outside the capital,for now. 
Five more years and it won't be enough because everything is getting more and more expensive

Also you wouldn't want your parents to go to public hospitals.
The government will cover medication for chronic diseases (if they need any) which is very helpful. But other than that you need to go to private practices and private hospitals (clinique) and they are expensive.

ewu98lx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/cpuj9k/,4,"I had a very pleasant experience with el bac. I passed it on 2016 with an average of 17.25. My mistake that year was that I overworked. Sincerly! I could've got 18 or more if I gave myself a break. I was used to go back home from school and start studying at 7pm until 1am. I did this from October to April and everyday except for Saturday where I would chill and watch a movie. I regret not doing sport and sitting too much on the chair. So my advice for those who will sit for it, study and study hard. But don't get exhausted.  Focus on the main subjects but don't neglect languages. You should divide your time wisely. For example, study the main subjects all week, but on the weekend do something light : language or a secondary subject. I also advice you to rest. Get 7 hours of sleep per night. Exercise. Go and do something fun once every 2-3 weeks. Help your friends and don't keep any knowledge to your self.  Be up-to date, it's good for your knowledge and your psychology as having so much to do will get you frustrated and bored. That's all I can think about for now. And remember passing bac is quite possible for average students, so don't be terrified!",2019-08-14 08:11:58

It takes guts to use them in real life not like you see in movies and video games. If a mishaps occurs, the mugging can turn very south and the mugger may retaliate with more violence. 

You can't avoid mugging all together, that's the risk you run by using public transportations.
Use your common sence. 
Keep an eye on your surrounding. Check if you're followed.  Avoid using phone in public. Keep your bag on the sheltered side of the road since most mugging happens with motorcycles. Keep away from doors in trains. And for girls, just walk in groups not alone. This is like the oldest trick in book.

 Alternatively, you can minimize chances of such occurrence by trying to find some classmates that can get you closer to your home if they have cars. Co voiturage is another solution if you can afford it.

You are confusing dialects and languages my dear. What you did list is a subgroup of the [Italic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italic_languages) within the [Indo-European language family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages). Get your facts strait. I speak fluent french, but that does not mean I can understand belgians when they speak french.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;there's a paper online which i will try to find that lists every tunisian word of amazigh origin and there are A LOT!

Doesn't prove anything, since a culture is a mixture. and does not serve as an argument to scream, quote:

&gt;TUNISIANS ARE IMAZIGHEN!!

And therefore forget the major influence of arabs in tunisian culture.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Same morals...? Looool I barely know any tunisians that pray, most tunisians I know drink and have sex before marriage, if you think North Africans and Middle Eastern arabs have the same morals you've been living under a rock my friend.

Are you talking about religion ? I am confused. You are confusing (again) moral and religion my dear:  **Morality** (from [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language): *moralis*, [lit.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literal_translation) 'manner, character, proper behavior') is the differentiation of [intentions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intention), decisions and [actions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_actions) between those that are distinguished as proper and those that are improper.

Even if I want to follow your logic, the fact that you are doing it, doesnt mean it's not considered wrong by **your** society.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;we are not genetically arab

I am not even going to ask you for proof, since you can't even define ethnicity and you dont know how to distinguish culture, genetical heritage and ethnicity. I invite you to read this research article if you want to explore North African genetic heritage:  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5084816/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5084816/)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;black tunisians are ethnically different to Amazigh tunisians that's a fact it's not racism,

You need to be more openminded than you think I am. Skin color is a thing, ethnicity is another. Again I invite you to read the referenced article above.

&amp;#x200B;

Last, I am sorry to disappoint you, but you didn't ""educate"" me and gave me 0 new knwoledge (I wish you did though).

You are giving **0 relevant/scientific arguments**. You just gave **judgments** (on how I think mostly) and gave the same **narrow and bias analysis**  based on clichés and **prejudices**.

Kais ran on being against the system of parties, saying that they are obsolete, also he had a very low cost campaign so that won him points.

f3pydkj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/dhra98/,4,"&gt;About the 4th point: Tunisia will never and should never establish ties with Israel. 

France and Germany used to say the same thing. 500000 people were killed and they signed peace. 

I'm not advocating establishing direct relationship with Israel but if Israeli tourists want to visit, there is nothing wrong with that.

&gt;personally don't believe we should gratify presidents or leaders any more than what their actions show us.

Singapore leaders are the most highly paid in the world. The idea is that no one will lead a nation for a ridiculous wage that is lower than the private sector. This opens the door to corruption. By paying leaders well, they can ensure their independance vis a vis the private sector. 

https://www.gov.sg/~/sgpcmedia/media_releases/pmo-psd/press_release/P-20180301-1/attachment/Annex%20B%202017%20Review%20Committee%20Report.pdf

Leaders have highly sensitive state secrets. They are looked after by hostile foreign powers and foreign corporations. This is why this system of taking care of former leaders exist in countries like The United States. China is extreme and bans former leaders from leaving the country.

&gt;I don't understand the point of 9 and 6 ( decreasing the number of seats, the salary is understandable ).

Point 9 means that every year, for 1 week-end, The Tunisian Presidential Palace and the Tunisian Parliament will be open for all Tunisian citizens to visit. Because it belongs to them.  It's a democracy event. The same event is organized every year in European countries where people can visit their Palaces.

This  proves us  who is really Kais Said.
* We don't need a program in order to elect a leader , but you do need one in order to elect a common man. a leader is a man with commitment , not a man with empty promises. And the first commitment is his loyalty to the cause, The palestinian cause.

And yes you have to study that stuff, something you don't like doesnt mean it's not important, most of us hates them but you have to, it's knowledge , it can change your mind set 

As for the languages,we did talk about it here many times, and it's fucking important to study french as any other language, well English is dead too by the way, and it's overrated realy, you use English just to make memes watch TV shows and play some games, if you are thinking about jobs go learn some Korean or Chinese or German or even Portuguese.

Let me remind you that the majority of Tunisians have amazigh blood and the Tunisian culture is heavily influenced by Amazigh culture or even is an Amazigh culture, our famous dish, the couscous, is of amazigh origin, Tunisia is named after old amazigh village, Tunisian Arabic dialect has plenty of amazigh loanwords, our traditional clothes is also of amazigh and so on....
Amazigh people aren't just bunch of barbarians, in fact, no ethnic group is a barbarian, that term was mostly used against others as an insult, not an accurate description, so amazighs had a big mark on world history and built empires and states and there were even roman emperors from amazigh origin
Now back to Tunisia, there are still plenty of Tunisians who identify as amazighs and most of them have amazigh language as their native tongue and it's really unfair to force them completely abandon it and adopt a language that is far different from their native language and on top of that they need to learn another two completely different language so they can be successful in their life, destroying a native culture is a crime, even if you don't see it that way, it is a natural right for a person to speak his native language and practice his traditions, so it's not about going back to our old roots but rather being fair to every group and treating everyone equally",2019-11-03 18:17:19

Also, I am pretty sure ""real"" muslims who are truly faithful and convinced with their own religion will not suddenly leave it overnight because they befriended someone or because they received money or else. Unless they have never really been very convinced with islam in first place, and they've found something they feel better and more suitable to them.. People are totally entitled to make decisions they find will benefit them, as long as they're not really hurting anyone. It's a private matter.

He would specify why that decision was taken. It wasn’t by an order from the president, he had no opinion on the matter. Ministers were just given suggestions from other countries or mimicking other governments. There was no profound studies. My point is, well what I came to realize, it really is bigger than Bourguiba. I know it’s always easier to pint at someone and say “it’s him who’s driving”, I know he’s the tip of the spear, it’s like a soccer team, “just fire the coach”, but there’s layers to it, and laziness and stubbornness definitely played a big role for us to land in the situation we’re in.",2019-11-29 16:21:24

f9es4tx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/e4ko7q/,4,"I absolutely agree with your point. One of the beautiful things about Tunisia, and the Arab world in general, is its diversity. What people identify with isn't an issue, as long as there is respect for the country's diversity. 

There are a couple of things in your text that I want to question though, also because I find them to be interesting matters of conversation.

&gt;I believe this is the result of the Berber identity being purged by French colonialists

Didn't the French actually favour Berbers though? Seeing in them, an ancient, once upon a time Christian people who were overrun by Muslim Arabs. This is what I at least have read in some articles, along with the claim that anti-Berber policies in post-colonial Algeria were sometimes backed with this argument. 

I've always been very interested as to when Arab identity became the dominant in the country. I also thought it became so after colony times with Pan-Arabism and all (at which time it was undoubtedly strengthened). Until my father claimed that the French archives of pre-colonial Algeria (which is close enough to Tunisia in this context), have an overview of the ethnicity of the tribes in the region (presumably on the basis of self-identification) which are available online, and that he saw that many of the tribes in Eastern Algeria (including my family which is originally from Algeria) were Arab. I have never personally checked on the claim, however. 

&gt;Most academic articles you will find tend to lean in the direction that Tunisia and the Maghreb in general is a region of Arabised Berbers

Are you sure they use the term Arabised Berbers? My claim of 99% being ""Arab-Berber"" was from an academically cited claim on Wikipedia. The term ""Arabised"" is kind of weird so I'd be suprised if that's the most used term in academia, and not ""Arab-Berber"" which is what I've seen the most in academic contexts.",2019-12-02 01:28:44

Thirdly, keep the current flow of loans from the FMI, because cutting them or proposing any other solution might mess with my first and ultimate goal, re-election.

Maybe it seems tempting to eat it directly as you have it in tube form , but here in tunisia we mostly have it in can form and we rarely eat it alone , if you are not combining it with one of the above or with your meal , you should make a harissa sandwich and its still as hot .

For traditional jewelry and clothes you can visit [www.elkhomssa.shop](https://www.elkhomssa.shop) and visit the Medina (not alone, or else you will get very high prices)

For the dress code on the wedding, people here used to get the fanciest they can.

I asked you because some places would be more fun to visit with company, especially since there isn't much of a backpacker or solo travel culture in Tunisia.

Here's how I would spend the 7 days:

Take a flight from Tunis to Tozeur(desert city), spend two days there, go north for a day to Matmata where there is a cool hotel carved into the mountain.

Sfax for a day, we have some of the best if not the best seafood in Tunisia, our old town is also cool to walk around in, and my parents &amp; sister would be glad to host you.

Then Kairouan for a day, which used to be the capital, but make sure to stop by El Jam's Amphitheater on the way, it is one of the best preserved Roman stone ruins in the world, and is unique in Africa. Kairouan has a nice old town and a famous mosque, it's also famous for local sweets.

So: 2days Tozeur, 1 day Matmata, 1 day Sfax, 1 day Kairouan. Total 5 days. You have two days left, which I recommend to keep free, maybe you'll like a city enough to stay there longer than planned, maybe you'll get invited somewhere(you probably will).

I also strongly recommend using couchsurfing, many friends used it succesfully.

C'est vrai que en terme de mentalité c'est très différent, et qu'on est très déficitaire là dessus, mais ça n'a aucun rapport avec la superficie.

Mais si on veut être exact, la Tunisie est d'une façon prédominante couverte de desert, et la partie qui peux être exploitée est très réduite. Les pays qu'il a donné comme exemple sont beaucoup plus verdoyants, et disposent de réseaux de fleuves navigables qui facilitent beaucoup le commerce et l'accès aux régions  de l'intérieur, alors qu'en Tunisie dès que tu tu t'éloigne plus que 200 kilomètres de la cote ça devient difficile de développer une bonne économie, d'autant plus que pour améliorer la terre il faut un investissement considérable due au climat aride. On peut en voir l'effet direct par la densité de population: La Tunisie a 73 personnes / km², alors que la Suisse en a 211. Leur territoire dispose des ressources nécessaires pour soutenir une population importante pour une superficie réduite. En Tunisie le manque d'eau est un risque réel et considérable, et garder la population sous un seuil donné est primordial. Avec plus de personnes bien formées et compétentes (ça il faut qu'on travaille la dessus) on a une économie plus grande et une plus grande accumulation de richesse.

Sans parler du fait que sur le plan économique la Tunisie comme état moderne ne date même pas d'un siècle, alors que la Suisse par exemple a pu passer à coter des deux guerres mondiales sans souffrir et garder toutes son infrastructure. Le royaume uni est le premier pays à s'industrialiser, et le même état britannique actuel a une fois été le plus grand empire de l'histoire, et il n'a pas subit de défaite qui puisse vraiment le paralyser.",2019-03-06 19:03:07

Which side would you choose. You would definitely have to give up on one of them. 

So anything that could be reminiscent of a conflict of interest or even possibly the meere doubt of servicing foreign entity would be considered as treason.

If you look up the witch trials for example(Salem 16th century), it was a desperate attempt to control people (especially women who didn't obey or do what they were supposed to do). Hundreds of people (scape goats) were killed to satisfy the human fear of the unknown. If something bad happened (inexplicable deaths, plague, natural catastrophe..) people will look for someone to blame, and it's easier to cope if you have someone using sorcery to blame. ""That person did the evil, using magic"", that makes sense. It's easier to resume life normally if you can just justify the act, not accepting that it could be just a random event or that it has a logical explanation that you are not aware of. 

Even in Tunisia, if someone has a problem or fails , we tend to say ""athika 3in"", if someone falls in love in an unexpected manner ""se7rouh/se7rouha"". Just our soft version of throwing the blame on the supernatural and other people, just to say ""it wasn't me it was the others"". Typical .

You said that what you witnessed was not a huge thing, so it wasn't impressive or something? 
Can you tell me what you saw?",2019-03-17 10:51:50

ek4t5s6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/b9fxb4/,3,"More things I ran into. Try to be careful about making eye contact with men or even looking at them. I tend to be a people watcher. Like on the bus, without realizing it even, I tend to observe people. I didn't even realize I did this until I was accused of looking at a guy over there because I wanted to have sex with him. I was like, are you kidding me? I have zero interest in that guy. He looks weird so if I was staring at him that is why. Nope. They didn't buy it. They were pissed. I also got yelled at for joking back and forth with the male teenage children in the family. I was told that it looked like flirting. I was like, uh, no I wasn't flirting. I was just teasing one of them because he was going to meet a girl on a date and I thought it was kind of funny or cute that he was starting to get interested in girls so I asked him about her and what they were going to do on their date and I thought it was kind of funny that she had baked him a chocolate cake so I was like, this girl is definitely trying to impress you. For real, I was not flirting with this kid. But I got totally yelled at. 

So I've learned not to make eye contact or conversation at all except what is minimally necessary with males over there unless they are younger than like 8 years old. And you might think that you husband won't be like that because he isn't like that in America but you might surprised how he will revert back to the cultural standards there while he is there. Even if he doesn't, other people will interpret it that way and will look down on him for having a wife who is outwardly expressing sexual interest in other men so you will bring embarrassment to him.

So do yourself a favor and stick to hanging out with the female members of his family. And as much as possible talk to them. You can totally laugh and joke with them. Do not laugh or smile too much or talk too much with the males in his family or outside his family. It won't be seen as rude. That is normal over there. If you smile too much with the men, laugh too much, talk too much, make too much eye contact, they will all assume your are an American slut. 

And by the way, that is what they think about American and European females anyway so you will already be fighting that stereotype.

For the record though, don't believe that their females are so innocent. I happen to know many of them over there who cover their hair in public who I know for a fact are having sex with boys. So don't let them make you feel ashamed of being American and don't let them try to pull their bull shit story that their women are less promiscuous. Their women just do it secretly instead of being honest about what they are doing. They are fucking around and having sex before marriage and cheating on their husbands. You don't need to say that to them. You should not say that to them. But, just know that is the truth and hold your head up high. Don't let them try to shame you with their supposed moral superiority because they cover their hair or because they pretend to be a country of virgins and such.

Also, half the women do not cover their hair. Covering or not covering tells you absolutely nothing about how promiscuous a girl is over there. It is almost only a fashion statement. And often just a matter of pleasing their family. What they do when their parents aren't looking is a different story altogether.

Lots of abortions happen in that country by the way. Ask yourself why. There are legal brothels in the souks (medinas) there. They justify it by saying men need and have a right to a sexual outlet. Ask yourself if that isn't hypocritical considering how they judge Western culture to be promiscuous. ",2019-04-04 21:49:03

To have the 25GB of iternet with Orange what you do is to buy a simcard in an Orange shop in the airport or outsidz. and it's very cheap.

Then you buy a phone refill of 25 Dinars or more.
And then ask the shop to activate the 25GB offer of 4G for 25 Tunisian Dinars.

It was for me the cheapest way to get internet in Tunisia. Maybe in the Airport like in any other country, the shop they may overcharge so ask for the prices of simcard if it's more expensive than 5 bucks that means that they will over charge you and it's maybe cheaper to go in town in any other official shop to get one.

ek606su,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/b9g4xq/,3,"The education system inherited from the French colonizer was first reformed in order to combine the openness of the french language to modern sciences with the influence of arabic as one of the two identity tools (religion is the second one). 

For many years scientific courses were invariably taught in french from primary school to the university education. And to provide a high quality of scientific education Tunisia recruited from France high school and university teachers. 

As a result many generations grew up perfectly bilinguals but in harmony with their culture and identity. 

French teachers kept coming to the mid-seventies when due to political reasons and economic issues, reforms to give a bigger dimension to arabic started to take place. Since then many approaches were carried out, but they all failed to tackle the question of the right language to be used in scientific courses. Today while they are taught in arabic from the primary level to the junior high school, high school students have to learn them in french from local teachers who are less and less qualified in French. 

English remains at the 3rd position. Actually only students specialized in letters and languages may use it as a first or 2nd language. 

Obviously all this combined together gave birth to new generations of people who are quite unable to master any language or knowledge. This is why middle class families are more and more opting for private schools if they are unable to pay the fees of french or american education institutions in Tunisia.",2019-04-05 10:10:23

So you don’t have to ask for another one to enter to Germany since the purpose of the travel is the same as in France (tourism).

But if you want to study (whether in Germany or in France or elsewhere) you’ll have to apply for a study visa FROM YOUR COUNTRY first.

Yet if you are already abroad and want to change your visa situation (from a tourist to a student), it’ just IMPOSSIBLE due to security reasons. So you’ll be always asked  to leave the country to be in conformity with the law and than apply for the right visa FROM THE COUNTRY WHERE YOU LIVE and only from it.

Thanks for the information. That is exactly how I understand the situation and it feels good to hear that you have done the same thing. 

The only reason why I wanted reassurance is because of the difficulty of some procedures in our countries. For instance recently I went to Jordan. I was told by the Jordan embassy in London, Tunisia, Morocco, France, Canada, USA and a few other places that I needed a visa despite being a male (Moroccan and Tunisian MEN do not need a visa). I contacted so many embassies because I reviewed the law myself and several sources which made me sure I didn't need a visa. Anyway I spent a lot of money applying for a visa (which is free to issue but I need application fees and various documents which cost time and money to obtain) and then when I applied the embassy called me and stated that I didn't need a visa and I should not have bothered to apply. It was a nightmare experience with different consular staff telling me off and shouting at me for no reason and for the errors they made. 

  
The next issue would be how to prove my address to the consulat du Maroc au Tunis. I will cross that bridge when it comes.

OK so if you're in a big city like Tunis and you're taking the bus/metro you can wear your purse. Just don't wear those tiny side purses because that is literally a pickpocket beacon. 

Passport should stay at home. Which reminds me: Put all your valuable in your CARRY-ON. Airport baggage handlers/cops steal shit oftentimes (cash, pricey food, electronics, etc.)

Keep your money in your bank account and double-check to be sure no one ever sees your code. (duh.) If you feel some people are trying to guilt-trip you... Being clingy... etc. ditch 'em. Real friends don't try to get free stuff from you.

&gt; Also, I'm on medication right now that will run out in 3 months time

You should get travel insurance. [This](https://www.insureandgo.com/travel-insurance/travel-insurance-for-medical-conditions) might be helpful. Although medecine is usually cheap in Tunisia (by western standards), but pharmacy shortages sometimes happen. 

You should probably talk to someone with experience with this. If your French is decent you could try calling [here](https://www.maghrebia.com.tn/site/fr/contact.php?id_article=12) as they might be helpful.",2019-05-09 12:13:08

Just don't compare yourself to others and focus on yourself .

Also , try to avoid doing a ""récapitulation ""  the night before the exam and the morning before the exam, although you may already \*do\* know this , but checking few notes last minute won't ""yzidek hata chay"" , you think you will forget stuff during the exam , but as soon as you sit for it you will realize you didn't forget what you have studied for throughout the year.

Try to tell your family beforehand , especially your parents , not to ask you ""shaamlt"" everyday  you come home from an exam, tell them to only ask you after it's all over. You don't want them to remind you of a bad exam (lottf) , and trust me you don't want to see that diappointed look on your parents , especially moms. So either tell them not to ask you how you did , or always say that you did good.

DON'T ASK YOUR FRIENDS how they did after the exam, just don't talk about it ,and don't compare answers , I'm sure you already know this.

you won't find time to eat during the exam xD you might even forget that you even have food with you , at least that was the case for me.

eonv79x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/bsjbfh/,3,"I am a huge lover of the Tunisian South.

You can devide the area to three parts.

The most attractive part in terms of tourism is the Djerid (mainly in the West, even though technically it stretches to the East far enough). This a land of green Oasis, water that come out of dry rocks, salty marches, and dunes. It is kind of a must do in the South. You can rant tours that will give you all your typical experiences of the Sahara (tours on top of a camel, sand dunes, sweet sweet dates...).

The second part is Djerba and Zarzis, were the desert meets the sea. Djerba's beaches have a particular charm in them, and you can find on the island one of the oldest Jewish temples still standing and used as a place of worship. Djerba is a touristy area so you can find all the commodities easily.

The third part is the South East, mainly around Tataouine.  I will give more details about it because it tends to be less advertised (so be aware that there will be less touristy commodities). That being said, if you are interested in a stunning and non-cliché visit I highly recommend the villages and Ksours around Tataouine. The villages were built on top of rocky hills with local stones and look as ancient and as beautiful as the nature around them. People used to extend their homes directly by carving into the rock. It's stunning.
Chnenni and Matmata are the best known of these villages, but Douiret and Germessa are also very beautiful (and less touristy). If you are in the surroundings, you should also visit Ksar Ouled Soltan, which is a very good example of the Ksours: these are ""forts"" built by semi nomadic tribes of the desert in order to store and protect their agricultural yields.



Two practical points:

1. If you are not very used to hot weather, be aware that the far you get from the sea, the more extreme it will get. Djerba being already quiet hot in the summer.

2. There is absolutely no security risk whatsoever, I actually felt more secure in the South than in my home city (Sfax).",2019-05-24 18:26:12

Tunisia does not benefit from their American consumption - they do not pay taxes to Tunisia on their high displacement cars. Tunisia has to absorb the pollution, however.

Libyans like to buy houses outright, rent from fellow Libyans or, as a final resort, from Tunisians. Taxes on real estate for non-residents is 1% versus 6% - Tunisia looses out on taxes when foreigners buy real estate to ""attract foreign investment"" lmao. Any profit earned by a house rented out by a Libyan to another Libyan recirculates around the Libyan economy, without being taxed by the Tunisian government

Russians are more of an asset with their non-subsidized tourism and you with you guys scamming them with $20 hamsas than Libyans lmao

Like others said, Sidi Bou Said and Carthage are going to be you best bets for hanging out in the evening.  In my experience as a foreigner living here, there generally aren't any problems walking around at night so long as you try not to take out your phone, keep money hidden, etc.

If you have a day to relax, be sure to visit the beaches in Hammamet (45 mins out by louage or train, a bit more Europeans) or Raf Raf (an hour drive, don't know about public transit going there, cheaper, mostly Tunisians there)-- it's the perfect time of the year for it.  There are also solid beaches in Carthage.

One other thing-- when getting in taxis, be sure to look at the meter.  In day time, it should say ""1"" on it and start at 0.500 dinars.  At night (usually around 8ish), it changes to ""2.""  Some taxi drivers like to take advantage of visitors and won't turn on the meter, instead charging higher prices once you arrive at your destination.  If the meter if off, just say ""monsieur, le compteur s'il vous plait.""  Taking a taxi from the airport, drivers won't turn on the meter.  Going to your hotel should be 10-15 dinars (which is higher than it would be for normal meters) or 20-30 if you're arriving at night.

eqrf37t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/bw61bw/,3,"So, I dont know anyone that raised their kids in Libya upon being given assylum, but I know plenty of Libyans that studied in Libyan schools abroad. I studied in an Arab (Saudi) school until the age of 13.

The reasons are simply:
1. If you are in the west on an education visa or temporary work visa (this is the most common scenario), chances are you will need to return to Libya when your studies are done. If the kids don't have a Libyan certificate they will be forced to go back to the last year in which they acquired a certificate, potentially wasting 3- 4 years. 
2. Seeking assylum isn't necessarily a best option. A Libyan professional would find it very difficult to get a job in the west. On paper, their education is less valuable than most African countries. Living as an assylum seeker in Europe is a lot worse than living as a doctor in Libya even though the pay might not be different much in absolute terms. 
3. The vast majority of religious Arabs in the UK (where I live) will put their children in an Arabic school so that they can learn about Arabic language and religion. In the west, you are required to attend a school with an approved government curriculum, so the Libyan curriculum is not a substitute to western education.. Arab schools normally run in the weekend or the evenings.. we still went to normal school lol.

I personally really enjoyed Arabic school growing up. IMO, I think it does help with integration (I know that sounds counterintuitive). There was an emphasis on religion, which I think was positive because it gives you a chance to actually discuss and talk about religion in an environment where you won't get beat up (because of the law) and you're not just getting one sided information from your parents.. I'm an athiest now lol so I guess it didn't work but I mean information is a good thing",2019-06-11 13:19:41

eqyrbw4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/bztoh9/,3,"You are mixing the Palestinian Authorities and Hamas, like real bad (the PAs leadership are the ones who have luxury residences in Dubai. The others don't). The Palestinians in the West Bank are not resisting and fighting anymore (nor is there any ""religious indoctrination"" going on there), yet look how they are being rewarded by Israel and the West Bank is going to be annexed eventually.

Had the Arabs accepted ""peace"" and the land partition with Israel earlier, in the many proposed land partition plans, it's more than likely that Israel would have tried to encroach on the what would-have-been the state of Palestine ANYWAY. This is reinforced not just by their current encroachements on the West Bank, but the fact that they routinely encroached on other countries WHILE AT PEACE WITH THEM : Egypt in the 1956 ""triple agression"", Lebanon, bombing the nuclear reactors in Iraq, and even going so far as to bomb TUNISIA ITSELF, just for hosting Arafat. UNDER BOURGUIBA HIMSELF !! Despite having no previous wars with Tunisia, and not being a danger at all to them. 

You'd think a formal State of Palestine, right next to the Israel we both know, would have survived until now ?! Just because it gained ""formality"" and recognition from the rest of thr world? Like, can international denounciations stop a sufficiently armed bully nation from strangling a weaker neighboir? Did it stop the US invading Iraq in 2003? Russia in Ukraine? Does it stop Israel now? Etc etc...

Could the Palestinians done very differently in resisting Israeli encroachements, had they a ""state"" from 1948? Would the Israelis let them even have a comparable defensive army right next to themselves? Would they have even given them time to regroup and build ?!?! We'd just be like today really, minus a few minor points...

Hence the reason for why choosing continued resistance wasn't a bad choice, and it had a chance to change things for real, it was just done very poorly by most parties involved ( for reasons that are too long to post here).

What's more, the Arabs (and other minorities) who stayed in Israel after 1948 are currently losing more rights to the Jewish majority, they haven't been left unscathed at all. Look at the religous indoctrination that never left Israel (not just ""our"" religious indoctrination). Go look and read all the stuff going on there. If you do then you'll know that we'd have never gotten enough money, nor opportunities, to compensate for what we would have lost even if we would have just let them roll over us with impunity.

And keep in mind that before Zionist Israel, there was Zionist Militias who made plenty of terrorist attacks against innocent people

"" 1967 - Preemptive strike against Egypt aka Nassar is a fucking idiot. When a country who whipped your ass says, if you close the straight of Tiran, we’ll consider it an act of war, maybe you should listen? Syria was tricked into the war and lost the Golan. Israel begged King Hussein of Jordan not to attack but he didn’t want to look like a bitch, bad decision. I bet you didn’t know that when Jordan controlled West Bank they destroyed Jewish and Christian sites, during the six day war, Israeli soldiers did not use automatic weapons in Jerusalem as to not damage the holy sites. Al Aqsa was also recaptured but we gave it back the next day...never saw an Arab country do similar. ""

Egypt never really wanted to start another war and the Israeli attack was completely done by surprise, Syria was allied with Egypt and both of them were even one country, the United Arab republic, so it was clear that Syria will join and losing Golan heights wasn't because they were weak, it's because the Syria president was a coward just like Jordanian King whose father made an agreement with the first president of Israel that Jordan will be a friend of Zionist Israel :  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faisal%E2%80%93Weizmann\_Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faisal%E2%80%93Weizmann_Agreement) 

and speaking of religious sites, i would like to see the source of what you claimed that Jordanians did because i never heard of it but what i know is that Israel did attack religious sites of Christians and Muslims in Jerusalem to this day and if you don't believe me, go to check it out on the internet, they can be found easily and btw, Al aqsa isn't back, it's still under Israeli control

Everyone have to protect their people but attacking and violation the sovereignty isn't a good thing, they also made a big damage to the Ugandan military by destroying a quarter of Uganda's air force and killing large number of Ugandan soldiers

You can go by with Arab (assuming you are not a pure blooded Amazighi with strong ties to the community) since it is classified as a pan-ethnic group but really Arab identity is socio-linguistic, not genetic.

You are also African since Tunis is in Africa and the Berbers are indigenous to the continent. Africa is a huge landmass with the greatest genetic diversity on the planet. It is also 8,000 km long with different climates so you will be bound to find light skinned people here despite the common notion that Africans are just black.      
 
you can be all of those identities you have listed and there is no conflict with them except for the white part since it is a question of semantics but many people hold that white is synonymous with being of European descent so even though you might have white skin, you will not be considered white but still Caucasian. 

Genes are a controversial subject since ethnicity is tied closely to culture and I would not bother too much with it. Nevertheless, You would have other admixtures that come into play like some West African, Middle Eastern, and Southern European blood, some Tunisians have Northern European blood thanks to the Vandals as well. 

To answer your final question, All Tunisians are Africans, Most are mixed with a strong Arab-Berber component and a minority of full blood Amazigh and are generally Caucasian unless they they are black (and there are a number of Black Tunisians)",2019-06-18 21:02:30

It's late so I will do a quick summary.   
Morocco and Tunisia wants that industry. We have high unemployment and low enterprise in these areas. There are also domestic export issues (to the EU for instance) v the EU taking care of its own interest (exploiting us as cheap labour and letting EU companies import). So unlike, say Singapore, who was able to transfer knowledge from foreign companies to domestic ones, we can't.

Then these contracts represent a huge amount of FDI and hard foreign currency. We also have high unemployment. We are competing between getting these new plants and keeping them, whereas say other countries are not put in such a position (e.g. Northern Ireland makes wings, Germany makes engines). Here you will note that if a foreign company needs to make... seats and... erm.. radar equipment... they will actually go to the Tunisian and Moroccan governments one after the other and see who gives them the sweet deal, rather than offering one to one and one to the other on mutually favourable terms.

And here's some unsollicited advice if you're up for a long read;
Two major choices for bac technique when it comes to colleges;
Either INSAT or preparatory school for engineering studies ( best is IPEIM for ""techno"") having done the latter of the two I can't wholehrartedly recommend it... 
So, I guess INSAT is the superior choice in my opinion.
Architecture is OK if you're artistically inclined, you're definetely going to enjoy the experience, but the professional life isn't as clear cut as other choices (may struggle for a good bit before having financial stability).
This is of course assuming you don't qualify for a scholarship or aren't financially able to study abroad, if it isn't the case, there's no debating it, GO FOR IT!
Anyways, sorry for the lengthy comment, and do PM me if you want more insight or further details about the IPEI and why I don't recommend it, since my reasons are in no way universal and it could very well be  a good fit for you.",2019-06-29 22:34:46

Sacrifices to guarantee children’s future and well being are the greatest joy and pride that parents may feel.

Financially speaking your parents situation in Tunisia should not be unlivable even  if you couldn’t afford that amount of money. Yes I’m sure they would find a way or an other to live in dignity. 

Yet their big problem and real challenge are to leave both of you and to have to live far from you and without the hope to see you today, tomorrow or the days after. In fact they would feel frustrated even if you manage to visit them from time to time.

The impact of such an emotional separation is terribly huge even if they say they would “survive “ thanks to new communications technologies.

etxkwcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/cdh2zq/,3,"I still remember my mother telling me stories about WWII, how locals in her tunisian coastal village situated in the central part of the country, offered hospitality to refugees who fled their homes when war just broke out in big cities.

During first months of the conflict her village was a safe-heaven to muslims and jews as well as to a few malteese. But that peaceful place was in turn crossed by Axis and allied forces concurrently. At that time Tunisia was a French property, but since maréchal Pétain governed from Vichy, only Mussolini’s army was dominating the colony.

My mother was then just 9 years old, but she still remembers those long nights which her father spent his ear stuck to his newly bought  magic box from which resonated a voice of an arab speaker who on behalf of what he repeatedly called "" radio London"", constantly delivered late breaking news of the terrible war that was going somewhere between Egypt and Libya.

In fact, she hardly understood what war really meant, yet she was scared by the far sounds of air bombing. But it was Italian military convoys that were more and more frequently crossing the village towards the south, which frightened her the most.

And as times went by, she watched incredulously the moment when Italians were unable to advance further than a large field situated between her father’s olive farm and the Mediterranean sea. There the italian army camped a few weeks hoping for a hypothetical miracle of an impossible victory.

In the meanwhile local people who were living from farming and fishing established some timid contacts with that particularly big and powerful new neighbor. But they quickly resolved to keep their distance as a reaction to a largely shared disrespectful behavior of  italian forces. Until their departure, later on, children were not allowed to come in proximity of that field.

On the contrary, the German army which suddenly erupted in masses there after withdrawing from the southern parts of the country, tried to provide compassion and to appear kind and gentle with children although they rarely had anything to offer.

My mother experienced that reality the day the germans proceeded towards the north. The story occurred at the dawning of their departure when a german offered to my mother a weird gift after she filled his bottle with drinkable water. Unable to provide a present the soldier just ceded his metal cutting shears as a reward.

Obviously she shares the view according to which many nazi soldiers were war criminals since they were commanded by Hitler, but germans of her neighborhood were so different from the arabic description coming from her father’s speaking box and so divergent from the version defended by Bourguiba, the tunisian national leader.

She claims that although they appeared exhausted and in a quite critical situation those germans always managed to protect locals from any potential dangers. For example when allied air bombings were expected, civilians were asked to flee to secure areas surrounding the village.

But the german did not camp for a long time there. Since their military leader decided a renewed tactical withdrawal just before allied forces carried out a spectacular field progression during which troops were airdropped in the surrounding countryside.

When speaking on these allied forces, my mother as common people, likes to distinguish between the French the British and the Americans. Seeing their colonial status, the French were widely disliked and their absence from tunisian battlefields was subject to popular derision.

According to her, the British were the most polite and correctly dressed soldiers who ever camped there, but they avoided establishing close contacts with civilians and almost seemed to be mean too. Unlike the Americans, who were very cool and open and also extremely generous, offering cigarettes to men and sweeties to kids.

She also told me that thanks to Americans, many locals wined the icing on the cake. Thus, they were able to beautify their poor houses and to improve their quality of life, through sewing white curtains, white bed sheets, white dresses and shirts and white foulards too. A few of them even earned money out of this white tissue which they undoubtedly valued as a silk textile.

Useless to relate her stories on people’s fighting to pick up the big quantity of silk that was  laying on the ground of the surrounding countryside.

Actually at that time Tunisians did not know that in the US a new synthetic product called nylon was recently invented, which allowed a huge production of military parachutes that were put at the disposal of americans in Europe, in North Africa, in Asia and in the Pacific.

Till today my mother still remembers how American soldiers respected poor people and tried their best to let them feel moments of pure happiness. This is why they regularly gathered kids through calling them by the names of Mohamed for boys and Fatima for girls to offer them chocolates, and make them taste the unique flavor of chewing-gums and discover that carbonated drink contained in highly attractive curvy bottles called coke cola.

Although, she ate, chewed and drunk at several occasions, yet my mother still disapproves the way the soldiers called girls, not because she eventually dislikes the name of Fatima, but rather because people in Tunisia use the name of Fatma instead (without the ""i""). And according to her, american soldiers were unable to understand that there is no Fatima in Tunisia.

This is why I am convinced that, not to disappoint my mother, the US military authorities should have emphazised the importance of small dialectal differences between communities and regions in the amazing informations contained in that pocket guide so that american soldiers would have been aware not to pronounce that name everywhere in the maghreb, the way they heard it in Morocco when they first debarked in North Africa.",2019-07-16 18:26:04

Example:
I was in a reataurant trying to get a sandwitch while a guy comes with his friend talking about how religions are a mythology used to explain unexplained things like death i was really into their discussion, smart and logic talk and they didn't disrespect islam in any sort, they said that religions are important though.
While they are minding their own business people started giving them the LOOK like they killed their children or something, and a guy comes out of nowhere started arguing with them and he started screaming and people started going around them like wasps promising them that they will suffer and shit got bad 'till the men isulted their religion and left without paying.

eu8ley1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/cd3d1y/,3,"Now concerning computer science. I agree with previous comments who said that it's the future. I used to have the same mindset, and itwas the one thing keeping me from dropping out of med school back then. I used to think that medicine = saving lives and helping people. And that was it. But no. Technology saves lives too. In fact, objectively speaking, technology is the biggest and most powerful life-changer ever. And with it you could save even millions of lives. Indirectly maybe, but if you create something, a machine let's say, that helps all those other jobs like doctors, firefighters, policemen, etc, do their job, you indirectly saved all those lives too. And let's not mention if you did create biomedical tools, or applications, like the detectors of strokes and heart attacks and all that. You directly influenced a person's life-span. And that's where the future is. Doctors are losing influence to machines and AI. After a decade or two, I'm imagining that all surgeries will be done by AI, because it's way more precise than the human eye and hand. I'd guess that only the clinical survey might be done by doctors, and that's simply due to human contact's importance and the confidance coming through face-to-face contact, nothing else. Because AI and data mining is certainly advancing to a point that a couple searches in the user's history of purchases and cameras etc (especially if internet of things starts getting implemented and objects do become intertwined and all), than AIs would draw a lot more accurate and realistic understandings of the profile of the patient, and thus a more accurate diagnosis than the responses a patient could ever provide to the clinical survey. As for the rest of the clinical assessement, a neutral machine would probably be more accurate at doing it than a human being just like surgeries.

CS engineering isn't just working 8 hours in front of a desk in an unknown office doing some obscure app. True, that's what most people with ""mosmar fi 7it"" mentality do and good for them if that makes them happy. But you could do way more grand things with technology. You could build your own startup and business. And no, business isn't EVIL. It doesn't have to resolve around money or fame. You could make it based on a product that helps humanity. If you're passionate about medicine, it could be a medical tool for example that changes the rules of the game completely. And people with power aren't BAD. It depends on how you use that power. You could use that influence to inspire people to do great things, to be good people, to remind them of important messages. Most people have a horde mentality. And they follow what's more popular. So it's good to make the popular things, the good things. And it's the role of successful people to instill the ""popular"" values in the rest. So let's make the good values what's popular! It's bad right now (in tunisia) simply because the popular people don't care enough to spread goodness, or are even doing some negative influence. That's why it's great to have some positive influence to balance the equation xD

That is if you want the prestige you mentioned. Because medicine is losing it day after day.

On the other hand, I can hear you questioning about money issues in terms of founding the startup and all. But what's good about it is you can take your time. It's just 5 years of study as opposed to medicine's 9-12 (or more). And then, you could work for even ten years or twenty or thirty before adventuring into the entrepreneurship world. There are people who start in their sixties! You can take your own pace. If you need steady income at first just work normally. And income in the CS field is good. During the first year or so it's meh, around 700-800dt, but it increases a lot. If you become project manager in a big company you can even reach the 30-40 millions (but that generally requires about 10 years of experience from what I heard). It comes down to how serious you are ofc. If you never work and just waste time, no one would promote your rank. So work hard, be smart and snatch opportunities when they present themselves!

And ofc, all of this wall of text is meaningless at the face of one thing only: how much you LOVE what you do. You can't excell at anything unless you love it. And to acquire the good things of some things, you need to excell at it, which needs HARD work, which needs love and dedication. So simply, just sincerely ask yourself: ""which do I like the most?"" and answer honestly. Don't try to decieve yourself, or talk-yourself through it with logic, even if the ""reel"" answer is none of the two! ANY carrer can make you successful. Sometimes you just need to follow a not-so-traditional route to success, which may not be so obvious to most people. But definitely do not study something you don't like, you'll regret it later, you'll suffer in skin-tearing pain, and it'll send you into spiraling thoughts coming out of hell. Be true to yourself. Always. That's the secret to success. If you love something, you'll definitely find a way to make it work out. If you hate it, you'll keep struggling in agony to ""meet up expectations"" for as long as you can, and when you run out of breath you'll give up like dead meat, and you'll start questioning everything about yourself and get stuck into a cycle of self-loath, feeling of failure, and low self-esteem. Never gamble with your self-esteem. It's hard to rebuild. Listen to no one, and never work for other people's expectations or dreams. If you love medicine do it. If you love cs do it. If you love neither don't do them. If you simply lack information about them, start searching and reading now! It's a good first step that you asked here. The more you know the better, because you'll be making an informed decision, which is great.

And if you have any other questions don't hesitate to ask!",2019-07-19 18:03:28

Good to hear that you chose your passion!

As for the university... Tbh, I'm not fond of the prepa system. It's faulty and risky in Tunisia. The best state engineering schools in terms of CS are Polytech, Sup-Com, ENIT, ENSI and INSAT. The first four are VERY competitive, and the CS specialty in the ""concours prépa"" is one of the most desired ones, so it's even more competitive and selective. You may be the top student in your class and still not make it due to bad luck on the day of the exam or simply because your prof was stupid enough to neglect to teach you an important part of the program which happened to be in the test (happened to some of my friends)... It's risky playground. So no, it's not enough to succeed in prepa. You gotta be among the top 200 or something? (not sure about the exact numbers, but I know you need to be among the top rankers). Many find themselves doing chemical engineering or whatever and find themselves obliged to go to the private schools to study CS, and that costs millions, so you can't afford to do that.

And prepa is a lot of stress over stress over stress. I know many people who were driven to depression because of its hellish pace. And as soon as you let go for a bit, you find yourself left behind, and then it's hard to catch up in time for the ""concours"".

**PS:** I'm in ESPRIT and all of the above is what happened to my friends and **many** of the students who come study here. Sad cases of prepa left-overs. Succeeded in the ""concours"" but didn't get good enough ranking for CS. So they had no choice but to now spend money to study what they wanted. And many of them are still struggling with their new low self-esteem and depression and can't get back their old work ethics.

In my opinion, for someone who's ***certain*** he wants to do only CS and is not content with simply ""anything as long as it's engineering"", there's no need to put yourself through prepa's risk and hardships. The best universities for such a person in Tunisia are either INSAT or ESPRIT. In both your future is garanteed and you'll be certain you'll be a CS engineer eventually and not something else by mistake. ESPRIT has an edge for anyone who wants to go abroad thanks to its CTI and EUR-ACE labels. But as you don't want to leave Tunisia, you have no need for it.

So, the most optimal choice in your case is indeed INSAT. It has a 5-year curriculum, after which you become a software engineer, in different specialties by choice. Their curriculum is better than Sup-Com, ENIT or ENSI who cram 5 years worth of material in only 3, and hence skipping over many important fondamental stuff. And INSAT, from what I hear from my friends, follows the french program and has conventions with universities abroad for exchange programs and such. Its first two years are hard and selective however. Especially the second year. It's the ""prépa intégrée"" system. After those two years there's ranking. If you don't make the cut, they put you in the ""licence"" curriculum, so you just finish another year, get a ""licence"" and leave the school. But if you make the cut (which is the majority of students I think, only a few fail the exam so don't worry), you get to continue the engineering curriculum, and three more years to go.

In terms of future, the 5 of the universities mentioned above have nearly equal chances of employment and all and the differences are minor (aside from Polytech students, whom, the majority of go directly finish their studies in France, but they're like 30 people, the top of the nation, so they're pre-selected for that goal in mind from the beginning).

So don't worry about your future **after** studies in either of these, it's **during** studies that CS students need to worry about. The CS field is expanding and still growing, and work is available, and many startups are being founded in Tunisia and it's on a growing curve, so students from all those top universities will be seeked after by employers. And I hear INSAT's alumni community is among the strongest and best ones actually (which means easier networking, more employment opportunities, etc).

Edit: concerning the rent. I think INSAT has a dorm. Which naturally would be more affordable than rent.

Edit 2: concerning 

&gt;  No one has ever said what you said. 

It's actually what my own search taught me (both search on the internet and search inside of myself, before, during and after my two experiences in med school and esprit) You can say it's the conclusions I came to after the roller coster I went through during the last 5 years xD And it's what I wish someone told me back in bac before listening to family and choosing medicine like an idiot without doing proper research.",2019-07-19 19:18:30

First of all about your Day 2 you must add La Marsa to your list (even though its Corniche is a cliché).
Spending the day in Sousse then the evening in Hammamet will be a little hard to do considering that these two places aren’t really close to each other. (Night life in Hammamet and Sousse are pretty nice)
Having to share a room could possibly cause you problems, so I recommend you having separate rooms.

There have been a thread like this the last weeks or so, check my comments to find it, though I didn't find it in myself to talk about my experience in depth. 

==
I'm just not sure how hard it is to become an engineer in INSAT (I'm asking for you now), but I can assure you that unless you're sure you're OK with not expecting anything from 99% of the professors/administration of ENSI (they really don't care about you or any problem you have, they'll only do what they think is the bare minimum they owe you -or nothing at all-, then fuck off to care about only their comfort or pockets. Expect most of your emails to be ignored, no serious guidance in your projects, or no interesting projects for that matter, unless you find them yourself and do EVERYTHING yourself), that you're OK with treating it like an additional 3 years of prépa where there is more math and other theoritical stuff than actual cool and practical CS stuff (I am serious, إياك ثم إياك انهم يغلطوك ويمشي في بالك باش تعمل حاجة في الانسي تشبه للجامعات المشهورة الامريكية. إياك...), where your presence in every class is obligatory and you'll get harassed about it about any incompetent professor like you owe them money or something..., where most of the students tend to be the 'studious/indifferent/boring' types you're most likely fed up with from your 2 years of prépa(unless you managed to become one of them :v ), where the 'programme' and the walls and the classes and everything smells old and boring (expect to spend most of your free time learning modern technologies you need for your carrer and projects instead of ENSI teaching them to you), then yeah, your best bet by far is INSAT. It won't be worse than having to do everything yourself, or else it's an automatic fail.",2019-07-20 15:34:27

But in my experience, I dressed modestly at the recommendation of my archeology professor. Pants and loose long sleeve shirts, and a good sun hat.

Culturally, it was fine to dress that way. At the time, there was a broad variety of clothing styles. But I discovered that the loose lightweight clothes were more effective in protecting me from the sun and heat! If my arms were bare, I’d get a sun rash.

evu682l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/ckqvv4/,3,"I am currently studying at ENIT but do not live at El Manar, so I can only help you with a few things.

You can find a wide variety of fast food close to campus, varying from affordable and decent to expensive and tasty.  
There's a Monoprix and a Carrefour Express there, there's also a 24h 7ammas in front of the clinic.

For photocopying you have every service available and you can get some courses from last year at Zohra or any other adjacent Xerox shop.

Café wise there are a few coffee shops which seem decent enough, La Rosa/Cafe In are slightly fancy, Coeur Sucré or whatever is for couples, and there are a few men exclusive coffee shops.

To get a haircut there's a barber behind the building where there's a big sign ""Resto Turque"", It's the one next to Elissa. If you're lost just ask for a coffee shop called ""Cesar"", you'll find most students loitering there. There's also a ""Pressing"" and a daytime Pharmacy. 

The coffee shop next to Cinema Amilcar is smoker free and has a few entertainments available (uno deck of cards, chess, etc).

Transport-wise, the Campus is well connected to the bus network and to get the ""metro"", you'll walk past the University building, through a tunnel and you'll find a station that'll take you to ""El Passage"".

In front of FST there's a small box shop that makes juice and cocktails, there's also a guy selling cigarettes if you're a smoker.

If you want to hail for a taxi cab I would suggest  to go the roundabout under the route X bridge, or to the clinic for a better chance of finding one.

You can have both lunch and dinner at the ""restaurant universitaire"" behind ENIT.

After 22h00 Manar is pretty much a desert like other redditors have said.

There's literally litter everywhere in Tunisia even the country side. I think people's attitudes need to change. This is not OK. I often hold my litter for an extended time to make sure it is properly disposed of. There is no excuse.

In Tunisia I told people off in a (in a non-aggressive way) and the public were ... scared for me?

One time street children were throwing large rocks at the trains cracking the windows. We was stopped on the tracks. I opened the door which was broken and told a boy to come here. I asked him (with everyone watching) why he felt it OK to smash train windows. He said Tunisia is shit. I said maybe it's shit because you are smashing it up and doing nothing to improve it. If he caused me any threat I'd have had no problem to slap him across the face so I wasn't scared - but of course if I though it'd be such an encounter I wouldn't of said anything.

Gotta be patient with the Tunisian administrations cos they could be really torturing sometimes.
Honestly for travelling around, some people would rent cars and go on road trips but if u don't feel like it, I recommend u search on Facebook : randonnée or excursion [name of the area u wanna visit], I traveled all around Tunisia that way, perhaps u don't get to travel at ur own pace, but they generally offer very good prices and u get access to places u couldn't possibly get to through normal public transport means.
Places I recommend visiting:

4 days trips to the south :Djerba- tozeur

Bizerte to all the costal areas, really amazing views

3 days trip to tabarka/Ain drahem esp during  winter 

Korbos and hawaria are really nice too

I heard they organize small trips to Galite Island ( it's more complicated, I still wanna go there myself one day)

Depending on where u gonna be living, I think u ll probably visit sousse/Tunis /monastir anyways.

Tunisians are really active on fb, so join their groups, lots of ppl post in French there ( on a voyagé pour vous /bon et mauvais plans /on a mangé pour vous / lost and found Tunisia)

According to the Quran and the Prophet of Islam, Abraham (Ibrahim) was tasked by God to kill his firstborn son Ishmael (Ismail) in order to test Abraham's obedience. Abraham obeyed and as he attempted to slaughter his own son, God sent Abraham a sheep as a ransom for Ishmael's life and ordered him to slaughter the sheep instead.

This is why Muslims all around the world celebrate  Eid-Al-Adha every year by slaughtering a sheep at home as an offering to God. One third of the meat is donated to the poor.

Now tradition and Islamic teachings oblige us to do the slaughter first thing in the morning after the Eid prayer, so hopefully you won't be exposed to any shocking scenery.

After cleaning, cutting the meat and storing it, the whole family gathers for an endless BBQ. There's usually lots of Coke and Lemonade to wash the food down.

Some background : I'm basically that SC exp guy who got was getting the same 11/20 Mel 2eme until the bac while studying the night of the exam a maximum of 10 exams throughout the year ( and no , I'm not one of those bullshitting . I legit didn't know shit nor learned anything. ) 
Alright so here we go : 
- Don't hesitate a second to ask your teacher for clarification ( post course . I'm sure most will be very keen to explain you stuff without wasting time from the lesson ) and LISTEN TO THEM VERY CAREFULLY ( honestly I got 15 svt x4 fel bac thanks to simply listening to my teacher explaining the whole course while others mocked the dude and joked about writing so little in 2 hours . ) 
- English , French and Arabic are a joke ( unless ure lettre where everything except Philo and Arabic is a joke ) . Focus on securing the grammar part of those and try to simply read or watch interesting stuff about the different themes , pay attention to capitalisation and the format . You'll get 15+ in the first two and 10 in the latter . 
- if you're dumb fel info don't panic ( no , if you're truly thalma you won't easily get 10 as a lot of ppl claim but you will most definitely get at least 7 ) . Simply check some bac pratique videos and make your own conclusion on what repeats itself . 
- I got my bac with 5 in physics and 4 in maths while knowing virtually nothing about both . I'm not joking when I tell you can get those marks by studying them the night of the exam . In my case I knew proba would be up there for 3 point minimum , along with espace for 4+ points . I also knew the scientific text in physics is something I shouldnt fuck up and that it will most likely include the last chapters and some specific questions that are usually repeated throughout the years .
- bac sport is a joke . Unless you want 18+ don't waste a minute of your time on it . 
- make sure to have 10 annual . It's crucial if you're under risk of getting a9al men 10 fel bac . 
 
That being said it's still August so don't be a lazy cunt like I was for 3 years straight . Go and start working on the easiest things and slowly you'll get to the tough shit . If you didn't manage to do it then there's still those 2 weeks before the bac that are more than enough to secure a success if you work 4+ hours a day . 
Etude is overrated and if you really need help ( who doesn't ? ) Check out taki academy. For just 70dt you'll essentially have all the freaking subjects . 
Good luck !",2019-08-13 18:19:42

FYI:

&gt;A music genre is a conventional category that identifies some pieces of music as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions.It is to be distinguished from musical form and musical style, although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably.Recently, academics have argued that categorizing music by genre is inaccurate and outdated.

ex1hgjn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/cr0jp7/,3,"This is not an answer but a thought. I never imagined tunisian - europeans (brexit did not start i think) having trouble with dating from both sides of the sea.

Don't expect to ""find"" a tunisian girl with england-level-english. Be realistic, work on your tunisian. (this is also a great excuse to approach girls).

Expand your social circle in tunisia. Basically, the usual way to meet a girl but in alot less time. Go out with your cousins, they should know people, approach people and be sociable.

You might think that tunisians are so progressive that they date just for the fun of it just like western cultures, that's not the case. Anybody in this sub can refute me.

The last thing: you contradict yourself:  you want a girl that

I study finance (masters) and we had to do numerous presentations about the academic literature. Finance is a field of study mostly written in English (even the french write in english), so what I proposed to my professors that I'll do my presentation in English and they frowned upon me. Claiming,  why not french, we teach in french so use french. But after convincing them they let me and to my surprise I had no feedback even from my colleagues whom i thought they spoke good english. They asked in french and I had to respond in french which was disappointing.

Now, english is for sure very juvenile in tunisia and even the small minority who speak it, don't really speak it well enough to the international standard. (they mostly learn some phrases from movies and tv shows but they can't conduct a conversation about a topic) It has become a sort of trend in these past years and people think it's cool to throw some words in english.

I know things are changing now but that superiority attitude annoyed me so much. Having said that, I feel that the majority of Egyptians are nice people.",2019-08-28 14:25:51

ezpn0uo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/d1ryff/,3,"Not sure I can help much with philosophy and computer science ( Got around 8 in both fel bac sc exp )

But concerning SVT I don't think there's anything worth a revise when it comes to 2nd grade . You should simply review the genetics part of the 3rd grade as it's in continuation with the program of the bac .

I assume it depends on the teacher but for me listening to the prof fel SVT was enough to completely understand the lesson and all I had to do the day before the exams was to slowly read my copybook ( slow since I'll read the experiences , take my time memorizing and understand them , then reading the conclusions and having a look at what the book offers in that specific section ) and then read the resume  at the end of each course fel kteb . I was extremely lazy and so spent usually just 5 hours max studying for devoirat and it was enough for 15+ .

At the end of the year I simply spent about 5 or 4 days reviewing the book and it was more than enough ( ended up with 15/20 fel svt , time cucked me ) .

**tl;dr LISTEN TO UR TEACHER / READ THE SCHOOL BOOK ,don't bother with those "" seriet ""  do and instead simply do all the bacs .**

Also if you're as lazy as I was then you can put genetique diploide wel evolution aside because they're never fel principal ( just a bit risky obviously ).

Hope it helps lol . Good luck !",2019-09-09 15:44:54
ezpnz7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/d1ryff/,3,"Bac chnowa ? I'm assuming Maths or Technique since you're asking about these three apparently minor subjects.

It depends on what your goal is, if it's just to pass the exam (10/20) you don't need to worry much about them, focus on your main subjects. If you want to pass with a good grade you should give them some of your time (but not much).

It also depends on how desperate you need help at those subjects, I know people who had extra courses for all of them so here's my personal expererience:

1) Philo: I absolutely sucked at it, and so did my teacher so I entered extra courses half way through the year. It was very useful to me as the teacher gave us exactly what we needed to know.

2) I was above average in SVT so I did not enter extra courses. If you find yourself needning help in them you have 2 options either enter a weekly extra course or wait for the end of the year and have some courses at that time (like 2 or 3). Also no worries 2nd and 3rd year SVT is barely relevant IIRC.

3) Info is honestly one of the easiest subjects of the Bac. Many people attend extra courses not because they struggle with it, but because they really want to get 19-20 in it. I was good at it naturally but Most of my class were having them.",2019-09-09 15:55:27

f0mflvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/d5h819/,3,"Well, whether people are excited about it depends on whether they like the candidates or not: some are excited and some are disappointed.

The two candidates are:
1) Nabil Karoui, he is a businessman and the owner of a tv channel Nessma. He is currently in jail for money laundering and tax evasion. He wasn't really present in the political landscape until few months ago, most Tunisians knew him mainly through his tv network where he launched a project to collect money and charities and help the needy. Some find it humiliating the way he makes poor people thank him in front of the camera and express their gratitude to him. 
In his electoral campaign, ecosocially he confirmed that fighting poverty is his number one priority. When it comes to national security, he said he aims to centralise all national security agencies into one single organism. And he wants to improve and strengthen relationships between countries of the Maghreb.

2) Kais Saied, is a well-known jurist and professor of constitutional law. He doesn't have any political experience and doesn't belong to any parties. In fact, his campaign is against the current system advocating a reform of the constitution and decentralisation of powers within the government. He is a conservative candidate who supports the death penalty and unequal inheritance, and he does not shy away from referencing the Quran and mentioning the Sharia. He also opposes political parties and think they're feeding illusions and lies to the people, and refused to receive government money to finance his campaign, his team was composed of less than 20 people and he preferred walking in the streets, talking to people in cafés rather than hosting big expensive events. 

Both candidates are controversial.
The political system in Tunisia is semi-presidential, the two main figures ruling are the president and the prime minister. The president is considered the head of state (whereas the pm is the head of the government), the commander in chief of armed forces.

f0odbuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/d5rosz/,3,"&gt; Does this mean electing karoui is going to have beneficial economic returns for Tunisia while having bad effects on laws? (new laws? old laws? or meaning he'll break the law?) 

The opposite.

He will have bad economic returns for Tunisia (at least in terms of standards of living) as he will most likely abuse his status for himself and his rich friends. (He will break the law.)

If he does that, his political opponents won't just look, right? They will probably try to attack him with scandals and such.

The easiest way to forget a scandal is with another scandal so I think he will push forward liberal laws (equal inheritance, homosexuality etc...)

This will probably work for him in the short term. I think he will use many tricks to stay president during his 5 years.

But it will have a few impacts on the population : 
Through that experience, I believe that people will villify him and no longer elect somebody because of how nice he appears to be. 

I also believe that every trick he will use during his election won't be useable against Tunisians anymore.

&gt; So we should elect an anti-hero besh ynikelhom wa3dhom akkeka yit3almou bil fal9a? nathrbouhom 5ater n7ebbouhom?

f1ux5ar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/daok38/,3,"Thank you too for at least discussing this! I really appreciate that

The president has as one of his roles appointing a lot of positions, and he said he wouldn't work with gays so that means he wouldn't choose someone gay (even if they were more qualified) which is discrimination and not freedom. Freedom means that Kais can be straight or gay and not having that effect his life or career in any way but it does not mean that he can discriminate between people just because of their sexual orientation

Moreover, this is an important issue and let me try and say why

They're still tunisian citizens, it makes no sense to mistreat them just because there aren't many of them (what does their number even matter for?)

Moreover legalising same sex civil unions was shown to improve innovation (when comparing number of patents in states in the USA that did it vs those that didn't) and that even controlling for other variables

And it'll be a step in the right direction of equality and rule of law. Which both are extremely important things to have in society, Lee kuan yew of singapore said that Rule of law and stability are the most important things to have, he brought his country from developing to the first world in a single generation, why can't we learn from other people?",2019-09-29 13:44:34

Moreover no one is saying to force it on anyone (literally no one is asking for this)

Even then, rule of law and stability are extremely important for countries (as said by lee kuan yew the dude that made singapore into a first world country in a single generation)

Social tensions (caused by minorities being mistreated) works directly against stability, it even negatively effects innovation.

You can't have a strong rule of law without equality, and here again caring for minorities (among other things) is very important",2019-09-29 13:52:40

&amp;nbsp;

The history of ""lack of international payment method"" is a bit more complex than that, what you are saying was true during the Ben Ali era, but that was mainly to force any new innovation business to ""split with the family"".

&amp;nbsp;

After the revolution the issue is purely economical, the country **cannot** allow every idiot to waste our foreign currency reserves in online gambling and sex video chat, and i myself, as a citizen who pays +10.000Tnd/year in taxes, wouldn't like it either, 
and guess what ? i do have access to International payment method, my bank (and any private bank) will give you access to that as long as your business is bringing you foreign money (USD/Euro), they give you international credit card, that you can use anywhere you want (i still prefer payoneer though)

I wont go much into details but [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GutGD0yqgtg) explains the current situation perfectly, believe me, there is no conspiracy and no one in the government gives two shit about a couple of young men trying to get into dropshipping, and that is the main issue.

&amp;nbsp;

The government don't care, they still don't understand the real benefits of a something like this, in ~2013, when the tech minister introduced ""la carte technologique"", that man (Noomane fehri) is a tech guy and he knew exactly what he was doing, alongside that card he tried to make programming boot-camps all across the country, and when the card got launched what did people used for ? 

buying scrap shit from Ali-express, i only know few persons that used it for its sole purpose, which is paying service fees for tech platforms (google play, Apple app store, Unity, etc..) 

&amp;nbsp;

I'll tell you the truth mate and i hope you don't get mad, 

only incompetent lazy idiots wouldn't find a way to international payment, i am a programmer who's been working exclusively online since 2013 and i found a way around sending and receiving money **legally** (Payoneer, Skrill, Moneytrans, worldremit, just to name few services) and i currently make ~20k/month, i know other people who's been doing dropshipping for years and they ended up opening companies in Hong Kong because for that sort of business its much better than Tunisia.


&amp;nbsp;

So yeah, i agree that in the best scenario, it would be dope that we just had access to things like this without any hustle, and that we didn't have such a lame and slow bureaucracy that makes you wait up to a month in order to start a simple company and legitimize your business

but we don't, 

why ?

&amp;nbsp;



Cause our politicians are a bunch of old-fashioned idiots.

And our youths are a bunch of whiny, lazy, conspiracy-lovers cry babies.

f2ayxyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/dcoxiq/,3,"I honestly think the problem is in our legislators, they lack “programmers and developers” (I’ll tell you what I mean by that, when you write a program, that asks the user to enter some info, something like a credit card number, you have to make your program robust against absurd situations, for example what if the user types a curse word instead of the credit card number, you have to think of every micro possible situation and cover it, so that when it happens, your program can handle) because our laws don’t cover absurd situations, for example, the locked up president situation, and if he wins they’re all planning on treating it like a hot potato, everyone will throw the responsibility to the next person (they already said they’ll do that), and look at the institutions that protect the American people, for example this agency that helped detect these transactions, I think it’s called The foreign agents registration act of the department of justice, we need those agency.

I think we should all become a copy of Kais Said and start to respect  the rule of the law and that's the first key of prosperity.

f2fzkc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/ddbrtc/,3,"I didn’t mean to make it seem like I was judging you. The unstated assumption is that Tunisia and Turkey share a history of secularism and French-inspired laïcité. 

You say it doesn’t work like that, but in Turkey, though, it traditionally did work like that—the secular elite worked to keep religious people out of education. Women in headscarf were banned from universities, teaching in schools, and the bureaucracy. Many professional associations would serve alcohol and you’d raise suspicion if you never drank. (This was especially true, I’m told, in the army.) The religious parties went through three phases in Turkey. First, in the 1970’s, it was a small party of the small portion of middle class and upper-middle class that was religious. In the 80’s, they swung to the left economically, and so started succeeding with people who were “traditional”, who were born in villages but now lived in big cities but were kept out of power by the secular elite (keep in mind, every 5 years or so, the religious party would be banned and they’d rebrand). In the 90’s, they started winning mayoralties (Erdoğan won Istanbul in 1994) and then by 2002 they’d pushed their economic platform to the right (supporting big business and free trade) and dropped a lot of the pro-Shariah items from their platform (making them more like European Conservatives than classical Islamists) so they kept their support with poor recent migrants but also won the support of most of the previous right wing parties (and those parties’ voters who were ardently secular eventually switched to the left wing party but it’s an awkward fit). 

In Egypt, on the other hand, when there was no democracy, you could see the Muslim Brotherhood’s strength in how they organized educated people. They were very active in universities (sometimes even, I’m told, organizing students to sit in gender-separated rows in the classroom). They were very active in professional association, in the Bar Association, the Egyptian Medical Association, etc. 

I’m curious what it was like in Tunisia to be an Ennahda supporter, and whether you’ve felt excluded because of it. One of my Turkish friends, for instance, when she visits my wealthy, secular neighborhood, she’ll point out that she’s the only one around in a headscarf (she lives in a wealthy, religious neighborhood). She definitely knew she was a minority when she was at Boğaziçi for her undergrad (it’s generally seen as the best school in the country). Politically, she knows the AKP is corrupt, but she (rightfully) feels like most of the other hate parties her for wearing hijab so can’t imagine voting for them.",2019-10-04 21:32:25
f2g78ff,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/ddctoo/,3,"Yep, but I’m too insecure (is probably the main reason), and I have a lot of health problems, but honestly not just to run for office, it’s about being active, just to put it out there with a YouTube channel or start a Tunisian podcast, if it attracts people great, if it doesn’t, well at least you’re not left with the feeling of “I could’ve done something maybe”. Also what’s motivating is that the Tunisian parties don’t cover all the political spectrum (they’re mainly left wing parties), so there’s a lot of spots to cover, it’s an empty scene, it would really help if that void gets filled. (I know that countries that have right wingers and left wingers, they tend to despise each other, but IMO, I honestly believe that they balance things out. Countries that fall into chaos, is usually due to a side overwhelming another, so, i think they should appreciate each other, as a side pulls for empathy, and the other for order and industriousness).",2019-10-04 22:14:32

you go there and they‘ll talk to you and ask you some questions like why are you going ? or do you have any familiy there? (having someone there would help) -
and based on your answers and your language skills they would give you the visa sooner or later (you can get it the in same day, that depends on the embassy i guess) and it’s certainly not hard to get -
then you book a flight from a travel agency and that‘s it ..

About the 5th point: I personally don't believe we should gratify presidents or leaders any more than what their actions show us. So no, they aren't getting any of those benefits unless they deserve them which makes the idea , of making it a priori, null.

f3qw29w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/dhra98/,3,"1) Very undemocratic.    
People with private property have different political interests than people without private property.    
It will create a society in which, more than now, people with money and private property will rule, and create a state in which the rights of the non owing class will be stripped.    

2) I don't care tbh   

3) Sure why not. Also make legal limits on sugar in food, and start growing hemp or medical cannabis which you can provide to Europe. It creates a ton of fucking job, foreign currency and is the fastest growing market worldwide.    

4) Sure why not. I don't think too many normal people would be interested in that and come to Tunisia solely for that. But you could still get a bunch of jews from around the world. Also it would be the perfect bases of getting better a relationship with Israel. If you like that. And don't care about their government policies or Palestine.   

5) No. Why? Either you create an UBI for all citizens or you don't do it at all. There shouldn't be career politicians or a bureaucratic class which uses the state for their profit while the population is suffering.   

6) Why? So that the citizen has less representation in the parliament? Also don't give them a salary for 2 years but for 6 months.   
 
7) It might not be the best idea, while Tunisia is somewhat weak economically, to open up the country for foreign investment. Especially if you don't have rules to protect national assets and industry.    
Also its not important for your country to have a high ranking on free market business rankings, which are made by foreign capitalists who want to conquer the market. Its more important to have a functioning system, with the least suffering which is possible.    

8) For new car sales? Sure why not     

9) Sure why not. Maybe make it a week for the people and everybody in school has to go there at least once, with their class.",2019-10-14 19:35:23

you're a miserable cunt.

Over the years  other Muslim countries, other arab countries and our direct neighbors Algeria and Libya helped us and we helped them because we share so may common things together. 

We helped the Algerians when they got invaded by France in the 1830s and later after 1956 for their liberation fight. Libya helped us when we got invaded by the French in 1881 and a number of Tunisians fled to Libya. We returned the favor in 2011 when Gaddafi was about to annihilate his people. Pakistan, Indonesia, Egypt, Iraq and Syria all helped us in the 1950 with shelter, weapons and diplomatic cover against the French.

Simply because all he did was sack ministers and put temporary replacements from within the government in their place. He can't name people from outside the government as ministers because that would require the parliament to assemble and vote for them, which is currently not possible.

So it begs the question why would he sack these ministers if the replacements would not be his top choice? It means that they did, are doing or are going to do something that he doesn't like and he had to expel them in an expeditious manner. And that's the reason for all the fuss.

The explanation that was forwarded and that I see as the closest to what actually happened is that these two ministers were not playing ball with the PM. The PM wants them gone. He can't fire them without running it by the president, and the president doesn't want discord within the government for God knows how many months. D'où on a ça.",2019-10-30 18:47:59

Find your own path, no one here will tell you what that path will be. Run, jump, dance, listen to/make music, watch videos or movies, do drugs, spend your nights contemplating about your life..or anything mentioned above. You and only you can find that path (some go to say your path is always there and this lifetime should be spent on trying to find that path).
There's a TV show i highly recommend which is True Detective (season 1). The main character Rust Cohle discussed one idea in particular which says that the fact humans can contemplate on their existence is kind of their main design flow as creatures as well as their major strength. The fact you're ""openly"" discussing your state of mind means you made the first and the most difficult step. Now it's up to you to walk your path.

Tunisia isn't 100% amazigh because they were forced to abandon their culture, not because they simply felt that it's useless, i mean come on, why would someone abandon his culture so he can convert to a religion ? it doesn't make any sense, are Muslims Turks Arabs now ? or how about Persians, Indians, Chinese, German, Slavic, Albanian, African etc... you get the point so religion isn't the reason
They were forced to abandon their culture during the Roman era, Vandal era, Fatimid era (they even started a huge campaign to settle plenty of Arab tribes in order to eliminate the Amazigh blood and change the demographics, meaning an ethnic cleansing but it's not the first nor the last), French era and currently the government have policies that are anti-amazigh, like how they banned the use of the language, a Pharmacy owner wanted to make an amazigh and arabic sign for his Pharmacy and so he got arrested and his Pharmacy closed, so yeah, Amazigh are still being oppressed

As for the last line, nope, they co existed with the Carthaginians then betrayed them for the Romans and after that the Romans betrayed them and conquered the whole North African region, read history dude, don't make up baseless claims just because you have some kind of hatred for the amazighs

And you know what, Amazighs are a great people and without them, many great achievements in history wouldn't have happened, without them, Arabs would have never reached Iberia and France and conquered them, in fact, the reason for the loss of that region is because of racism, without Amazighs, Tunisia would have been an Italian or Spanish or even French colony to this day, the Amazigh Hafsid kingdom protected Tunisia for long time, and again, Amazighs once ruled Roman empire and even ancient Egypt and made a big mark on history

It might also reinforce their own faith and make them more attached to their religion.. We don't know.

f792jeq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/durjj1/,3,"There has already been good advice given here. I'll just confirm a few things and add some stuff.

My friend, I completely understand that right now everything looks bleak and hopeless, but trust me, it does get better. Suicidal thoughts, anxiety and depression are the worst. But, you can get better. Get professional help. It really makes a great impact on your mental well being. 5 years ago I was a depressed anxious bipolar suicidal dysfunctional individual who could only think about death 24/7. But right now, even though I still struggle every once in a while, I get to enjoy the simple things in life again, I have hope for the future. I feel \*alive\* again. It was all thanks to therapy and (in my case) medication. Things improve a lot. This pain and hopelessness you're feeling can go away.

Dropping out of school won't solve your inner turmoil. Because the problem is deeper than that. You need to address things at their core. If there are stressors and triggering factors in your environment (school, family, friends...), avoid them. You can take a gap year if you think it would help you rest psychologically. But don't discard all of your education. Because, honestly nowadays, even doing minimum-wage jobs requires a high school diploma, unless you have a trade or a talent for menial jobs. But for computer stuff, as you mention you like them, the minimum is high school math, and preferably a bachelor's degree/licence. You can do freelance without a university degree, but you'll have to pass a lot of online certifications to ""prove"" to employers your skills, and tbh in Tunisia we are still behind in this. And either way, I don't believe socially isolating yourself would help your mental health right now. Even during the gap year, if you take one, don't stay at home. It's important for human psychology to feel achievement. The dopamine we get after achieving something can counterbalance the depression, to some extent at least. So, go out, have fun with friends, go travel, go see the nature, visit a zoo, go to the cinema, contemplate the small things around us. Do physical activity as well, get in a gym, go for walks, play football, etc. And try to have a healthy diet as well, not ""regime"" or anything, just avoid the excess of junk food. And surround yourself with positive energy and vibes. Positive people, positive scenery, animals...

If you have a few people around you that you completely trust and think would listen to you with no judgement (which is a sad reality in Tunisia), confide to them. It is important for people struggling with mental health issues to have a good and solid support network. 

And I say it again, go consult a psychiatrist. It's important. He can be a life saver. Also, I advise against seeing a psychologist (""psychologue"") first, in Tunisia they usually lack the necessary clinical knowledge in their curriculum, unfortunately. I myself had a bad experience with one, and many of my friends had similar things happen to them, from wrong diagnosis to uncaring therapists. I advise you to go a psychiatrist(""psychiatre""), because they have medical background as well, so they would know first and foremost to eliminate other diagnosis that may be caused by physiological, endocrinological or neural illnesses rather than psychological ones, and also they can give medication if necessary. Plus a simple therapist would probably refer you to a psychiatrist in cases of suicidal thoughts and severe depression anyways. And I advise you to see a doctor in the public sector not private practive. Yes, even though they say our hospitals are bad, etc. I do believe our psychiatrists are great. I was a medical student in the past, and when comparing them to other specialties' doctors, I noticed most of them are way more empathetic with the patients. Besides, a psychiatrist in the private sector might be rushing the session to get more clients (and more money), although it depends on the doctor himself. I have heard of a few good private practitioners. There is a good one in Bardo.

Also, try to self-reflect to understand what is causing this depression. If it is school studies, maybe you are not satisfied with the ""section"" you chose/are gonna choose? Maybe you are overworking and overexherting yourself with work? Maybe it is family putting too much stress on you? Maybe you try to live up to too many expectations? Maybe some ""friends"" are bullying you? Or you have some toxic people around? Maybe some family issues you have at home? Maybe the tension between some family members (parents, siblings) is affecting you badly? Maybe you have some goals you want to achieve deep down and you have been ignoring it for a while? Try to notice what is wrong or lacking in your life, and try to work towards improving it. Notice the patterns that keep repeating themselves foretelling each episode, the triggers that keep inciting such thoughts. Everything can be achieved. Step by step. Don't stress yourself. Life is a journey. These things may take years. It's okay if now you don't have a clear vision for the future, you're still young, you have a lot of years ahead of you, hopefully bright years. You have a great potential. Try to use it. And take care of yourself. Don't forget yourself during the pursuit of life. Your soul needs nurturing, so feed it, just like you feed your body with food, and feed your mind with knowledge. Your soul needs rest from time to time too. To recover from the stress, the fast-paced life, and the harships. Try to heal the old scars that you have and might have overlooked. This is a process that a professional can help you with.

Don't be afraid, everything will be alright. It'll work out in the end. Just hold on with your dear life and cling to this thread called life. You deserve it. I know it feels hard. I know you're suffering. I know it seems like there's no end to this dark tunnel. But there is. There are people who love you. Who care. We are waiting for you at the other end, where the light is. Just keep moving, step by step. Take it easy on yourself. You'll arrive eventually. You'll find your happiness soon. You deserve to be happy and fullfilled. And you can do it. I know you can. You're brave, and strong. For you have resisted all those dark thoughts on your own. Nothing can take you down. You're a fighter. You just have a few more steps until you reach your goal. So keep doing your best, and things will get better, I promise you. I speak as someone who went through what you are going through right now.

I hope you will be well soon. And be safe.",2019-11-11 19:48:30

He did not build an economic foundation, something we still suffer from today. He coudnt handle money at all even in private, there are a lot of stories about that. Furthermore he let a corrupt fool like ben Ali replace him with a coup because he didnt think of tunisia after his death to give someone after him the power that has at least a gram patriotism in his blood. If you talk to older people they think he was a political genius. Its difficult to argue with them.

Some people identify with a Berber identity, and many with both. The only problem is when someone tries to deny the identity of the other, as the other commentor did when he said that ""Tunisians are sometimes 'mistakingly' considered Arab"".

&gt;Didn't the French actually favour Berbers though?

I'm not actually sure about that, I'd like to look into it if you have any links? I was of the knowledge that Berbers were seen as pagans by some Arab and Ottoman Muslims, and by the time of French occupation, weren't the majority of Berbers Muslim anyway? I'd have assumed if anything that the French might have favoured the Jewish and Christian Tunisians, of which there were many at the time. 
 I'm reading a paper at the minute called Privilege and Power in Colonized North Africa (should be first result if you Google) that basically deals with how certain groups were favoured by the ruling classes of the time. As for the French, I haven't heard of them favouring the Berbers per se but the notable Berber diaspora in France might be testament to some kind of favourable treatment. 

When I said 
&gt;I believe this is the result of the Berber identity being purged by French colonialists

I should have added that I also believe the Arab identity was purged by French colonialists, which is also why I think part of the reason many Tunisians and North Africans identify so strongly with being Arab, is because it helped to unite and empower us in the face and wake of oppression. Also I think a lot of Muslims from all backgrounds have this romantic idea that Arabs are some kind of chosen people, which is why you even get some Punjabi South East Asians claiming Arab identity. But in regards to the purging of both identities by the French, I think France didn't really want either groups getting any kind of foothold, they wanted French to be the primary language and French culture to be chosen over Arab and Berber, without affording us the same rights. 

&gt;he saw that many of the tribes in Eastern Algeria (including my family which is originally from Algeria) were Arab

That's interesting but makes sense to be honest, you have to remember there were two serious waves of Arab migration to the Maghreb, first with Uqba ibn Nafi in 670CE and then the second wave later on during the middle ages if I'm not mistaken. Arabs have been in NA for a long time so there will be large established populations, and best believe the Arabs and the Berbers and the Iberians (not so much the Turks and French, apart from soldiers raping locals) all had babies with eachother, Tunisia has been cosmopolitan since the time of Jesus, when we talk DNA, it is impossible to say ""I am 100% Arab"" or ""I am 100% Imazighi"", because I'm sure you will struggle to find that kind of homogeny in our country.

My fathers side is also originally Algerian but Amazigh from Kabylie, but he identifies as French if anything and doesn't care for being either Arab or Berber, he grew up in France but even to this day I don't think he really understands exactly who Berber people are, that kind of sentiment is quite common with that generation in my family (post-independence), they tend to acknowledge the fact that they have Berber ancestry but they view themselves as Arab. I think the rise in pan-Arabism started in the late nineteenth/early twentieth century, then resurfaced again during the mid twentieth century, following independence from colonial powers and the establishment of Israel. The British and French really screwed the ME &amp; NA, and so I think many just united under the banner of a pan-Arab identity.

I exaggerated when I said most to be honest, the main source I'm referring to is the same one as you. Arabised is a pretty modern term in human geography, mainly denoting regions that were not originally Arab but whose cultures and language have adopted an Arab identity. I've also actually seen some articles saying Algeria and Morocco are 70-90% Arab-Berber, respectively, whilst saying Tunisia is 98% Arab, but Tunisian stats aren't the most accessible and the sources weren't so reliable so I take everything with a grain of salt. On the other hand, the Wikipedia article on Arab-Berbers says that Tunisia is 99% Arab-Berber, and references BBC News and CIA World Factbook, funnily enough that article uses the term 'arabization' in reference to the Maghreb.

It seems like 'Maghrebi' or Arab Berber is a pretty good middle ground when discussing our people, too Arab to be purely Berber but still unique from other Arabs. I took a DNA test (not always reliable) out of interest but it just confirmed what I already knew, mainly North African with Levantine, Anatolian, Iberian, West African and a little Scandinavian.. Interestingly, the Vikings did settle in Tunisia in the eleventh century, I think that's possibly why we have a lot of red headed, freckled Tunisians maybe? My cousin also told me once that in Bizerte, some Russians mixed with the locals in the twentieth century and that there's a lot of blue eyes, blonde haired Tunisians there. I've only been to Bizerte once and I can't remember what the people looked like so I'm just speculating as to whether that's true or not.",2019-12-02 21:12:03

- tourism, you can mention djerba, soussa, hamamet

- don't you dare forget carthage : the best empire on earth untill romans won. And don't forget hannibal who was a great strategist and influenced romans and even Napoleon

- mention the rich hsitory of basically most great empires being there as having tunisia and south italy meant control of mediterranian sea. So most empire fought over controlling tunisia. So basically there are some roman monuments, arab monuments, carthage, etc.

- you can mention some foods aswell. Tajin is not the same in Tunisia as in Morocco despite having the same name. There are a couple of nice things like that. And if you speak about food, harissa is not to be forgotten : the thing we put in everything we cool. (Even sandwiches)",2019-12-10 00:03:32

There are quite a few reputable artists in the affluent parts of Tunis. I know quite a lot of people who got theirs done on the cheap in Tunisia and honestly they look awful, the colours faded, the art is really bad and sometimes even looks like it's infected, I would NEVER EVER EVER EVER IN A MILLION YEARS go to a tattoo artist who wasn't reputable or licensed, let alone some shady guy in Tunisia doing tattoos with a sewing needle. 

 I would avoid the less well known ones like the plague, and ESPECIALLY prison tattooers, you don't know if they have cleaned their equipment properly or even if they know what they're doing. Do you really want to risk HIV, Hepatitis, gangrene etc because you wanted to save money on a tattoo? Also tattoos are for life, so why would you not want the absolute best right? 

Probably avoid tattoo shops anywhere but Tunis tbh but I may be wrong. I know of some in Sousse but they look really dirty and like you could get an infection. If I were you I would save up and find a reputable artist in the capital OR save up and go to a licensed artist in Europe if possible, OR go traditional and ask an Imaizghi woman to do it for you lol",2019-12-11 18:15:47

Dimassi was an old school leftist, a syndicalist, so the solutions he proposed weren’t economic freedom, privatization, open markets, free trades, less taxes, no. It was more state reach, in everything, cut out all unnecessary imports, refuse all loans from the FMI, stop salary raises, stop recrutements, and give out food stamps for people who needs them, confront Tunisians with a sudden change in their lifestyles. He wondered, isnt this what you all want? A better future for your kids? Obviously no, the people want to live exactly as they live now, and the elected government wants reelection. You said predict, my opinion is that we will stay in this cycle for a while, elected officials will try not to change anything to preserve the lifestyle they got elected during it so that they maximize their chances of being reelected, as Nahdha did was Dimassi? Don’t you think that Nahdha did what’s the best for Nahdha in all this? Think of how much gains it made since then? Imagine where Nahdha would be if it listened to Dimassi?

It's not the individual who is accountable for the failures of the state especially in our own case where the state owns the individual and the state is entitled to the individual's money and labor.

Now to address your first argument that 10% tops are uncivil and anti freedom with a counter argument. Things have been going on in a terrible way since the pre colonial era. We have almost the same issues as they had then. ( A corrupt ruling class, intellectual void, poverty, monopolies of entire sections of the economy by a few, no class mobility, forgotten and rotten regions....) And yet people are in a hobbsian state of mind where most of them agree that the Beys, France, Bourguiba, Ben Ali are better then nothing. And we should set low standards for our rulers for the sake of SAFETY not freedom and not wealth SAFETY. 

For your second argument which is the jobs are hard. Dude that's an oversimplification and trying to make something so complicated absurd.

It's expected that you associate them. But magic and sorcery are very ancient. They were there when people believed in ancient gods, pagan gods etc..and weirdly they were always used and associated with the evil forces of that time.

In Greek times they even had a goddess of magic !! Hekate. She would assist human sorcerers in their evil endeavours and was known to release evil creatures at night.",2019-03-17 11:01:14

 I didnt saw an 'act of magic' since i defenitely dont believe in that but i saw somebody who was trying to do it. Recently in my highschool a random woman with a very particular dressing style (a lot of chrok w braceleyet w charka around her head) came claiming to be an ancient student, she started doing weird signs with her fingers on the wall, she spilled a weird liquid near el 3alam and said to some students ""el lycee edheya habs wena bch n7aterkom menou"". The next day she came back and she wrote something on the mirror of the girls bathroom and then she wiped it off.

eiq4zfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/b1vvwx/,2,"Actually I don't agree with you. A part from Harry Potter and other pop culture, using magic was not seen as good. Religions fought against it and made it illegal. 
To cure a disease through magic was just how people made a living, giving herbs and other stuff and it always came with a price. Means even if the intentions were good, using magic to do good stuff was seen as bad.
For evil spirits you probably heard of exorcism and it was always a religious entity who came to deliver a person from the evil. Not using magic but the word of God.

But we never heard of someone performing magic/sorcery to stop hunger or fight poverty, in the history it was always personal gain, power and money or in this case to protect yourself from the magic and evil.

The simple fact that you need to protect yourself from it, makes it evil.

I never check a bag going there. Here is what you can do if you want to take gifts. Do you know how to sew? Sew a dress or coat with big pockets. Put your heavy gifts into those pockets. None of the airlines weigh people nor do they have a rule about what you are allowed to have in your pockets as long as it is not something like liquids or knives that is restricted. 

My SO and I always travel to Europe with only one personal item bag. You have to just get used to surviving without much clothing. I went to Tunisia for a month using only one personal item bag (no extra carry on and no checked bag). I brought dark clothes that I could rewear. I brought my favorite laundry detergent as my only liquids so that I could constantly hand wash and hang clothes every night. Every night, I washed whatever undergarments, socks, and shirt I wore that day. I alternated clothes every other day so they had a day to dry. Things dry very fast in Tunisia. And I alternated every few days washing items that did not have to be washed as often.

You can also bring a few clothes that you don't like so that you can throw them away or leave them behind and then you will have a little extra room to bring a couple things back. I made enough room to bring a few books back from Paris.

ek4nm2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/b9fxb4/,2,"If you don't mind me giving you one piece of advice if you haven't been to Tunisia before....

Bring your own roll of toilet paper and take some with you everywhere. You are going to need it. It will save you the trouble and embarrassment of requesting it from people when you find it isn't there in the bathroom. Or worse, save you from being made to pay for it places where it isn't provided for free.

Also, if you use the bathroom at the airport, the bathroom attendant will try to bully you into tipping her. Do not tip her. It is just another example of the national habit of trying to take advantage of tourists. The toilet paper she will try to hand you wasn't bought by her. It is provided by the airport but she will try to guilt you into tipping her because she gives you some of the airport's toilet paper. Remember that like half of your airplane fare was paid to the airports themselves and the governments. The least they can do is giving 5 cents worth of toilet paper without their attendants trying to force a tip out of you.

When I use the airport bathroom there, I walk right by the attendant and refuse her toilet paper. I have my own. And I walk right by her on the way out without tipping her and I just ignore her ridiculous dirty look that she tries to intimidate me with.

Please don't encourage this predatory and bad behavior on their parts by giving in to their intimidation. If you feel sorry for them, well, maybe you should feel sorry for your husband instead. Isn't he working very hard to provide for your family? Don't throw his money away on con artists and beggars. Take a good look at those women.

There are just too many of them. And if you bring gifts then there is always somebody else who could have gotten one who isn't happy they didn't and people are never satisfied enough with what they got. So I just stopped. When they asked for their gifts this time, I told them I'm sorry but we are very strapped for cash right now and I had to fly a budget airline and the budget price did not allow me a checked bag or a carry on bag. I only brought one personal item bag for my entire trip and couldn't even bring things I needed so I could be comfortable myself. And that was that. 

What I brought in the past were like things on request. Specialty items for cooking and such.

You know they have chocolate there! What they don't have that I think is really special is real vanilla. Nearly impossible to find there. I never found it. Maybe I needed to go to a special store in the capitol. Vanilla is expensive so don't bring for everybody. But if somebody there has been especially good to you then maybe for them. Most of them don't really cook things like cake and cookies so I'm not sure they would even know what to do with it. I made a cake there once and cookies for them. Also I brought marshmellows and rice crispies one trip and made rice krispy treats. I had to hunt for real butter at one of the bigger markets. They tend to use margarine because it is cheap. Gross. By the way, the ""honey"" in the stores is all fake stuff from China that is dyed and mixed with sugar water. You can get real honey there from people who have their own hives. People in the villages usually know somebody who will sell you some honey.

But on the contrary of the sixties to the early eighties French is no longer the tool to master knowledge but just a foreign language. So til the conclusion of junior high school classes Arabic is now the main language.

Yet in high school years courses like maths and physics ... are still taught in French to a generation unable to understand it.  (This is due to teachers who are unqualified in French because of among other reasons)

This leaded to some tragicomic situations like what recently happened to thousands of candidates to high school final diploma (preceding the access to university) who failed to resolve a major question in the chemistry exam just because they didn’t understand the meaning of the french pronoun « auxquels » written in the text (that is the English which) asserting that never before they have heard of such a chemical body.

Our country of course has issues but the issue you brought is the last of our problems.

Second, your argument would make sense if you implied that people automatically are not proficient at any language that isn't their first. That's absolutely not true, mastering multiple languages is very possible and I don't need to provide exemples to you. By the time students study scientific courses in french they already studied that language for at least 7 years. That's a lot of time.

Third, you are ignoring the context when it comes to the language in Tunisia. Should they be taught in arabic, it would be in fusha. But most ppl's mother tongue is the derja, and the tunisian dialect is much much more different than standard arabic compared to levantine dialects, those are closer to it. if you were worrying that students wouldn't fully understand the courses because of the language, teaching it in fusha doesn't help.

And last, Tunisia has been a multicultural country from ancient times. Foreign languages proficiency is nowadays praised and encouraged.

You can buy a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables fairly cheaply over there but it is never organic or at least never differentiated by that. If you are in Europe, they call organic food ""bio"". I'm not sure what they call it in Tunisia. Most of them won't even understand what you are asking about. If anything is organic there it is by accident and not design. I had to educate pretty much anybody there that I talked to about hydrogenated oil product like margarine. Many of them don't have any concept about these things being bad for you.

If you see anything in a souk or other place where you have to haggle that you like, do not express interest in it. See if you can get a picture surreptitiously when the merchant is not looking. Or try to remember a very good description of it. Or have a system set up where you would point at it when he isn't looking to somebody who is shadowing you but who isn't obviously with you. If they see you snapping a picture, most of them will yell at you or try to demand compensation, which they have no right to. But they will try to threaten you. The picture is so that you can leave and show the picture to somebody who is Tunisian like your husband. Ask them to go in without you to buy the item for you and then you can pay them back. If the merchant knows the item is for an American, he will try to rip you off and charge you two, three, four, or more times what he would charge a Tunisian. So it is important that the merchants not know what items you are interested in. They are very foxy about watching your interest so they can use that information against you. Never show what your real interests are in their store.

I bought a couple of nice items by doing that. I went in, looked at everything as though I had no particular interest. Got a couple pictures. Then I left, showed them to somebody waiting around the corner. Then she went in and bought it for me. If they would have known it was for me, I would have paid double or more.

If the merchant sees them with you, then they try to buy something, he will know it is for a foreigner and won't give them a good price so be careful that he doesn't know the buyer is associated with you. This is more so a problem if you are buying clothing or jewelry not so much for food stuffs. I mean they might still overcharge you for food if you shop by yourself but they won't overcharge somebody else who is shopping and you just happen to be with them. Basically, if you buy a necklace, you will get robbed. Stuff like that. Half their economy is based on raping the tourists. Then they wonder why tourism is down. I would rather go to Paris where the price is the same for everybody and I'm not being ripped off just for being a foreigner. This last trip, I never even bought a single thing besides food my entire trip because I hate the way they are always trying to rip me off. If they just clearly marked their prices and charged everyone the same, I would buy things to bring home. But because I feel like they are always trying to prey on me and charge me extra, I refuse to even look at their stuff. When I walk by their stalls on my way somewhere, I ignore all the merchants who call out to me. I am thinking, F U, what, walk in your store so you can treat me like a fool and try to get me to pay ten times what you would ask a Tunisia to pay? Go to Hell. They actually lose money with this way of doing business I think. But they feel like they came out ahead when they overcharge one person and they don't see all the sales they are losing from people who are don't like this system.

By the way, the exchange rate is much better right now than it was any prior years. I think it was 1 to 3 last month when I visited. Most years it was nearly 1 to 1 or in that range. So that is good for you. They won't admit it but it is because of the collapse of their tourism. After the terrorist attacks there, tourism slowed to a near stop from countries like Great Britain. Those tourists have been replaced by tourists from poor countries like Russia. Those tourists don't spend as much money. Nobody there will admit any of this and will keep insisting that tourism has recovered. It hasn't.",2019-04-06 20:29:57
ek9rk8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/b9fxb4/,2,"I was talking about the person who wrote in Arabic, not about your husband. (Is that what you meant?)

Yes, I insist on using my own plate as well. They have just decided it is my weird idiosyncracy and give me one. They also think it is weird when I want a spoon or fork sometimes when they are just using bread to get the food. Of course they use spoons and forks too sometimes but some foods they scoop up with bread instead which I don't do. I really don't like to eat that much bread especially when I don't know what fat was used to cook it because I don't eat hydrogenated oil. So I always use a utensil and they think that is a bit odd or high maintenance or something. I don't care. 

You could easily hand sew some pocket onto a dress or skirt or into the inside or outside of a coat. Just cut out some squares of fabric and whip stitch them onto the skirt or coat. It doesn't have to look great. Just so it is functional and won't rip out. If I were in your area, I would sew them on for you with my machine. ",2019-04-06 20:48:34

As for your plan I don't know if you keep the right to study in Germany in (2020/2021)as a student from the tunisian government) if you succeed this year and decide to learn your german in Tunisia during (2019/2020). Be sure that this opportunity will remain otherwise???

Now onto our extremely exotic political class : When excluding the ~~islamists~~  democratic muslims and the ~~RCD1.1/1.2~~  Tahya/Nida Tounes parties you're left with these interesting groups :

* Popular front : This is afaik the 4th largest one . It's basically an alliance of left wing parties. It's most used slogan / call is demanding for the resignation of the goverment ( Doesn't matter if it was a 10 days old one or if there was some kind of progress ) . It also uses Brahmi/Belaid's deaths as a channeling tool to get as much votes as they can . They also have an obsession with destroying the Ennahdha movement and accuse them of being behind the assassinations . Their spokesman is Hamma Hammami .
* Courant démocrate : This one is basically the machrouu tounes of  [Congrès pour la République](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congr%C3%A8s_pour_la_R%C3%A9publique) . It was created by the abbou couple and has 3 seats in the current parliament . Their recent extraordinary congress ended with the party choosing Mouhamed abbou as their candidat for the presidential elections , a rather stupid choice considering his wife would have a really high chance of winning the presidency thanks to her high rating thanks to usually confronting ministers at hearing sessions and almost always accusing them of being corrupt ( exemple :Evidence is from Edunet if it's the minister of eduction she's addressing ) . They have a good relationship with the popular front and together seem to be notorious for using foul language in parliament, as well as generally being uncivilised.
* Al Badil Ettounsi: This so called liberal party was created by the previous head of goverment Mehdi Jomaa . He was minister of industry before that and is somewhat smarter than the other post revolution heads of government . Watching his campaign speeches and rallies truly makes you feel like it's happening somewhere in the US with Macron on the stage ( To help you understand what you just  read I suggest watching this short impressive montage   [https://www.facebook.com/M.mehdi.jomaa/videos/361976544418556/UzpfSTg4ODUwMjEyNDYzNDA3MzoxNDQyODg2MDA5MTk1Njc5/](https://www.facebook.com/M.mehdi.jomaa/videos/361976544418556/UzpfSTg4ODUwMjEyNDYzNDA3MzoxNDQyODg2MDA5MTk1Njc5/) ) .
* Parti destourien libre : This is essentially a group of ex RCD members that chose to openly express their fondness of the old regime after cautiously waiting out the mess that was the first few years after the revolution . They apparently think the average Tunisian is nostalgic of the Ben Ali era and absolutely hates Ennahdha . Their leader Abir Moussi is even more fun to read about ,  this woman behaves like she just came down from a tree. It's difficult to say what's worse about this person- the fact that she is ready to worship any dictator but is pro democracy or that she considers the martyrs of the revolution to be a bunch of stupid people ( Picture this : Lepen saying the french revolution was worthless and every civilian that died in it was dumb )  . This 1,sth meter tall gorilla with no manners would likely not have any chance of getting even an office job in any civilised country, let alone become head of a fairly large party.  Their rallies usually end up with cops securing their exit from a very angry crowd .

Now this comment is getting long as fuck and I feel too lazy to comment on the rest of the political parties , but I'm sure y'all get the general idea.

Honorable mention : party of lwara9 ( advocating for the legalization of cannabis ) / Amal ( Yassine Ayari)",2019-05-01 18:50:14

Secondly, Tunisia lacks resources like you’ve been told here, yet it is a better country to live in according to any news outlet you can find than Morocco or Algeria or Libya, why is that? Tunisians don’t even realize they have better ethics and values, well they don’t even know that they have it the best in the African and Arab world, it is total randomness according to them, so you’re basically telling them here “hey you guys are actually on right track and doing great, y’all just need to elevate your morals and values even higher that’s all, there’s no secret ingredient we all been through, I mean ffs Tunisians, you did it yourselves, look at your country compare it to other countries.”, yet they tell you that you are oversimplifying, so the second thing you’ll notice, complete unawareness of our status among countries, and how we got here, and what elevates us and could elevate us, no clear path, even though we walk it. Oh also, as an American you’ll see this in us Tunisians, no accountability. I mean you probably started to touch on that here.",2019-05-03 01:23:04
emdf0y1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/bjf6vd/,2,"You really nailed it for me. This is exactly how I experience talking about politics or social issues with Tunisian people. When I have been there, everybody is always really shocked by my views on politics. They think I am really extremist and they are very shocked/offended that I own guns and that I vote based on keeping my gun rights. They can't understand it at all. As you said, I am much farther right than any Tunisian person that I know. 

And you are right that Tunisia is almost on the right track. It has more potential than the other Maghreb countries but the people can't make the change to go just a bit farther in the direction that they need to go in order to have more of what they want economically and probably socially.

I always try to give them suggestions but nobody there will listen to me. As an outsider looking in at them, what they should do seems very obvious but instead they prefer to spin their wheels about things which don't matter.

I mean for example, Tunisia is obsessed with making money off tourism. I try to tell them that they relied on this for too long and this is the wrong path but they won't listen. There was a time when Tunisia was a really charming country to visit. It wasn't full of cars and overcrowded. Many of the older people wore traditional clothes which looked very exotic and beautiful on them. The crafts sold in the souks were traditionally made by Tunisian artisans in the same way as their ancestors made things. 

But now, the tourist areas are overcrowded with millions of cars and too many people, too many new ugly construction. Everybody is wearing blue jeans or just basically normal Western clothes. The girls and women don't wear nice Tunisian made wool blankets on their heads anymore. Instead they are wearing ugly cloths that are copied like the women in the gulf countries. Even the clothing of the covered women is not traditional women's clothes but instead ugly cheap polyester mu mu and tents that are copied from the women in the Arabian gulf. All the tourist trinkets and souvenirs are mainly cheap, ugly, unauthentic garbage made in China. And the extremism is increased compared to decades before so there is an undercurrent feeling of not feeling safe there anymore. None of this is nice for tourism.

I keep making a suggestion that Tunisia focus on building a medical empire that will attract medical tourism but nobody in Tunisia will listen to me. They could use resources to build tourism hospitals and English websites that are user friendly to bring people to Tunisia from all over the world to have medical treatment. This is a better type of tourism that they can be proud of instead of robbing tourists by charging them four times the price for some ugly souvenir. Tunisia has some very good doctors but it is almost impossible to find them if you live overseas. The government could easily change with some competent website design and some intelligent people put in charge of creating this as an industry.

There is potential in Tunisia but the attitude and approach there has to change.",2019-05-03 01:47:21

emwsdgg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/bltkv4/,2,"You really don't need to worry about any specific clothing to wear, but situational awareness is key here. Anything goes at the hotel, cafe, or trendy bar... 

But going into popular neighbourhoods (which are also sometimes historic) you will get a few stares and catcalls if you're wearing short shorts or something like that.

This also depends on the city: For instance Djerba or Hammamet are Tourist towns and you can act and do whatever you do in your home country. 

Tunis is the capital city and like any capital city some places are dangerous when it gets dark and sreets are filled with ""thugs"" or street urchins. Some cities are like this.

Bothering tourists is an big, BIG (**HUGE**) no-no, and there is a ""Touristic Police"" tasked with protecting tourists and touristic areas. They are ""tough on crime"" to say the least. So the areas near resorts are usually devoid of street crime. Police in general will do anthing in their power to serve tourists.

Advice: Ask at the reception for a neighbourhood to explore if you're feeling independent. They will guide you towards tourist-friendly places. Careful around """"""guides"""""". If you need help/directions ask waiters instead. Guides may seem charming/friendly/charismatic but they either see you as a walking wallet or their passport out of here.

&amp;#x200B;

Your response suggests that you are either really naive (your advice is very basic, keep passport and money on you is 101 of being in a big city, you don't have to be a tourist to get your phone snatched at the metro in any capital, Paris mainly) and have really had a terrible time, which is fair enough, but there is no need to actively bash an entire country and its people based on it; or that you simply lack common sense as a tourist (ie expecting things to be exactly as they are ""back home"") and/or open-mindedness and empathy towards people who are completely different from you.

&amp;#x200B;

Suggestion to OP is to base their opinion on the general consensus which is that Tunisia is a beautiful country with lots to offer, but precautions should be taken, to avoid culture shock and to ensure you have a good time (ie, arrange your transport from your airport to your accomodation in advance, a service that is cheaply offered by many hotels/airbnbs etc; read about the place you're visiting; always ask what's in the food you're about to eat if concerned about allergies etc) and you will find that \*most\* people will be lovely, as in any other place around the world.",2019-05-13 13:58:13

Although it’s said that the fire was accidentally set by a cigarette or may be a power surge in a multi-batteries charger for portable hand held power tools (that keeps feeding all night long) I should guess that the final results will not be 100% convincing. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is due to the extremely tense political and social climate in France during which Notre Dame took fire. 

&amp;#x200B;

To my mind I do really believe that a fire may be caused by a cigarette or a charger unit too (despite it was linked to an outdoor mobile electric generator - seen that in conformity with security measures the cathedral has no power supply) but I really find myself at a loss to understand how could a qualified guard go to verify the situation in a wrong place when the fire alarm system was indicating the right location where the fire first started.

&amp;#x200B;

This is to say that this guard has nothing to do with such a job unless the fire would have originated from more than one place. 

&amp;#x200B;

Actually this is a good subject of discussion but don’t be surprised if it does not lead to a big one because first it’s ramadan (during which people have difficult mornings) and secondly common people interests are in general limited to country’s borders, then to international soccer and to arab world as well.

Do you think Macron is unusual? (Did you mean Macron?) I think he is very usual. He is a graduate of the  Ecole Nationale d’Administration and I think he's really just another typical elite enarque.

But, yeah, I get your point about so many other countries. I think it is a rubberband effect after the domination by the far left in social policy.

The way the Benalla  affair is evolving as well as that gilet jaune story give the proof that maybe more unsolvable crises are yet to come.

Actually many sources reproach him for selling Alstom (a French strategic company operating in nuclear energy) to the US General Electric. The deal first started when he was Deputy Secretary General of The Elysée and was then concluded when he was appointed Minister of Finances.

Already in 2017 voices from the French intelligent services warned of a manipulated operation between win-to-win parts. Now they are more and more loud at saying that his election was a reward for the service performed.  It seems that the way president François Hollande gave up for a second mandate and how François Fillon was “lynched”, both were orchestrated in a sense that nobody would be able to properly challenge Macron.

If you're booking with RAM you need to go through a travel agency that have online booking (there's like 50 dinars extra fee)

eoi0uh2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/bs0bag/,2,"Historically, education as we know it started that way. The puppet ""pasha"" at the time started some schools in the capital for the elite. They studied in french because they were meant to continue learning in french universities. And the teachers were french. And France wanted it that way. I guess countries are easier to control if their leaders speak your language.

Now, France is no different from other colonizers like great Britain: they traded and used the resources from the colonized countries. What they did different is that they wanted to integrate at least part of the colonized population culturally. You can see that the language is extremely important for France for instance a lot of french embassies have a cultural center, like Britain and USA they have a standard test to measure language proficiency, etc...

My belief is that colonial France had the foresight to recognize that the countries they colonized have more that minerals, underground resources and trade, they have a human capital. You can see the benefits they are getting with all the work force immigrating there.

English is different in someway. The difference is that there are immense benefits from integrating it to the student curriculum since most relevant scientific information always comes in English. And that is due to the USA (which is not a colonial force) that got ahead of the rest of the world especially after the world wars. Their scientific advances granted them what we call ""naming rights""; see, for instance algebra is called that way in English because Arabs have got naming rights for that... In a country that was colonized and liberated itself, it makes a lot of sense to make English one of its main languages for the benefit of education and trade. France guarded against that by enforcing its own language and keeping up with scientific advances so that french became an advantage for ex-colonies since they had more to gain by learning it (education, trade, geographic proximity...).

Also there is the fact that, in the immediate post independence period, most countries would be in need for trade to sustain and stabilize themselves which is an opportunity to trap them in a trade dependence which is consolidated with the fact that there is no language barrier.

Some countries are exceptions to this logic since they do not have a unique language (extremely important for governance) that unites the whole country like the ones that you listed. India has 18 languages spoken throughout the country and that is just the official languages... For these kind of demographic, the English language is an easy choice to make...

This is a really fascinating subject. I learned about this out of curiosity when, one day, I got in a bus with 5 (illiterate) Indians which could not understand each other. So take what I say with a grain of salt.

But if you think you'd rather stay in the cooler areas (i.e. near the coast), than after Djerba you can go North step by step: Gabes is a particular city as it is both an oasis and on the coast, Sfax has a nice vibrant old Medina (not touristy at all so you can really see how the actual locals use the Medina), Sousse has a beautiful beach directly adjacent to the city center. Sousse's Medina is more touristy and in a better shape than Sfax's, and there is a very old fort. From Sousse you're already less than 100km away from Ennfidha's airport.",2019-05-24 18:42:49

I am in the process of bringing cash-in-hand converted TNDs (in Euro form) to my Spanish bank account to be used as a deposit. It will be interesting to see how anti-money laundering checks will impede my ability to do this as I know of Russian ex-cops who appear in Spain to buy houses with suitcases of cash (rashwe, lol) under the allowed 10k€ non-declarable allowance and use it as deposits with pay slips showing their salaries in Roubles.

You *can* convert the TND into Euros on the black market. For legal purposes, I do not condone this nor will I engage in discussions of how this can be done. I am a foreigner - I am allowed to do things that Tunisians aren't. The trick here is to find a foreigner. Go out to Marsa, Avenue Habib Bourguiba, Hammamet in the summer and I am sure you'll find a solution if you are determined.

&gt; Saving accounts offer 5% intrest and risk free and inflation is around 7%

Right, -2% by keeping your money in a Tunisian bank which can default/collapse/give you the finger at any moment is better than keeping it under your pillow. Not sure what a SICAV even is but 4% is ridiculous. Lebanese banks offer you 15-18% in LBP deposits (The Lebanese Lira is pegged 1500 to the dollar and has kept this rate throughout three [civil] wars - you're getting 10+% in the US dollar essentially... the more you learn...), the Mongolian Tugrik and Armenian Dram are also stable currencies and are easy to get into/make money from

What you've written literally highlights an ""investment"" with an **inevitable** risk. You lose 2% of your money, this is **guaranteed**. Losses might be bigger.

epuu0x5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/bujpcp/,2,"The black market is...

You take your money out of the (financial and emotional) prison that is Tunisia, and:

All of the opportunities available to the rest of the world become available to you

You speak English. Learn about ways to make money in any part of the world - let's use real estate as an example. Learn what differentiates one (bad) investment prospect from one that is lucrative. Plenty of material exists online.

Learn how to leverage - how to bring x percentage of a big sum that you wish to invest and convince banks or people to lend you (ideally, much, much) more.

Spanish real estate is booming after the crash of 2016. In Spain, **all** transactions related to real estate (utility bill/property tax payments) must go through a Spanish(-based) bank account. When you first put money into your bank account, you must explain how you got it. You can take your Tunisian pay slips and account print-outs and translate them into Spanish. Take your money out in cash and swap it for an equivalent in euros. Bring it out of Tunisia (use your imagination) and then go to Spain.

Show the papers (which may or may not be requested - my grandmother had to show how she made 30k over 20 years of living in London working for a reputable institution, her son, my uncle, didn't have to show anything for 20k - YMMV) and then with proof of your stable salary (which covers the cost of the monthly repayment) - ask for a mortgage. If you say ""this money was gifted to me by my uncle"", they will ask for ""your uncle's"" paperwork, lol.

It's not ""the black market"" per se - you just need to convert your dinars into a foreign currency (which may or may not be illegal, depending on who you are and how you go about doing) and find a way of investing it (perhaps by first investing in a place that doesn't ask questions about how your money was made, like Northern, Turkish-occupied Cyprus which is also booming at the moment, and then selling off the appreciated assets and showing that increase in value as the source of your income to more intrusive jurisdictions, like Spain) - I guess ""washing money"" - the only crime being that you ignored Tunisian laws on how to money is to be brought out of the country.

China has limits on how much money you can move overseas. Big time ballers buy Rolexes for 40k+ euros in Monaco with their Visa cards and then refund it at the same store almost imediately for a small comission (ahem, bribe) and get the refund in cash (or to a bank account of their chosing, elsewhere in the free world).

If you have money to invest, we have something to discuss. Otherwise, your goals should be accumulating capital. If you insist that big money can be made in Tunisia, I wish you luck!

&amp;#x200B;

Well yes, I left out some details, their divorce was essentially complete by the time I left Egypt and in fact my mother waived all her financial rights as long as he contributed towards my sister's living expenses and left my mother the hell alone. But, yeah long story short once again, about year after my departure from Egypt the situation got really bad and my mother was forced to leave due to multiple factors. So if there is any legal trouble it is between my mother and former step father regarding the custodial issue of my sister, but that is between them as grown adults, especially as I was not even in Egypt at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

My main fear stems from me mainly being worried that my former step father might have put my name on some charges just for good measure and given my absence from the country and the not so righteous Egyptian legal system that maybe the courts went along with such a move, despite the fact that I was not even there.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, during my research I stumbled upon an old treaty between Egypt and Tunisia from 1976 in which clauses regarding extradition are included, but evidently I have no clue whether or not in general this treaty is still valid or enforced. I even searched the internet to find stories of extraditions between the two countries, but in vain.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the link to the treaty, if you are interested:  [https://www.mfa.gov.eg/Lists/Treaties/Attachments/2349/2\_ar.pdf](https://www.mfa.gov.eg/Lists/Treaties/Attachments/2349/2_ar.pdf) 

&amp;#x200B;

But as another commentator mentioned earlier, I am most probably tripping, since it is virtually impossible that there is something against me in Egypt, let alone that even if there was something that this would mean extradition during a random trip to Tunisia.

&amp;#x200B;

So once again thanks for your post and I hopefully will get to see Tunisia as I have heard that it is absolutely beautiful, but this whole mess is casting with the whole uncertainty that comes along with it a shadow over this otherwise really nice trip.",2019-06-04 16:39:32

Also INSAT graduates are highly regarded in the job market especially in Tunisia and many (most even) of them do their PFE abroad.

Now on the bad side you'll only get a limited choice of specialty ( 6 in total). The administration is really incompetent, kind of corrupt and generally unhelpful. Some teachers will give grades at random and others will gladly take bribes (money or otherwise if you're a girl) for good grades.

Being free can't be easy, and the road to prosperity can't be easy either, you can't have a garden of eden in a day and night. And recognizing the deep corruption and the faults in the country is the first step toward fixing them, burrying your head in the sand and waiting for a miracle will fix nothing, and things will only get worse before getting better.

&amp;#x200B;

Tunisia is in a so deep sh-t hole that it can't get any worse. The only way it can go is better, and I have high hopes that that is the only direction we'll be heading, sooner or later, maybe later, do you know why? Because you won't find any Tunisian satisfied by the situation of the country and the situation of their lives, and that's a good thing, because we can only improve when we admit our faults and hate our current situation, being happy about how things are makes you unable to bring change.

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest threat to Tunisia is corruption and nothing else, it have nothing to do with the type of the ruling regime. And the reason a dictatorship or a military rule or a monarchy are a bad idea, is because they bring even more corruption, the lack of transparency and freedome is what brought Tunisia to the current situation at the first place, when you can't go the court because a company stole money or when you can't sue someone because they have more money than you or more connections things becomes like this, that's what dictatorship means, you can't hurt the corrupt and powerful people because they have money, connections, and power, because you don't have the freedome to fight for your right or the freedome to speak up, that's what dictatorship means.

I wish you mentioned that from the start, that you're soon to be a Tunisian citizen.

And btw, you can't be really considered as Tunisian in the general sense even if you obtain the citizenship, your children will, and even more their children, same goes for Tunisians who obtain citizenship in another country, I'm not being one-sided here because you're english, you're very welcome and I'm glad that you like living here and decided to become Tunisian, but everything should be in order, that's my opinion. In other words, your political opinions about certain topics (not all) in Tunisia can be sensitive and not taken very respectfully.

&amp;#x200B;

Also your frequent comments about Tunisia being a monarchy or dictatorship is better than democracy, or that arabs can't have democracy are not comments of someone hoping to become Tunisian, if you don't value freedome and democracy I suggest you know your place.

Such comments can be tolerated coming from other Tunisians considering what the country have been throught in the last 8 years and all, but coming from a foreigner who's from a free and democratic country and even wanting to become Tunisian is unacceptable and even puts in question your desire to become Tunisian in the first place.

Lets see how well you'll do without your english citizenship in a dictatorship and corrupt countries, lets try Saudi Arabia, or maybe try to speak up against corruption or against the regime in the pre-revolution Tunisia, then lets hear your opinion again.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I guess as you explain it that way it's not a  bad idea, either it's dooable or not is an entirely other story. And between the self pride and the possible benefits is an even bigger story, so let's leave it that.

Even more, we have a lot to work on in Tunisia first, even if we were to become a part of France, that wouldn't solve corruption over night, certain things we need to fix ourselves else it will be fruitless, so again will we really see real change?Also why would France ever do that, France literrally steals from many African countries to sustain itself, and I see that you understand very well, having to spend money on those countries won't be in it's own interest. 

A type of union like a medeterranian union would be much more dooable and a much better idea.

&amp;#x200B;

Living in Tunisia you should at least have the minimum amount of knowledge about Islam, cultural practices like ""bacha bazi"" and whatnot are not Islamic practices and not demanded in Islam.

I understand trying to eliminate those backward practices, but what do you mean exactly by saying muslim countries will no longer be muslim?

&amp;#x200B;

And nowhere in Islam does it say that anyone who speaks Arabic is an Arab or anyone who converts to Islam is an Arab, even more, what does this have to do with what we were talking about?

I'm pretty sure I know my religion so you may keep your sources.

You know you are just talking about Hamas right ? And you know Hamas are currently being besieged from all sides by Israel and Egypt where their water supply is basically poisoned right ? Imagine being surrondered from all sides and having to watch 2 milion other people being slowly killed, wouldn't you hate the one responsible ?

&gt;  Israel is the largest economy in the region 

Wealth doesn't make someone good, and Saudi Arabia is wealthier than Israel, does this make it a paragon of virtue ? Of course not.

&gt;yet you are still living in the past and your Palestinians are poor, uneducated and think that they would dislodge Israel because they have some retard in Lebanon living like a king and making them believe that he’s got their backs?? LMFAO. PLEASE!!!

You'll be transiting Frankfurt (most likely) when flying from Tunis to Kiev so you'll trip off their bomb/smoke detectors so you'll need a note from the range in Ukraine explaining what you were doing there.

eu8le1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/cd3d1y/,2,"\[Message was too long, exceeded limit lol xD Cutting it into parts\]

I've studied both, dropped out of med school after the 3rd year to change studies to computer science, so I think I might be able to help. Although I might be biased.

Medicine itself is a noble and great job. But you really need to love it to excel at it. In tunisia right now it is in huge decline. It's getting very ""saturated"" in CHUs (university hospitals) and hospitals of cities in general. They're not actually saturated, but it's the state making it look that way. Cuz even though, statistically they could employ more doctors in cities (we're still not at the ratio of doctors per citizen that's in europe), the state just doesn't have the money or equipment to employ more doctors in the city hospitals. So the places of recruting new doctors dedicated to each department (service) are very limited. I'll explain how later.

And if you want to work in rural areas, there really is no equipment to work with. Doctors there are struggling to even do the basics, that's why you see many objecting working there. It's not that they want a ""luxurious"" life or anything like many people think, they just got tired of feeling powerless everytime they cannot save a person or are too late because this or that equipment is missing... it gets to a point where it becomes psychologically consuming, burns you out and makes you despair to see people go while you, the doctor are powerless to do anything because there's nothing you can work with in the first place! They put doctors in empty hospitals expecting them to do miracles, but there's a limit to how much a human alone could do... with no staff, no equipment... there's a reason why we invented all those machines. If we could save lives with doctors alone we wouldn't have created them, would we? 

Let's not not even talk about residency exam (which takes place after 5 years of study), in which less than half the students get to be doctors and the rest need to retake the exam. (which, btw, in most european and north americain countries, the ratio of matching-up for residency is more than 95%). That's simply because the tunisian government can't pay all those doctors anymore. And another reason is, with the new program, they're trying to make it even harder to prove the foreign countries that the tunisian diploma can be as good as theirs so that it becomes acknowledged by the EU and all. It's all messed-up politics.

And there's the obligatory year of military service.

And then, among those residents, for each department, there is usually about one or two places (?) vacant for a new recruit, the rest have to find work somewhere else, out of the hospital, in the private sector, maybe joining a pre-established clinic or they take a loan to build their own medical office (cabinet).

It's hard, it needs work, patience, a long breath, and perseverence. And with how things are with the tunisian economy, it is starting to get into risky playground and miiiight or might not pay off in the end.

So it's better to know from now, that you probably won't be working for the public sector, but the private one. And for this, you might wanna consider that you'd need money in the process.

However, if you work hard on the assistanat might get a good rank to garantee a place in the hospital.

But really, the public sector has awful working conditions anyways (except for department chefs (chef-services) and professors and ""professeurs agrégés"", who really, not all but many, exploit and abuse the APC system: they ignore their hospital work, let their assistants do all their work while they do private consultation all day long).

And those assistants themselves put all the charge on the residents and interns, who really burn out from work...

But you can avoid this toxic work environment in easier departments, or ones where people actually love what they do. The most toxic ones are where the money is. The specialties that people chose for money rather than passion. You'll find tons of toxic people there (with some exceptions ofc). But from my internships and what I hear from my professors, friends, and parents of friends (many of my friends are from families of doctors): Specialties like gynecology, cardiology, dermatology, surgery-based specialties... might be ones of the worst. But before choosing, just pay attention during rotations of your internships to the exchanges between the staff members, and try to get a picture about the policy and work environment in said department you are in, and how the relationship between the different doctors and residents is.

Just throwing my own personal (maybe biased) note: from what I've seen the best department is psychiatry. Because almost everyone hates the specialty, and only the truly passionate choose it xD And the ones who look for money through it go to the private sector immediately, because the hospital in-wards have nearly no gain (due to the stigma in tunisia concerning going to psych wards and all). So from what I've seen it's the most friendly one xD

The only value a professor at ENSI can give you is make it more digestible for you, but in many subjects he'll just have the same powerpoint presentation he recites by heart every year with no room for extensive questions on your part, so you'll be better of complementing your lessons with the Internet anyway).

Go on any job search portal in Tunisia and I'll tell you what most of the job offers you'll find there for engineers ask for: Java, Javascript and frameworks, J2EE, the odd C++/Android/Python offer... 

==
Look around more on Reddit and you'll see that worldwide it's the same: your first job (Entry-level job) won't likely be designing something from scratch for a company (by using any ""complex"" knowledge), you'll be working on an already existing project and you'll be there just to modify it a bit (according to the client's wishes).

=====
Desiging products won't be in your hands, but in the hands of the more experienced engineers. To get there, you need to pass the recruitement barrier first. Then have from 2 to 5 years of experience working there. You either get very lucky, and apply apply APPLY until a company finds itself in dire need of manpower and will accept you because no one else better than you applied to the job (even if they know you're really shit), or you'll have to do like most everyone else: charm them with your CV. Or else, get stuck at home.

===
To charm them with your CV, you need a.. hmmm.. Charming and fluffy CV.

There are still who recruit and who think that for example ""It was general knowledge from when I was 30 years younger that X school is strong, therefore I'll still give prefetential treatement to graduates of this school even 30 years later just because of the diploma"" , but :
1) this is no longer the majority of the cases. Most recruiters now see your diploma, any diploma, as a proof that you're a good boy who have the nerves to obey orders under pressure, nothing more. As older people die out and get replaced, you might find your ""Better school but only on paper diploma"" practically the same 5 years later to the ""underestimated but actually better school diploma'
2) this is only valid in certain places, IN TUNISIA ONLY
3) even then you will not be asked, or needed in whatever esoteric, arcane theoretical knowledge you might now. Only programming knowledge at first.

= 
I say you learn what actually matters to you first, and get help learning it, then learn from the internet all the rest when you need it. 

OR, spend years at a school that teaches you nothing you actually need first, keep your papers and notebooks from there stored in safety in case you EVER actually need them years down the road, then spend even more time learning what you actually need to get better jobs at better companies or to go work abroad, assuming you have all that time and energy ofc (people actually can fail at ENSI, people who used to be top of their classes, and you only have 1 year of ""redoublage"" allowed, + 1 other but you'll need extra papers and permission from the university Never say it'll never happen to me, only to others.). Or pay for expensive certifications to get in the same level as your colleagues from other schools in the entry-level job, while they get promoted faster than you :)

Until our country improves its exports, no other country will accept our currency, therefor, an unlimited international bank account that works with services like paypal will likely never happens within the next 5 or 10 years.

#YOU DON'T NEED PAYPAL TO FREELANCE!!

&amp;nbsp; 

I am really surprised by how much young people who are supposed to be ""the internet generation"" lack one of the essential internet skills, **GOOGLING!**

There is plenty of other ways to receive money, some of them are a bit expensive than paypal but it doesn't really matter, these services usally offer an international bank account with an international MasterCard that you can link to your **TUNISIAN** paypal, and use it to shop online.

you can't receive money directly to Tunisian paypal though, you can only **PAY**.


&amp;nbsp; 

You can also apply for the ""Carte technologique"" which gives you 1,000dt/year , its bullshit but its enough to pay for some subscriptions in freelancing platforms, and if you are sure of your abilities you can start a company and get 10,000dt/year. 

&amp;nbsp; 

And finally if things are really good for you, you can open a €-bank account here (you need proof of foreign income) and your bank will give you an international credit card linked to your tunisian €-bank account.

&amp;nbsp; 

What i want to say is that basically if you are a beginner, then no client will ever hire you directly (too risky) instead they will use a Freelancing platform (upwork, fiverr, etc..), the client will pay you **in the platform**, your money will be saved **in the platform**, these platforms are **more than aware** that a lot of freelancers came from countries like ours, and they have tons of methods to easily pay you, usually all you need is a bank account and they will send the money to you.",2019-07-27 14:03:44

Also, Sidi bou said is beautiful and has some great scenery.  Bardo and Carthage museums are good suggestions others have made too.

As for being careful, /r/DarkGan0n gave some great advice but I'd just say that remember you are a tourist and follow the tourist rules as you would anywhere.  Keep your items with you, don't trust someone just because they seem friendly.  Cellphone theft is big here so make sure to keep that secure when you have it out using it or even when it's in your pocket.  Don't carry a lot of cash on you at once.  If someone does try to rob you, don't resist and just give them what they ask.  There are some very desperate people here just as there is everywhere.  If you go to a shop with trinkets and gifts, NEGOTIATE prices.  If you know Arabic, speak it.  I've been quoted crazy prices for stuff before like 45tnd for a small hookah that I know costs about 10-12 elsewhere.  Then my Tunisian wife joined me and they're like ""Oh!  Your wife is Tunisian... yeah I'll give you the Tunisian price then"".  So please know, that shit exists :)",2019-07-29 10:04:11

2. North Africa exists in its own right.
3. North Africa will never abide by ideologies, regimes or paradigms which disadvantage its people and undermine their interests. 
4. North Africa must become the center of its own knowledge production and establish the technical, scientific and industrial spheres required to manufacture its own future and not be enmeshed in and dependent on those outside itself.  
5. North Africa doesn't exist to serve the interests of foreign peoples and powers. In fact, it has a separatist attitude towards the rest of the world. Our ambassadors will be shrewd scientists who are sent abroad to objectively examine the nations of the world looking for innovations, breakthroughs and insights there which can be brought to the attention of the home country to be harnessed for its own good.

I’m also not sure about each of the other countries’ econ policy and objectives atm, but it would be really difficult for us to achieve our regional goals as we are obviously underweighted, currency-wise, by comparison to the other members. It will be hard to lobby for our interests (a high interest rate environment to curb inflation) especially if other members are divergent on this point. We will also lose tariffs (which represent a high percentage of gov income) from member states, simultaneously affecting Tunisian products, industries and employment negatively (Algerian and especially Moroccan products are quite known to have higher quality).

ew3n07k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/clv04s/,2,"Sorry to be harsh, but if the school was giving you inappropriate grades the the adjusted grade is the one you earned.   


In my degree - which I graduated with honours from a top Western university and the highest in the school I was in of around 800, I had something similar.

  
In my econometrics exam I got 100%. 5 other universities moderate the exam before it is released and after the results are in. It was determined that it was too easy (due to the combination of questions). My mark was moderated down. I ended up getting 60% - even though I got every question right and no matter the questions asked, as I understand the mathematical/economic theory I'd have got 90%+).  


I love that this happened. I mean, this moderation should have occurred before setting the final paper better - but my university stays as world world renowned and has a high quality reputation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Many universities are incentive to inflate grades - to cover bad teaching or to make people want to study there. However soon this will erode the country/institutions educational reputation. 

  
I'm so proud of Tunisia for doing this.  


For you personal, it is so unfortunate. It is a terrible thing that hasn't happened - but these things **need** to happen to protect us all. I'm very sorry for your situation though. I wish you all the best in all your other classes and hope you pull through this.

Hi, you're welcome! Ahlan wa sahlan!

&gt;  
&gt;**I did not know specificly this, But i was aware.**  
&gt;  
&gt;About Turkish people, more than 25% of Tunisian people have Turkish blood, about Turkey, there is one majority view but plenty of views with plenty of followers, they are mainly :  
&gt;  
&gt;1- Turkey is a bad country who supports khwanjia and Daesh and ruled by a dictator, its past, the ottoman empire, were oppressors and invaded and destroyed our country  
&gt;  
&gt;**Someone told me this last time i come.**  
&gt;  
&gt;2- Turkey is a good country who supports Muslims all around the world and ruled by a caliph  
&gt;  
&gt;**Never heard from any Tunisian about that.**  
&gt;  
&gt;3- Turkey is just a great destination for tourism and having good time, nothing more  
&gt;  
&gt;**Everyone i meet, they told me about the beauty of place, history and others.**  
&gt;  
&gt;These views are from my experience with lots of Tunisians, from teachers to friends to family members  
&gt;  
&gt;Good luck learning Arabic, hopefully you will achieve it, as for visiting, honestly, summer is the best time for visiting because in the winter, things become bad especially the flood and when this happens, you won't find no where to go, no taxi, no bus, no train, no nothing and not even walking, the day will short so shops will close very very early and it would rare to see the sun and so the weather will  be always very very cold, so yeah it's best to come in summer or at least spring  
&gt;  
&gt;**Yes in winter, especially hammamet turns a dead city. In last winter i was planned to go la frigua park for zoo, almost 3 hour i wait for train. For backing hammamet (bir bouagbe) the driver shared his phone number with me, but unfortantely i dont have gsm. I had to call him from someone i just meet in the zoo, for backing hammamet. Around 40-50 minutes later the train come, and i landed. Good but dangerous story. I m still remembering that station of la frigua parc.

ex1l6yb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/cn4aud/,2,"This is like saying if Muslims are islamophobic or not, here is how i see it from my experience

It's just there are lots of people who don't like beards, for simply no reason, some do link it with terrorism but generally it's just how they feel, they aren't comfortable with it for some reason, some others want to mimic the lifestyle of other European and North American countries and so they won't like beards unless Europeans start growing it (which is ignorance since plenty of Americans for example have beards that can reach their feet)

So it depends on the person, this beard issue isn't a big deal, whats a big deal it's the obvious targeting of Islam by the politicians here, some of them can't even stand the first article that says Islam is the official religion and will do anything to remove it, many of them sadly have a position in the government

I really don't know, I've never been able to properly explore what dating a Tunisian girl is like, so it's an experience I'd love to live through and understand if it really is what I'm looking for.""

Honestly, you make it sound like a game or small and it shouldn't be if that's what you mean, plus Tunisian women are like British women, both of them are human and females and on top of all this, Tunisian women aren't all the same, same thing for British women, same thing even for men, everyone has something unique

I'm not judging you or anything, i'm just being honest

""Tunisia is very progressive in terms of the Arab world in my opinion. Girls are free to wear almost anything they want without harassment, and that alone is refreshing compared to Saudi Arabia for example. The freedoms and liberties in Tunisia look to surpass most other Arab nations, and for that I'm so proud.""

Actually, that's not the exact truth, sure women can wear whatever they want but too much revealing clothes will get you into trouble (we were pissed at a naked man, so let alone naked woman) and the harassment from people always exist and police harassment too (like how they arrested a couple for kissing in public)

And some other Arab countries have that kind of freedom too, Like Lebanon but yeah, it's true that in comparison to other Arab countries Tunisia is better but we shouldn't be limited to Arab countries only because in front of the rest of the world, Tunisia is still a backward country in almost everything

""And sorry again lol, I feel like I'm not being very clear with my post. By a ""western"" Tunisian, I mean someone who has adopted a western culture to an extent, therefore to more closely relate to myself. Someone who isn't as bound by religion perhaps is a more literate way to put it. Someone who doesn't necessarily drink alcohol, but isn't strictly opposed to it and frown upon it (I don't drink myself, but bars and nightclubs are a large part of social life in the UK) etc.""

Yup, the culture is different, i didn't deny that and there is no single way of finding the right person, plenty of ways exist but rushing it won't help

&gt;I think I'm better off just deleting this post it was a mistake. My mannerisms and intent are being misunderstood and I'm running into the exact issue I'm trying to explain. The way we talk is different. The way I speak English isn't literal on every word. Context and meaning behind the sentence makes up most of the intent of the words I say.

Nah, you're dude, you were just thinking about something and thought of making a post about it on reddit, most redditors do that and me included but you should always make sure of being before complaining about being misundertood but i understand you

&gt;Women are all different yes, but you'd be foolish to think you should marry the first woman you speak to and not try and find your soulmate.

Well i didn't say pick the first one, what i'm trying to say is tiring yourself for finding a relationship that might not work out isn't a good idea, so you should take it easy and have what's available for you, another point i'm trying to show is that nationality is simply a nationality, it won't make a woman different, you can even have both a Tunisian and British woman and there is plenty of them, so pick the woman that suits you, not simply because she is a Tunisian",2019-08-16 15:36:36

excx2rt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/cs652n/,2,"90% of darja is Arabic, this is like saying the US should make American English an official language even though it's not different from the rest of other English dialects, a dialect is a way of reading a language, a seperate language is a language that is completely separate and has its own characteristics that makes it unique, Maltese language is a big example, it was once an Arabic dialect and after many years it became a separate language

Tunisian Arabic is like i said 90%, Maltese is probably 50%, so we actually use Arabic but kinda different in pronunciation, like for example, ""Ahmed 5oya mshi ya9ra fel makteb/my brother Ahmed went to school"" all of that words are Arabic, here is another example, a random conversation :

Mother : Bara 3ayesh weldi imshi lel 7anot weshri 5obza

Son : Bahi Ma, hani mashi, a3tini el flous

Mother : 5o w ma tansash el ba9i

Again, all of those words are Arabic but kinda pronounced different, just like how Americans say mum and British people say mom, or doughnut in British and donut in American, dude in American, mate in British

Another point is we understand the other Arabic dialect because they are mostly Arabic too and so still a dialect

And finally, using Darja to study maths and science or writing official papers with it will be a huge problem and the reasons are obvious

So in conclusion, Tunisian Arabic/Darja is still a dialect",2019-08-18 20:55:38

Now, I'm not sure if a Tunisian tourist visa is renewable (probably it is, once) but you can always leave and re-enter the country to get another 90 days.

For work, I believe you or your employer have to apply for a Tunisian working permit for you, which replaces your visa as the legal document of your stay in the country. Sadly I could only find the information in  French, even when switching to English on the ministry of employment's website (you can see it [here](http://www.emploi.gov.tn/en/employement/international-employment/emploi-des-etrangers/)).

For the living cost, I see you mentioned things about hotels, and staff members :) so here's a [link](https://www.expatistan.com/cost-of-living/sousse?currency=GBP) that might be helpful for living costs in Sousse, I've selected the option to see prices in GBP for reference.

* Football match between EST and CA meant either 1) collective absence or 2) riots with cops showing up at the end .
* You had to bring your own mouse in computer science because the ones provided by the school just kept getting stolen
* In my 9th year the thugs of the school and their endless horde of brain-dead companions thought it was a great idea to have a da5la which was made possible by the new retarded principal who legit climbed on the roof with them and was having the fun of his life

I wasn't particularly bullied tho ( Could've been much worse considering how slim and socially awkward I was ) .

Closest moment to dying was when my classmate randomly threw a rock that hit me right in the head ( I was bleeding like shit , few days later had a few centimeters inflation) .

I know most will consider this advice as utter garbage but if you get bullied don't hesitate a second to directly tell the teacher and **Fuck the people saying you're a pussy for getting administration / parents involved .** I didn't mess around with that and would almost always get any bully suspended .",2019-09-01 17:46:26

eyr5mlr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/cyc2wn/,2,"Some meals I find quite delicious are  [Leblebi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leblebi) ,  [Mulukhiyah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulukhiyah) and very obviously  [Couscous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couscous) . 

I'd also recommend having a Barbecue ( you can usually find the restaurants on the roads from Tunis to Sousse ( not the highway ) ). It's a bit wild but kinda worth it IMO . 

About the sweets there's  [this tunisian chain](https://www.masmoudi.tn/) that sells all sort of traditional sweet things . It's a bit pricey but the quality is pretty damn good . 

Otherwise when you're hanging around Sidi bou said you can find [Bambalouni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bambalouni) which is fairly cheap and extremely delicious . 

I don't know about the price for the taxi ride but always insist on the counter working . Else you're 100% getting ripped-off

My solution is never go in a empty place and always walk in the main road and walk with someone else if you can, a relative or friend and if you smell danger take a rock and put it in your pocket in case someone attacks you you throw at his head and run away

ez98us1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/d05n34/,2,"Depends where OP is from, for me living in Europe, tunisian bars (excluding hard alcohol) are extremely cheap, like dirt cheap, I got a pint of lager for TD5 which is like £1.50, cheapest pint where i'm from is maybe £3.50 if you're very lucky, and maybe £5/6 in London again if you're lucky. Hard liquor on the other hand is veeeeeery expensive in tunisia, unless it's boukha. 

@OP depends how you wanna go about it, you can go to black market sellers and get some beers cheap and quick or you can try find a supermarchet that sells alcohol which i think are far and few between, most of them only sell non alcoholic, your best bet is going to a bar or club, where you'll find like minded people and if you aren't tunisian then the prices are more than reasonable.",2019-09-06 13:24:29

ezefvk1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/d0lxf2/,2,"It isn't as broken as you claim. Students do use the language every single day. If they watch the news, it's in Arabic. If they watch cartoons, It's in Arabic. If they watch foreign movies or shows, the subtitles are in Arabic. If they read the Quran, it's in Arabic. If they receive their birth certificate, it's in Arabic.
  
I'd argue Tunisians are exposed to MSA as much as they are exposed to the Tunisian dialect of Arabic. It's just that they use the Tunisian dialect for communication with other Tunisians and MSA for almost everything else. And rightfully so, our dialect is purely a regional dialect of Arabic with some deformed French vocabulary mixed in. It is not a language nor can it ever dream of being one. It is not suited for educational purposes and it would be easier and wiser to make people study in another language than it is to salvage derja.  
And about switching languages in education, it's done in almost every country in the world. In higher education, you're almost always going to need English. Be it France, Germany, Switzerland, Japan or any other developed country who's native language is not English, there are always courses in English. It's just the case that we do it rather early on.  
And I think it's actually a good thing for a myriad of reasons:  
First of all, there are not that many quality resources for advanced science in Arabic. That's why switching to French gives you a chance to make use of many resources you did not have access to previously.  
Second, learning the same subjects in another language makes you focus more on the underlying concepts rather than the way they are expressed and discourages you from dumb memorization. In fact, learning maths, physics, technology, science etc... in French made me better able to understand those subjects, not just in French but also in English. Now that I started understanding the essence of these subjects, I could actually express them in English with just a bit of work. I could also use the thousands of free online resources in English to supplement my learning and broaden my knowledge. And now that I'm learning German, I reckon I will be able to express the very same core ideas in a year or two.  
Overall, I think this experience is a good thing not a bad thing as you claim.",2019-09-07 13:36:11

ezetq4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/d0lxf2/,2,"For your first question, as is the case with all languages, input is necessary to get good. In one's native language, communication is enough. But in other languages, you need to read books and watch videos and hear people speak that language in order to get good.  
But we don't start learning French until we're 8 years old. And we don't get good until long after. For someone that age, Arabic is inevitable for all forms of entertainment so input isn't really an issue for them. As we get older, however, we use Arabic less and less in favour of other languages and start to get rusty. But it's not the least bit unexpected. If we stopped speaking Tunisian Arabic and listening to it for a few years, we will get worse at it.  
Also, I understand that English is close to French, but that wasn't what I was getting at. I could learn maths in Chinese, Norwegian, Russian, Urdu or what have you. It still wouldn't matter. As long as I can understand Polish, I can solve math problems in Polish.

So my point is, you really don't have to worry about your previous performance, because it doesn't dictate in any way how you will do fel bac.  If you study hard and smart, you get what you want, or better than what you expect. Sinon aal philo, I had 8.5, w I had 10 fel aarbi which had the same coefficient as info, so you don't need to worry about these subjects with low coefficients, as long as you do well fel les matieres principal, and believe me, if you study well, you will find that they are easier than les langues w those subjects.

And the links I or the other commenters shared, none were done by partisan organisations. Kais himself never denied any of his religious viewpoints. He explicitely stated them in his interviews.

And the death penalty might work on paper, in theory, but it is inhumane and unjust. Because, within a corrupt judging system, it will be abused by people of power. Innocent people will be killed. And even if we suppose it's not the case in Tunisia and it's perfect here, judges are still human and can make mistakes in their ruling.

I didn't feel it was necessary to share more proofs about him as it's all been mentioned by others here already. You're free to believe them or not.

My stance on death penalty has never been about numbers and was always based on feelings. Yes those should be punished, but not killed... They may realise their mistake and become better people and redeem themselves in prison, first of all. And as I said before there's always chance of errors in ruling. I meant mistakes discovered way later down the line. It happens. Also no it isn't an effective deterrent, just look at the US system, death penalty in some states still didn't stop future offenders.

It's not bogus research. We'll see more of his words and way of thinking in the upcoming days, and we'll know if those interviews are true or not. It's not good to go around calling bogus everything you don't agree with...

And no there is something wrong with expressing his opinions when those opinions are extreme and he isn't just anybody, but a presidential candidate. This is not islamophobia. I don't even like France and don't wanna have any ties to it. And I'm a practicing muslim (but to be 100% honest, I lack in terms of irregular prayer), but I still don't want our country to turn into Iran or something.

We should be preferring languages based on their consistency in their transformations from regular statements to mathematical logic. Mathematical logic being the most fundemental language of all sciences.

English is not consistent. Prepositions, which are fundemental in mathematical logic, are not consistant and usually illogical; for example, ""in"" vs ""of"" (changes based on the sentence, no set grammatical rule). Furthermore, words are not catagorized and cannot be placed in sentences based on a universal grammatical rule; for instance, ""worder"" vs ""more word"" (superlative forms are not consistent and words are not catagorized well to help make them consistant). Hard-to-define grammatical rules and hard-to-define catagorizations. 

I don't know much about French. If it is similar to English, then it holds the same issues. Chinese is extremely inconsistant, it didn't even evolve into a letter-based language. 

Arabic is consistant and nearly all Arabic grammatical special cases are accounted for. I would give all Semitic languages an approval to be used in science (All of them are old languages that are logic-based). Latin is also a consistent and logical language.",2019-09-17 12:39:13

Internet censorship in Tunisia significantly decreased in January 2011, following the ouster of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, as the new acting government removed filters on social networking sites such as YouTube.The success of the Tunisian Revolution offers a chance to establish greater freedom of expression in Tunisia, a country previously subject to very strict censorship, especially online. At the same time success in this effort is not certain. In response to the dramatic events and opportunities of the Arab Spring, in March 2011, Reporters Without Borders moved Tunisia and Egypt from its ""Internet enemies"" list to its list of countries ""under surveillance"". However, there are also warnings that Internet censorship in some countries might increase following the events of the Arab Spring.

***

**Censorship in Tunisia**

Censorship in Tunisia has been an issue since the country gained independence in 1956. Though considered relatively mild under President Habib Bourguiba (1957–1987), censorship and other forms of repression became common under his successor, President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali (November 1987–January 2011). Ben Ali was listed as one of the ""10 Worst Enemies of the Press"" by the Committee to Protect Journalists starting in 1998. Reporters Without Borders named Ben Ali as a leading ""Predator of Press Freedom"".

Yes of course, the newer generation is all about acceptance of others’ choices and you certainly won’t get in any trouble with them when they find out you’re an atheist, to be fair they just wouldn’t even care honestly. But the elderly aren’t really known for their tolerance towards anything that goes against religion and/or culture. Especially “shirk” and homosexuality. My only advice for you is to turn it down a notch when you’re around them, might as well just pretend you’re one of them just to avoid any inconveniencs (by no means am I saying don’t be yourself, but I think you get the idea). Oh, and please don’t provoke anyone by mentioning it every other second. This is supposed to be a private affair. If nobody asked you about your beliefs, what’s the point of bringing it up?

he's corrupt. well true, so is many of the other candidates and parties but no one says shit about it, and kais who has no electoral program and no actual relevent amount of money in his bank account will probably end up being the same (you think kais wants to be a hero? he wants a paycheck like the rest)

he has no regard for the law that's true I suppose but kais also has no regard for the law or the goverment as he wants to dissolve the tunisian goverment and have recourse to religion (ie islam) rather than laws. (read his ""program"")

I feel like no one bothers to read his interviews or even listen to them but everyone is overzealous about googling karoui and pointing out his shit.",2019-09-25 23:03:42
f1fuvy3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/d96tq4/,2,"&gt; he has a private channel so what really, he will keep brainwashing people either way just like kais is playing reverse psychology with the masses

Not only does he have the channel, but moreover a party that'll likely get A LOT of votes, so he can do A LOT more damage to the country than if kais was to be voted in

I did read his interview here

http://acharaa.com/ar/424819

And the worst part about kais is him wanting to abolish funding for NGOs (a huge catastrophe) but if you check the liberties observatory or whatever it's called on facebook, Karoui isn't for liberties either and in the end, conservative or not, they're both as bad on that front, kais isn't worse (except on the weed depenalisation)

Don't get me wrong both the candidates suck really hard, it's just that karoui sucks even harder",2019-09-25 23:19:08

f1oudoe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/da6ryl/,2,"Yes there's increase in numbers of immigrants from Subsaharien Africa during those recent years. Basically, there's 3 types of immigrants here : the ones who works in low skilled jobs that most tunisian refuse to do ( agriculture, construction and service sector..) with lower salary and more working hours compared to tunisians. Tunisia is also a transit country most of them are staying temporarily while waiting for an opportunity to escape to Europe ( that's why you're seeing them doing nothing). Only minority of them have a regulated jobs since the job market in Tunisia is relatively closed to Subsaharien Africans.
Economically, it could be beneficial if we started to apply a selective process of immigration based on our needs since there's a huge imbalance between supply and demand in the labor market here.
Demographically speaking, we are already in deep shit, the dependency ratio between the youth and the elderly is fucked up, we have a huge numbers of youth who are unemployed and a rising number of elderly with empty social security.

I won't be of much help as I dont know of such stores in tunisia but I can give you some advice so you save money in the process haha

- cat beds: most of the time, the kitty will probably sleep on your bed or on the sofas etc I would advise you to make a pass on that

- cat trees : in my experience, cats really like to be in high spots and have an overview of the space. I would suggest you get one of the un-complicated ones.
(As you mentioned, the ones with like 4 levels and swings etc are more towards the multiple cat households)

- cats toys : in my experience, every cat is different and has his own preferences. 
Mine like things that roll (could be even a scrunched recript) and toys in the form of a fishing poll but with feathers simulating a bird at the end, he would chase it for a long time.

The only Tunisian people who believe that gay people should have rights (gay marriage etc..) are either paid to encourage it or are simply affected by the new concept of freedom that embodies in fake freedoms such as the mirath thing, women rights that only consider freedom of dressing and forgets about the working women in the fields and the examples keep on going. This has impacted the true core meaning of freedom since the revolution and that's what Kais Said is trying to say: You're free to be gay but we will not support outer organizations to fund or give money to people for being gay. As for my opinion, I do not fully agree with him in this, I actually think that there are a few true gay people in Tunisia. 


As for his political plan, I don't think a man like him would walk into the presidential race with empty hands, this has been worrying a lot of people including myself but I trust him more than other candidates and to be honest his plans couldn't be more vague than Nabil El Karoui's spaghetti campaign.",2019-09-29 10:30:54

Bear in mind that you are only allowed for sivp if you have graduated or stopped university education. And you are not allowed to benefit from sivp if you're still studying. (Though i'm not sure how strict the state is in this detail).

Dived the country by the state ( by this i mean give governance independence to the 24 states )
Unless there is an over all difind  policy for development and laws each state will go in a very different direction ( and i say this based on what i see from the different political ideologies in the political scene ) taking the inheritance law that was recently presented and u can see how divide the street was about . Having one federal gov  to issue important laws then i think the entire system is rdundent .
The second way is dividing the map by area ( north coast south and the internal area ) 
This will include  different states together  but in itself it will create different problems as i imagine some tension will rise between those coalition of those state with the same problem i mentioned above .
I could be wrong in my analysis as i have just wrote it while in the coffee shop (القهوة) but i think what we should advocate is bureaucratic and economic  independence this will help develop the inner states . Now regarding the people and their prejudice that will take time and i don't have an answer to that (😑  am not a ppl person am on reddit )",2019-10-07 19:06:31

Then i decided to publish it to the play store, which required the creation of google developper account and a one time payment of 25$ (i asked a friend of mine who worked abroad to do the payment). Once i got my account, i updated the app and added some ad banners and published it as a free app. Things went really well as i was getting around 10000 downloads per day within a month. I was making around 600$\~1000$ per month depending on the time of the year, and the payments were sent via western union. the app was up for nearly three years before it was took down by google for breaking their rules by distributing data that is protected under copyright, at that time i started my first job so i never looked back to it. May be i got lucky, because at that time there was not much of a competition and android has just started to shine , but i still think that even today the market is really big and you can get some decent income for developping basic apps.",2019-10-08 14:10:35

f3216qz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/deaex0/,2,"here is what i learned after ~12 years of making games 



&gt; keep in mind these aren't 12 of **professional** game making, i am counting since the first day i decided to take the initiative and make a game, i was 13 y.o and used a software called multimedia fusion 2, but i've been making games profressionally since 2013, though i did a couple of small jobs in 2011 for ~$200

&amp;nbsp;

Making games is not your usual money-earning field, to me, becoming a game developer is extremely similar to wanting to become musician or an Actor, **you have** to be truly in love with it, this shouldn't just be your job but it should be your hobby too, i remember when i use to spent almost 13 hours per day during holidays just trying to the collision works properly in my 2D platfomer using Flash. 

&amp;nbsp;

If money is your main purpose, if you are truly not in love with game making, then don't bother, you'll end up giving up, i guarantee that, but if you are into it, if you are one of the few people who actually stick and watch the full credit after your finish a game. 

&gt; when i was a kid i kept reading the credit just to see if there is any arabic names and that will give me a tiny boost of hope, no idea why, but i did it lol


and when you playing, you stop and keep wondering how the the fuck did they achieve this, then yeah, you're in it for a treat.

---------------------

&amp;nbsp;

With that said, i wont deny that everyone needs money, specially in a country like ours, without it you'll live a super shitty miserable life lol, so regarding that, my advice would be: 

* Make your own fun **prototypes** 

* look for clients.

&amp;nbsp;

don't try to publish on your own, you'll fail, you need shitload of money to pay for advertisements and User Acquisitions and even with that, its not guaranteed that you'll make a profit, so yeah, for now, focus on growing up your skills until you reach a point where you can sell those skills, the mobile market is super different from what it was in ~2013 and below, it's almost impossible to see another Flappy Bird hit these days, games need to be extremely polished and well studied, by studied i mean tested for months with bought users (User Acquisitions) then you analyse the results with in-games events and retentions testing, change what you need to change, and test again, and again, etc... 

long story short, you can't publish, you have more luck doing an indie game and putting it on Steam tbh.

&amp;nbsp;

Also, there is one thing that i wish people have told me about 6 years ago, which is being able to do graphics properly, so i highly advice you to learn that skill, being able to design AND program your vision (or your client vision) is a huge skill and it is the main reason why i got my current job, so either learn how to draw or to make 3D (focus with low poly stylzed stuff, don't aim for Uncharted-4 graphics that require a team of 6 professional artist to just make a single character)

&amp;nbsp; 

Your best bet to make money right now is a website called upwork.com, just hope they accept your account cause lately they don't accept anyone.

&amp;nbsp; 

Good luck!",2019-10-09 03:05:38

Dont get me wrong i dont want to go back to stone age but thats not how you develop a country by letting very powerful and shady foreign global players into your country. I dont say lets close like north korea. But we have to be very careful. Furthermore we have many ressources to do most of that on our own. We have nearly 80 000 km2 desert. Enough sun energy to have nearly free electricity. We can build new industries even electric cars. Traditional drives in cars have 1400 pieces, whereas in electric drives only 210. Its an easier technology. We can make smart infrastructure and cities and more. But Tunisians have to do it. Not foreign companies. Because thats how you create good job, how you strengthen the economy/dinar. Then after all that you can make good deals with those companies to get more know-how and make collaborations with them china-style to steal thechnology.",2019-10-12 12:03:24

Just so you know, 13% of Israelis are Arab Muslims. They have Israeli Passports and full legal rights.

The Constitution of Israel states : 

* Israel is a Jewish and Democratic State where religious freedom is guaranteed
* The State of Israel will protect all religious sites on its territory
* All the Citizens of Israel enjoy the same legal and political rights

https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Israel_2013.pdf?lang=en

If you want to see an actual racist ethno-state, look at Saudi Arabia. 

Shias (15% of the populations) are legally discriminated. Non-muslims have been crucified in stadiums.

Over the last 5 years, Saudi Arabia has been bombing Yemen.

85000 children have died, 50000 civilians killed. Saudi Arabia is targeting schools, they are targeting hospitals, they are committing war crimes. This is the largest Humanitarian Crisis since WW2. Over 10 Millions innocent people are now facing famine and death.

 Some would identify as ""culturally Muslim"", and may even conform to a lot of semi-religious social norms to please their families and wider community. 

For others, it's less about the alcohol (Though I've been a non-believer for 11 years, I'm a non-drinker myself) and ""skipping all five prayers"" are only the bare minimum. 

It's about radically alternative lifestyles, which could go against everything our shares cultures stand for. Staring from gender norms, relationships, etc.

I've also read the book: Man' Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl, it made me appreciate the small things I have and gave me some hope.

It is also important not to be alone, to be surrounded by supportive and understanding friends/family.. If you can afford it, I suggest you seek some professional help.

It is okay to be depressed and to admit it, to open up about it, to cry, to let it all out, it happens to men as well as women... It doesn't make you weak or less masculine, it makes you human. This is important to know, because many men are reluctant about getting treated or going through therapy, they want to keep that façade of being a strong independent man who is not emotional and doesn't need that shit. So most men who suffer from mental health issues resort to drugs, violent and self-destructive behaviour, and they're more prone to commit suicide than women. None of that is going to help you, think of depression as a disease, like a virus that attacks your psyche instead of your body. What do you do when you catch a cold? You just need some rest, see a doctor, have people help you and take good care of yourself and it will go away after some time..",2019-11-03 10:03:27

Trump added Venezuela to the list after he got challenged in the courts and one of the argument against his 1st EO is that it was discriminatory against a religious group. So he went ahead and added 2 non-Muslim countries when he issued his 2nd EO. So nice job fox news.

The children of middle class families that work for the state, urging their parents for a government job through nepotism. I’m not saying that the number of people that think this way is rising, it’s on the decline, but it’s still the norm.

That's exactly my point, you better invest the money in educating the bright computer scientists of Tunisia on the topic (and I'm sure there are some) and encourage their research efforts, and they'll be able to create it for their country in a matter of 3 to 4 years, or maybe less. Otherwise, this move is just turning Tunisia into a stupid consumer space,  which is a problem that Arab countries fall into when they start to have some extra money that they don't know how to invest properly, unlike China, which was able to invent its whole stack of technology, even the most sophisticated parts of it, in less than 50 years.

Your comment also made think of one more concern, especially after I read the RT article about this, which is why Russia is proud of deploying this tech in Tunisia and not in Russia itself, that raises some concerns about the safety of this technology.

I hope that you don’t understand my opposition to our democracy, as an argument for dictatorship, I’m far from doing that if you understood me, I’m saying we’re lacking the laws and the institutions to make our democracy less risky. But in the question you asked, you’re probably talking about the people who want to go to full blown dictatorship, because not many make my argument, to those I would say they’re scared to lose the privileges dictatorship gave to them, their relations, the nepotism, the connections, they basically lost their way of life, no matter how messed up that is.",2019-11-16 03:22:19

f7tae7g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/dxm2ud/,2,"First, no journalist should ever be arrested under any circunstance without extremely strong evidence.

Now, Sami Fehri started his career as radio animator. In 2002, his created a company called Cactus Production. It was founded with Belhassen Trabelsi, nephew of the corrupt dictator Ben Ali. He started creating several succesful production like shows like Maktoub. After the Tunisian Revolution, the criminal Trabelsi ran away and the Tunisian State seized 51% of the company. 

Sami Fehri started a private TV Company named Ettounsiya TV with political talk shows. He also did a third season of Maktoub focused on the Ben Ali criminals. He was charged with public money stealing and detained from 2012 to septembre 2013 for his past associations. He is still prosecuted for this. In September 2014 he fusionned Ettounsya TV with El Hiwar Tounsi which he now runs. In the beginning of 2019, The Tunisian Finance Ministry sued him for money laundering and irregular contracts within Cactus Production. The 29th of October, the Courts banned him and his wife from leaving Tunisia. 

On the 5th of November , he has been held for 10 days by a decision of the Prosecutor General. His house and the house of his associates was searched. He has been released but the money laundering charges against him still hold until there is a trial.

I personally believe two things.

A) No one should ever be detained without a fair public trial. Detentions should be exceptional and reserved for cases of murder, violence and terrorism. This guy is not Al Capone. Banning him from leaving Tunisia was enough. If a raid was planned on his house, he should have been detained 2 days, not 10. 

B) The initial charges against him should happen soon or be dropped. You can't sue someone for eternity.",2019-11-17 14:56:46

Women are usually envious about looks especially, their clothes, makeup, hair, nails, their popularity with guys, each others' husbands, how cute their children are... It's like a competition! They even bully and harass each other about it, and might affect professional life. A female boss can be more severe and stricter towards a female employee who she finds to be prettier and younger than her.

Men can also be envious but mostly about properties, money, cars, social status, each others' wives/girlfriends... But honestly, they usually don't mix it with work (from what I've seen).

As for hate, the one I've noticed the most was regionalism. Everyone thinks they're better than someone else from a different region, they compare traditions, foods and dialects (theirs is always the best of course), they have stereotypes about others (Sfaxi is cheap, Sahli is not to be trusted, Jendoubi is backstabber, Tunisois is more educated ...)

The whole phenomenon is new to me tbh and it still fascinates me. I pointed it out one day to my coworkers and my manager, how much people are envious that the atmosphere feels very competitive sometimes, and about regionalism. They said it's a normal thing and quite common in so many workplaces and society itself, even within extended families..

Check 2 groupings: Consumer Goods, and Textile. Consumer Goods are a blanket category and one has to go deeper to see what's in it. But that's ok for now since those 2 categories mostly compete with our local production.

So anyway, you can clearly see the composition of trade, the pourcentage of those 2 categories and who is responsible for making it tougher for our local production.

Another reason would be the cops themselves who decide how many supporters can go to a game.

Sadly there isn't really any straight forward way here, but I hope me and my half-brother's experience might help you out. We had very different approaches. I learnt Fusha, then made a gradual way into Tunisian, starting with some political shows (which mix Fusha and Tunisian) and then entertainment which is mostly a hundred percent Tunisian. He on the other hand just immersed himself in the dialect (it was Morrocan in his case but that isn't too important). He learned some from the internet and just threw himself into conversations with whichever Morrocan he'd meet, asking millions of questions. So which is best? I'd argue his was, he learned much quicker and became an excelent communicator rather fast. The only advantage I have is that I can speak and understand Fusha much better. But if your goal is to only learn the dialect then I'd recommend you do what my brother did. Maybe learn as much as you can on the internet, before taking a long trip to Tunisia. Sadly there isn't much learning matterial for the dialect. I mostly used a pdf of a Tunisian-English dictionary I found online.

Edit: when I come to think of it my brother also learnt Fusha parallel to the dialect for religious reasons, so I don't know if its realistic to SOLELY learn the dialect, but point is, use it alot orally.",2019-11-30 00:05:56

f9l3nmg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/e4adds/,2,"Greetings,

I once took a research class with a University Professor who received his degree from Harvard. Brilliant guy.

He gave people the following advice on find sources and making a great dissertation.

**1)** **Use Zotero**

Zotero is a software that you can install on your computer and on your navigator. It allows to manage your bibliography and your sources very easily. The sources are automatically formated and you can wins tons of time

https://www.zotero.org/

**2)** **Use Encyclopedia sources to build a bibliography**

You want to build a bibliography to do your research. You need a list of articles and book to read. The question is how do you find them and ensure they are the best quality?

The answer is Encyclopedias. The best way to identify a serious source on any field is to look at the general encyclopedia and specialized Encyclopedias. People who write articles in Encyclopedias are usually the best scholars in their fields. Just look up their names and what books they wrote. Also look up what bibliography they use themselves in their books. You can't go wrong with that. 

**3)** **Use an Online Database**

You need to obtain academic papers They are available of things like Google Scholar and J-Store

https://scholar.google.fr/

https://www.jstor.org/

All the quality online research is behind paywalls. The probem is that it's expensive as hell. Generally, Universities offer their students some kind of access. If you don't have access, you can bypass paywalls with this russian site : 

https://whereisscihub.now.sh/

https://sci-hub.tw/

Just past the link of the academic paper and it will give you access.

**4) Use World Cat**

World Cat is very practical for offline research of books. World Cat is a global system that connect major  libraries around the world.  For instance if you live in Kerouan and a book is not available in your local library, it will tell you the closest library in Tunisia where you can find it. Or you can ask the library to borrow it.

https://www.worldcat.org/

**5)** **You can quote newspapers articles from top figures**

You don't have to quote scientific papers if you are quoting a major scholar.

For instance, let's say you work on Islam. Bernard Lewis is considered one of the best expert in the world in Islam. If you want to quote an article Lewis wrote for The Times or The Atlantic, it's okay, because it's Bernard Lewis.

**6)** **Isolate yourself**

You need to isolate yourself when working, otherwise it's much harder. It's the best to shut down your phone and leave it in another room or you in your bag.

I also noticed that Argentinians speak way too fast (I know all Spaniards do but I think Argentinians are the fastest), especially when they're excited and emotional.

My guess is that there are about 2 million Gamers in Tunisia who just don't know their full potential yet, we have some global players who might not know it yet because this country discourages them. This is due to Gaming being wildly seen as something only kids do, which is why you don't see many tournaments happen, and even when they do, they're often for League of Legends or CS:GO. That in itself is not bad, but there are many other games that are wildly played in Tunisia, take, for example, Dota 2, or, Brawlhalla which is a growing game (I, myself have been playing it for 2 years and have peaked at top 20 EU) There are many more examples, but it's just sad that it's just so underlooked by others.

Deny their roots? Define what you mean by roots. Do you mean religion by roots? If that's the case, I'm not bound to believe what my ancestory did. Otherwise it's the genetic fallacy.

If you think tradition = good. Then that's the appeal to tradition fallacy.

Which means you habe no argument as you can not conlcude something is good because it is tradion or because you were brought up in X environment. Another fallacy I see a lot in Tunisia is the appeal to nature.

&gt;even when christianity was the dominat religion people divided and started conflicting within the religion

You don't even need to mention christianity. Shia- sunni wars are as bloody as you can get.

&gt;not deny our history

Nobody is denying history. But we shouldn't view history through emotional lens as it makes us biased. I draw no pride or shame in from history instead I investigate to know what mistakes were done in the past to avoid them.

&gt;I met a lot of atheists who love conflict and fighting as much as the others and hold the darkest hatred toward religion. 

Hatred towards religion isn't hatred towards the people. Muslims=/=islam, christians =/=christianity, jews=/=judaism, etc.

&gt;Let's say 99% of the world is non religious do you believe conflict will stop ? cause i dont.

I agree. But there will be less. And we would stop having some tunisians following random terrorist imams. The belief in heaven and hell contributes in terrorism persisting in Tunisia and accross the muslim majority countries.",2019-12-09 23:44:03
facfdqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/e87l6u/,2,"&gt;Cant you just talk without calling anyone a terrorist ? 

I call a spade a spade. Deny the problem, and you'll pay the price. Actually, sorry, you're not the one who will die fighting those terrorists. And I didn't call a specific imam a terrorist, I said they're here. Maybe should I remind you that they're recruited in religious circles. It's very naive to deny that.

&gt;Tunisian atheists think atheism is hate on religion 24/7.

Because they lack education on the terms and tunisians in general don't understand atheism.

Atheism isn't anti-theism. And don't generalize about all atheists that's bigotry. What you're saying is like :""tunisian muslims think islam is cutting the hand of thiefs"". That's an overgeneralization. Do you like it when I say that?

The only sentence that can follow ""tunisian atheists"" is ""don't believe in god.""

&gt;Things are not as simple as tradition=good, and traditions are not just religion it's the way tunisians do stuff if you lived your whole life locked in your room having no tunisian identity in you how about you dont talk about our traditons and stop calling anything you dont understand a fallacy.

And how about stopping act smart and actually educate yourself on what logical fallacies are? I understand what you say, and I don't call something I don't understand a fallacy.

And sorry for you, I don't live my life locked in a room. And there's no correlation between tunisian identity and being locked in a room. I'm born and lived in banzart, love it or hate, I'm tunisian. Eating mlewi more often doesn't make you more tunisian. Otherwise make a tatoo on your face if you're a woman, be more tunisian.

Here are some fallacies if you want to learn logic : https://www.logicalfallacies.org

&gt;And again lack of knoweldge if you read just a little bit of history you will realize than christian-christian wars outnumber shiaa sunni wars by a huge amount and by far caused more casualties. It's just the shia sunni conflict is more recent.

They caused more casualities because they were here for longer time and have more followers. 2000 for christianity, 1400 for islam. And in Tunisia there's not a lot of christians, most people are muslims. Islam is more relevent to Tunisian issues than chrsitianity. So why allways speak bad about christianity and good about islam? This double standard poisons all discussions about religions in Tunisia.

Wife beating : ""christians beat their wives""

Terrorism : "" christians did more victims ""

LGBT issue : "" everybody perscutes them, why don't we get to do it? ""

Etc.

And don't accuse me of lack of knowledge. I know christian history, and how they poison politics in the west better than you do. But they're not relevent to our politics.

&gt;Just an advice: Stop acting like you figured the whole universe out and speak with a little bit of modesty especially when you're so clueless about history.

Just an advice : first, before you advise me about modesty deal with your arrogance. You litterally concluded I lack knowledge because I disagree with you.

Second, learn how to use logic, I didn't say fallacy because ""I don't understand"", you're just making excuses to flatter your ego as you can not possibly have made a fallacy right!?",2019-12-10 00:40:25

fakscum,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/e970a3/,2,"I can agree with that, I thought you were just dismissing what our people went through and go through. You're right, the post colonial powers will NEVER admit their past transgressions, and still continue to refer to their nations as 'Great' etc, and revel in their imperial 'glory days'. 

I do actually agree that the only thing we can do now is make our countries better and rise above it, but we shouldn't forget or just brush the past under the rug. My, and I'm sure your, grandparents, were born as second class citizens in their own country, that's still raw for me. 

Do you know what reaaally grinds me though, the fact that English and French particularly, go on about how they won the world wars and 'saved the world', but they never even aknowledge how many Africans and Asians died fighting for their backwards empires. North African brigades were amongst the fiercest and bravest soldiers, who shed blood for France, and what do we get in return... Crumbling French buildings and a power vacuum that gets filled by dictators 

In general though, I don't think Tunisians/North Africans share your sentiment, simply because there are still people alive who lived through the colonial shit storm. 

Imagine I came to your house, ate all your food, took all your clothes, jewellery, raped your daughter, killed your son, took your basic rights away, then set your house on fire. Then you come to my house and politely ask if you can borrow some sugar to sweeten your coffee, so I laugh and shut the door in your face. That's what the French did to us, and I think people are so beaten down and exhausted that many just can't be bothered to make their country better, when it's easier to just move somewhere with better opportunity.",2019-12-12 17:39:02

Plus they have the worst company policies, you have to wait 408 days to reply to their compensation claim with another 254 days to pay up if required by the court. My family had given up once when their flight was cancelled. You can check all the reviews people have had with them to get a sense as to how bad they are doing.

fax525e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/eaifol/,2,"**Canadian Indian residential school system**

In Canada, the Indian residential school system was a network of boarding schools for Indigenous peoples. The network was funded by the Canadian government's Department of Indian Affairs and administered by Christian churches. The school system was created for the purpose of removing Indigenous children from the influence of their own culture and assimilating them into the dominant Canadian culture, ""to kill the Indian in the child."" Over the course of the system's more than hundred-year existence, about 30 per cent of Indigenous children (around 150,000) were placed in residential schools nationally. The number of school-related deaths remains unknown due to an incomplete historical record, though estimates range from 3,200 upwards of 6,000.The system had its origins in laws enacted before Confederation, but it was primarily active from the passage of the Indian Act in 1876.

Small donations only? So you have a party, the biggest party since OP said that you have the majority, so you’re gonna be able to get the biggest share of donations, and you are telling us you’re going to say no to MONEY? What kind of person would refuse to put money in his pocket? Can’t even take you seriously right now. Digitalizing bureaucracy would take a big budget, sending IT students to study abroad, and then giving them big paychecks to make them comeback would take an even bigger budget, again you’re telling us you would take money out of your own pocket, well in this case you’re going to tax the people even more or start an austerity policy that would make the people sacrifice their current way of living, you think the people would let you do that? And do you think you’re able to convince them that this is good for them? Also this will make you lose all your parliament chairs and prime minister to someone who’s willing to do what I wrote (read my comment on this post). Most of the big fishes in tax evasions hold multiple nationalities, and they’re basically the back bone of the relationship between us and that first world country, they control that country’s interest in ours, through large companies, in communications or manufacturing or constructions ... do you think people before didn’t try to do that? Are you willing to start some sort of economic war, right when we took major loans from the IMF? If you fight corruption in state companies, the unions would stop everything you do, even jeopardize our youths future by targeting their education, well you can’t even fight corruption to be honest, they’ll even force you to recruit even more useless personal or again, they’ll shut down everything. How are you going to dictate what goes in and out of our market when we can’t even secure our borders, and I’m not talking illegal routes, I’m talking straight up legal shipments from the ports, I mean watch how we bring in the thrift shop clothings, it’s a joke.

It asked users to input the price of gasoline for stations as they went to fill up. Then it would map out all the stations and their prices so people could get the lowest prices. It “rewarded” people by giving them points for updating the price, much like reddit gives you karma. The points would give you badges and rankings but weren’t monetary. Essentially people liked using the app because they could find the price and would contribute back because it would help them too. I could see it working with the metro/bus lines too. You are waiting in Passage and open the app to see the next #2 train coming to Passage, the app was updated by another user 2 min ago in Barcelona saying the #2 train was leaving the station. The app knows it’s a typical 6 min ride between Barcelona and Passage, it tells you the train should be there in 4 min. You look around and see a #4 metro leaving Passage and a #5 arriving from Barcelona. You update those trains in the app (#4 leaving Passage, #5 arriving Passage) and get 2 “karma” or points. Congrats you just unlocked the “train conductor badge” for contributing 100 train updates. The people waiting for those trains further down the line get an updated arrival time.

I will talk in English now purely for utilitarian reasons (it helps me get my ideas across very easily /quickly). 

While your heart may be in the right place, you failed to make the critical distinction between ""bad faith actors"" and well intentioned Tunisian who are very critical and rightfully vocal about the situation.

Having worked with people from all kinds of nationalities, I realized at some point that our struggles are not so different, and in a way, we are all mirrors to one another. 

We help eachother create/find/optimize our visions for our respective countries by sharing our so called ""dirty laundry.""

Another problem area with your argument is that it infringes upon people's freedom of speech. What you are suggesting is merely a temporary bandaid to a long term problem/struggle. It just doesn't work. The foundation and the precedent you want to set are shaky at best, and draconian at worst.

Think of China as an example.

Few thinkers and philosophers have had people crying from Moscow, to London, to San Francisco when they died. Most of his critics have actually never read him. Marx constantly denounced and hated authoritarianism. What Marx called the ""dictatorship of Proletariat"" only referred to the 1870 Commune de Paris workers insurrection against the French Elites. His analysis of Capitalism, Religion, Elites and Globalization remains incredibly accurate. I honestly believe that if you have not read Marx, you can not understand the world that we live in""*

She stutter than said : He's French,they don't speak Arabic genius..

I said : Than they're the stupid ones,they should learn some Tunisian before they visit

She muttered something and change the subject..

If Tunisians were proud of their language like Japanese,Russians,French people...etc it will be a better place,people won't look down at us,tourist will try to speak some of our language and share to the world,foreigners will feel like we're a big deal not some another stupid third world country ! so they're forced to  put some effort before they live here

When i was in the United State no one knew where i came from, when i said Tunisia they think i'm from Tennessee so i said i'm from north Africa a small country called Tunisia,they laughed it off and say how i'm white lol,well i don't blame them, when we have those snowflakes who complain constantly to foreigners about their daily struggle and suck their dick for some cash instead of telling them about our history,culture and show a good image..

Schools play a big part here but suddenly ,nowadays if you don't speak French in TUNISIA you'll be derided by the North Africans Arab people..if just people change their mentality !!!

The TND was overvalued for a long time because of the corruption by Ben Ali.  When he was in power it was 1USD to like 1.4TND.  Do you really think the TND was that close to being as powerful on the world stage as the USD?  Absolutely not.  For the longeset time they have been saying the TND would hit 1USD to 3.0TND.  It's at 2.95 now and it's been slowing up since it's gotten closer.  It'll get to 3 and probably 3.2 but probably bounce between 3.1 to 3.2 for a long time.  

Maybe look at your government and the businesses here.  There needs to be a mandated cost of living increase by the government across all sectors of at least 10-15%.

I think you're making this mods issue a bit bigger than what it actually is, I didn't really see any internal  problems between mods tbh, maybe it happened before or I didn't pay attention to it, but I don't think any major problems persist between mods to the point where they could affect the subreddit negatively.

Concerning commitment, for my part personally I must be honest and say that I sometimes forget that I'm even a mod on here :3 but I do try and keep it clean by deleting spam or insulting threads/messages, other than that I'm not really that active on the subreddit, I'm more present on the chat so I may miss some stuff on here.

I would like to liven up the subreddit and see it become more active, but like the others said, that's not really the mods' ""job"", it's the community that makes the content, that's the whole point of reddit, mods are here to keep everything clean and in check, we can also help to grow the subreddit by creating special threads and events and stuff but like anyone can do that and talk with the mods to make a sticky thread or something so you know, it's a group effort I guess.",2019-03-12 19:00:11

One thing is for sure mods eventhough they are seemingly i nactive they are still lurking around and monitoring closely how things are evolving ;) I saw this community getting lot more people in with time but at some point no one was really making ""popular posts"" because we did not have many active redditors on this subreddit and of course lack of popularity among tunisians. 

I believe you had very specific issues with mods and it is ok to not see eye to eye to the way you would envision how this subreddit should be but if you would really like to make it  bigger/ more popular subreddit, Let's start of by not putting the blame entirely on the mods.  Each had their own way of helping making this a better community.  ",2019-03-13 02:51:33

It inevitably create a conflict of interest ( or at least alludes to that ) when such senior officials make or speak out on policies that relate to their second country  . 

Picture this : A french Tunisian Industry minister decides in 2014 to extend the contract for the french company exploiting salt . Now he might have decided that in favor of his second country **Or** he could have done that simply because he genuinely thought it was the best option for the country he was currently minister in But let me tell you something : It doesn't matter because the Tunisians will almost definitely think he was working for the French which will result in riots and him / the whole cabinet being changed .

Personally, I wouldn't send anything there. The customs agents are completely corrupt. The country is full of thieves at every level and in every position. Of course there are many honest and good people but you cannot know that a good person will be handling your package. There are NO CONSEQUENCES for corruption in Tunisia so a lot of people think to themselves, ""Why not steal?"" since they know that really nothing will happen to them if they are caught. They won't be fired. They won't got to jail. Everybody around them is stealing as well so it is only the rare decent person who doesn't want to join the party and get rich by stealing as well.

Anyway, why do you need to send something? What do they need that they can't buy there for themselves? I hope it is not somebody trying to take advantage of you.",2019-03-16 00:38:45

eitslgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/b0na1t/,1,"I was born in the UK to parents from the USSR. Neither countries allow me to renounce the citizenship I had at birth. I do not (morally/emotionally) pledge allegiance to either states. I do not like what the UK has become and as a tax-payer in and member of the Tunisia, I feel myself more attached to this country - one that has taken me in, given me a good life and one that I now have in-laws in, than any man-made state that I am in any way related to by means of travel documents.

Poor people use passports to guarantee their belongingship to a larger economy or a safer/better place for them and their children. Rich people have more than one passport as a Plan B. Syrian politicans and businessmen (who were and are safe throughout this war) have had their travel abilities impeded by sticking to only one passport. Had one of these businessmen or politicans had, say, a French passport, they would be able to ask for France's help in being evacuated to a safe place and would have (due to the EU) the undeniable freedom to travel freely in the other 27 memberstates and visit countries like Canada and the US without the need for a visa.

Having a French passport does not mean that they or their children even possess the French language (a bad example in the case of Tunisia where most people I come across speak *at least* elimentary French) nor does it mean that they serve France's interests. It could be mutually unbeneficial for France to have people under it's belt who only call on it for help but do nothing to improve the country - as is the case with most expats living outside of their countries of citizenship.

Then, there are people who serve America/Russia/Israel/China's interests without spending significant time in these countries. An envelope with cash inside and instructions shows up on their workdesk and they do as they are told.

What matters is not about where a person is from or who he or she is on paper, but the person's actions.",2019-03-18 20:26:19
eittun5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/b1u0jb/,1,"First of all, one must be mentally ill to go on the type of vacation that the guy took in Turkey and the Balkans prior to planning this trip. He was ideologically inspired. Maybe he doesn't have a **mental-illness* mental-illness, but like smelling feet or peeking in showers, his hinges must be *a bit* off to prepare and carry out what he did.

Second of all, while each and every life is dear and a gift from God, most 'white people' (and the leaders that represent them) feel little empathy for someone who has no relationship to them dying - same goes for Muslims, blacks, Jews, gays. You'll say ""oh no"" in front of your friends, but deep down, you aren't as moved as you would be if you came home to your parents slaughtered in their bed... to give a radical example... Muslims in Egypt are not protesting against the slaughter of Copts - and you know, we don't expect them to...

What Muslims envision this to be is a the beggining of a purge of Muslims. I assure you, if ""we"" wanted Muslims gone, there is very little Muslims would be able to do to stop this.

Instead, why don't the Muslims look into their own communities. A non-Muslim is 140 times more likely to die at the hands of a Muslim than vice-versa. We, Christians, do not hear about what your fellow co-religionists do to our believers... simply for believing in Christianity, on our news. Why would we react profoundly to a mad-man's (natural, albeit excessive) counter action/reaction?

I am in no way saying that is the fault of some Turkish tourists or Saudi students in New Zealand that some madman decided to kill them, but a reaction similar to the one that the Muslim world is showing now, but in solidarity with Christians killed by Muslims, would go a long way. Being the ""adult"" having the moral ground and trying to stop the violence instead of demanding a raise in government handouts, 60"" TVs, 72 virgins for each Muslim, etc, would do Muslims worldwide a much bigger favour in the long run

And, the reaction by the leaders/senators of Australia and New Zealand highly reflect the opinions of the citizens of these countries. European and North American leaders (minus Trump, sometimes) are turning a blind eye to the mass terrorism that is happening on their own soil and in other parts of the world where people share our values (Christianity, etc). What the Australians and NZers are saying should come at no surprise: they are simply saying that which Europeans would be narrating if it wasn't punishable with hate crime laws in the old continent.",2019-03-18 20:40:58

The one that is I guess the most active is in Zaghouan , it is run by an association the [ASEZ](http://www.speleo-tunisie.com/escalade/), you also have Association Jeunes Nomades, Association des Sports de Montagne et d'Ecologie.

Now for gyms it s hard to find one that specific but I would think that if you reach out to communities and clubs on their facebook pages for example they might be able to help you find one.

There is one in La soukra called Vitatop but it offers a variety of activities mainly for young teenages/kids, they might know of a rock climbing gym available for adults as well.

Just Hang in there, you will find what you are looking for!

""I wish I could find an American girl"" he said, nothing new there, they always seem to think I can find them a wife, but then he went on ""but the problem with foreign women is non of them are virgins, the have sex with tons of men before they get married."" 

At this point I looked up at him and in the glow of the street lamp I saw him: mid 40's, overweight, huge glasses that made his eyes look like dinner plates, thinning hair. I usually don't judge someone on the way they look but he was by no definition a good catch. 

""Are you married?"" I ask

""Not yet"" he says "" inchallah, soon.""

""Women in America don't have the same culture as Tunisian women,"" I say, ""we are free to live the way we wish. There are women who wait for marriage in America, but they would never move to another country to get married and most of them are ""super"" Christians, so most likely they would find your religion intolerable. ""

""It is a sin to have sex before marriage."" At this point I got a bit upset. He had said sex twice, to a married woman alone with him in the car as he tried to convince me American women were immoral, what a hypocrite!

So I told him that women in America learned along time ago to taste the milk before they buy the cow. What if the cow was too old to make milk? What if the cow was too aggressive or had a bad temper? What if the cow didn't fit in her stable or was a selfish fucking lover? 
I told that divorcing three partners so you can find the right person seems like a bad deal; skip the marriage and be sure before you legally commit. 

I went on for a while...when I'm revved up it's hard for me to stop talking. When I was done he said. "" I think its cultural."" ",2019-03-21 07:37:32

Le français est la langue officielle de 6 pays en Europe (qui partage presque la même culture judéo-chrétienne), un pays en Amérique, et 21 pays en Afrique (sur 54) qui partage la même histoire coloniale mais pas la culture.

On enseigne dès le jeune age la langue ""administrative"" (ou officielle pour certain pays) avant même la langue universelle qui est l'anglais. Ce choix n'est pas innocent, mais souvent imposé (par de programme de réforme, d'éducation et d'aide humanitaire) par la France suite à des dettes, financement des projets internes ou parfois des ""dons"" (je veux pas rentrer dans le sujet de la corruption au sein des pays africain).

L'enseignement de la langue française favorise l'échange avec l'europe certes. Mais l'europe dans le cas de ces pays c'est la France. Ce qui freine le développement économique (peu d'investissement -industriel- étranger, marché externe limité, etc...)

Aussi le français limite les choix des africains, pour faire des études, chercher des partenaires ou même accéder aux ressources (d'information, scientifiques ou culturelles) en langue étranger, qui deviennent très limités.

Les africains doivent se libérer de cet instrument qui les enchaines et s'émanciper en élargissant leurs perspectives: en reformant en particulier le système éducatif et en retrouvant leurs identités perdu pendant l'ère de colonisation.

Don't get it confused, being gay here, is illegal.  There are Tunisian men who have been forced to have anal exams here (still legal here) and jailed for being gay.

Though, I seriously doubt they would do that to a foreigner, you never know what kind of trouble the police would want to cause.  You can be with your s/o but you need to know this is a Muslim country and that being gay here, is still illegal and not accepted by the majority here.

I also learned, in general, that I have a lot of heavy clothes that I could replace with very lightweight ones. this is great even for just daily life, it makes me feel freer to feel more lightweight bc I'm no longer wearing heavy clothes, but espeically great for travel.   So I bought a very lightweight, packable coat instead, it gets very tiny and weighs so little and is very warm. I will make sure to only bring lightweight clothes, I can always just rewear the same few things. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is so enocuraging to hear that you never check bags. But do you go to see family when you go to Tunisia? Maybe you do bc you stuff pockets!

&amp;#x200B;

My husband is osessed with giving them  a lot of gifts (which drives me crazy because we are not wealthy) and bringing an extra bag so we already bought the Turkish Air ticket, then after we did I realized - we could have just bought gifts that are lightweight (like how I can have a 10 pound coat, or a .5 oz coat :-) Same function, but much lighter weight. So I will enforce this next time. But NOW I know I can also put gifts into a coat with deep pockets, this is BRILLIANT!!

I read some of your posts and I feel like it could be me writing them (minus the Tunisia knowledge :-)  We live in NYC, one of the most expensive cities in the world, and are spending a lot on going there. I am like - they will never come to the US, this gift giving thing has to have its limits. When I was a kid going to Europe to see my family, they all automatically assumed I was rich because I lived in the US (wrong!) when I traveled cross the US, people in other states assumed I was rich bc I was from NYC (also wrong.) So I think the bringing of tons of gifts encourages that very incorrect attitude, and I don't like it. Maybe I am too frugal. My husband seems upset by this but i have to remind him of our current economic reality. And also that we are taking over a month of our lives to go there.

&amp;#x200B;

I notice his Tunisian friends in the US are a little stiffer around me than my Americn male friends, but it's like a shyness. I am not a people gazer so I probably won't run into the same troubles are you.  I have interpreted his friendz' slight stiffness as respect, and as a not being used to how to interact with me,  I thnk the more they interact with me over time, the more comfortable they have gotten ith hugging me, just as I hve gotten comfortable with kissing my French friends 2-3 times. Hopefully we will all come to learn each other's ways but I will be sure to be mindful when I am there. 

&amp;#x200B;

We won't give knives as gifts, that's great to know!

&amp;#x200B;

 your point about people eating from spoons and then putting those saliva covered spoons/forks back into the dish was incredibly important. I tend not to realize things like tht and I was so grateful you spelled it out, because I have celiac and anothr chronic health condition where if I get a cold or a flu, my autoimmune condition goes into overdrive. I have to be more mindful of these things and your being so detailed, I can' tell you how helpfu tht was, that cemented it into my brain. If I see there is a problem I will say I am not hungry. 

&amp;#x200B;

We will have to do researchon celiac friendly places, if I can buy dairy free food there, etc. In the US I am used to amazon fresh, lots of dairy and gluten free options. Not sure how plentiful they will be there....

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway thank you so much! and  I will definitely bring TP :-) PS my husband says he heard tht since the revolution, customs corruptoin isn't as bad, but I don't know. Someone else posted they use TNT or DHL and gets insurance.  I can get quotes and see...another avenue to explore. But I love love love your coat idea. and also reducing the expectation of gifts, especially if we;ll be going yearly, at several thousands of dollars a year expense to us.

So After gaining independence in 1950s it made Vietnamese the official language which everything was conducted whether be science, education or business.

Another thing is Vietnam went through 20+year long wars from French independence to the American invasion to the conquest of South Vietnam. despite all that today Vietnam has better literacy rate then Tunisia and is one fastest growing economies of the world. By getting rid French early on it showed that you can educate your people are educated in their own language.

http://bit.do/eNGoG The owner is called ""Sami"", I don't know him or if he is even there but that's what the restaurant is called to help you find it, definitely recommend trying a bunch of stuff there I eat the sandwiches there personally reasonable prices and tasty food I think it's a good start

I think this one is decent too ( similar place but I think you can find some good dishes like kamounia etc, don't expect a fancy place but food is pretty good)

http://bit.do/eNGpi

I'm not the most knowledgeable about eating out sorry but that should at least leave you with a good taste

I highly recommend going to the last two just for the food, and choose from the rest for places to try at least and take some photos haha",2019-04-07 17:52:07

ekbzd7s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/bahaud/,1,"I'm dumb forgot you don't know the dishes beforehand, so for Djerba I think I'd go about it this way

Breakfast stuff at Himdan http://bit.do/eNGyG, if you don't want to try something ""basic"" (like the tuna sandwich) I'd personally go with juice/Lben(basically fermented milk, tastes good)/yogurt whichever you prefer (you should try Lben/raieb basically the same thing) and a honey+Gouta (basically ricotta) sandwich. You can also buy the fricassé from there (but maybe not for breakfast haha, it's fried stuff a bit too heavy imo)

Lunch at one of the ones in my other comment

Lablebi you can either try at the ""Sami"" one I mentioned earlier or this one (this is the one I prefer http://bit.do/eNGzU it's that blue door near the S sign thingy) right in front of it there's another one that's well known (mainly for sandwiches) called Saad el Maleh

For Briks and ""tunisian plate""(basically a salad with tuna) I'd go to this one called belgasem http://bit.do/eNGAR if you follow that road you'll find it on your right hand it's pretty close but there's no google maps there

For pastry you can try this one http://bit.do/eNGA7

If the restaurants I mentioned earlier don't do mloukhia try this one http://bit.do/eNGBB it's not particularly good but it isn't too bad either

Dishes I generally recommend Couscous (obvious), Djerbian Rice (rice with steamed veggies and meat), Mloukhia, Grilled fish or fish in general (also obvious, try this one http://bit.do/eNGCo really cool spot), Market jilbena bil shoubay (basically tomato sauce with greens peas and shoubay kind of like a small octopus thingy), There's also a good octopus salad at the Malibu restaurant I mentioned earlier, kefteji (go to the sami one does it pretty well)

Also street stuff the others mentioned chapati and Mlawi definitely try them they're cheap and taste great. Don't know a place in particular they're pretty basic I don't think anyone can fuck up making those

If you're feeling adventrous you can try Hergma, basically a tomato sauce with stuff from sheep https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejAwcw-oJ34 it tastes VERY strong I don't like it personally)

Food is definitely one of the only things we do right so you'll have tons of fun I'm sure of it, hope I didn't forget something important",2019-04-07 19:08:31

I would say it is mainly because of the perspective they have of professionnalism. They don't know how to separate the professional from the personal feelings, and end up behaving like shit. 
Most of the People are frustrated, from the bus driver to the policeman, all of them will try to find a reason to get into a fight, and would Create any possible excuse to impose his/her powers on you.
People in Tunisia do not smile to strangers (unless you are pretty or well dressed), they judge you on how you look or how you speak, they would tell you that your request is illegal or that the system is down (because the operation requires a lot of work), and will hate the fact that you are in a better position than them. 
A manager will also transfer all his/her frustration on you. A manager will not give you a grade based on your professional performances or your accomplishments, but will more 'judge' you as a person, and depending on how (s)he likes you.
The same applies with Administrative Employees, and will make up any new paper just to piss you off, or to make you come again. The same applies to the Policeman, who stops you (because it's 1 am and that he is bored) and threatens to fine you for a random (invalid) reason.

I say, if you have a job, you have to do it, as per the books, or fuck off and let serious people doing it.
I also think We have to train people on doing their jobs correctly (trying to be solution oriented), and how to separate the personal feelings from the ones you should have at work.",2019-04-23 22:34:23

That same evening ghannouchi came out on TV to tell those who demanded for shariaa law that Ennahdha is a modern party, and they actually won't apply sharia law.
My friend was deeply disappointed and stopped voting for them (despite not removing that utterly ugly beard without mustache).

Also, they have been pushing for laws that will compensate for what happened to their activists (yaani, you're not being an activist to get paid, are you?).

I feel like their priorities are not straight. I genuinely hate them, I'm really sorry for this negativity, I just hate hypocrites.
Mind you, back in the 80s, Ghannouchi praised Sudan and middle easterns wahabis. However, guess where he went for exile? ENGLAND. if he actually went to Sudan or Saudi Arabia I'd have been more understanding of his actions.

embyv95,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/bjf6vd/,1,"Being able to defend yourself isn't any better than not being able to defend yourself until you need to defend yourself.

For example, the Jews in Europe were living in a pretty peaceful and fairly safe place until the State turned on them and decided to take all their belongings and round them up to put them in death camps. 

That is the purpose of the Second Amendment in America. The intention of it is primarily that the citizens have the ability to fight the government if it becomes tyrannical and then secondarily that they can defend themselves against somebody who intends them bodily harm. 

How the US is better is that people who want to defend themselves in their own home here have a very effective means of doing that. People save their own lives and the lives of their families every single day in America using a fire arm. 

We also have criminals and mentally ill people who have guns here both legally and illegally. That is unfortunate and I think we have to be tougher here about taking guns out of the hands of those people and punishing them for their crimes.

emtch5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/bltkv4/,1,"Well the weather has been kind of unpredictable lately, like some times it would be hot, others it would be cold so I would advise you to bring with you clothes that are appropriate for both cases.

 As far as modesty, I always see tourists and foreigners walking around wearing whatever, shorts, mini skirts, etc. You sill you wanna dress modestly though ( not too much skin, jeans are ok, not too short shorts, skirts and dresses) just in case so you won't encounter any problems. 

For now however you wanna avoid showing too much skin and wear modest clothes because it's the month of ramadhan, meaning some people are fasting and you might wanna respect them through dressing modestly and not eating in front of them. I mean there are some coffee shops and restaurants that are open but it's preferable not to eat in public, just in those places or in the privacy of your own home. I am telling you this to avoid being stared at because most people will be fasting and they will find it kind of unusual to see someone eating during the day. 

There isn't much you can do during the day in Ramadan because like I said people are fasting and most places are closed at night however it's the total opposite. You also wanna be careful and hold close your bags, expansive gadgets (phone, laptop, camera..) because there are some pickpockets so you always wanna be careful.

So yeah, that's it, enjoy your stay in Tunisia and if you have any other questions I'd be pleased to answer them for you :)",2019-05-08 09:09:06

There are a lot of countries where there are a lot of ethnic Chinese who settled there so you have Chinese ancestors but you could live anywhere and you could be mixed with a little bit of some other type of ancestry but definitely you are not mixed with any white or black.

I think you should put the flag inside his eyes instead. Just the moon and star I mean. So inside each eye, put the moon and star from the Tunisian flag. That would look really cool.

Like this but do it better than me. (I am drawing it with my finger so it is sloppy.) But I think you will need to make his eyes a different color. Maybe do a black outline for the outside circle of the eye, then do the eyes white with a red moon and star.

I would recommend studying as much as possible at night as it is easier to do so with a full stomach. And if that isn't enough, you can add two or so hours in the morning. As for the subjects, main ones should be given the utmost importance and a significant portion of your time and effort, but don't commit the mistake of leaving the other unattended as they can lift your score pretty high. And remember, the bac exam isn't going to be difficult at all. It'd quite attainable and easy. But the hard part is keeping yourself together and controlling your stress. If you manage to focus and not freak out, I'm sure you'll do great.
Good Luck.",2019-05-17 23:51:06

eo53xkd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/bpn2nc/,1,"Despite the fact that evolution is unpredictible, your explanation of history according to physics and mechanical principles is surprisingly awesome. It’s what one may call as an oscillatory evolution.

As for Archemedes and Israel :
Whether in Tunisia or else where meddling in countries affairs during elections or influencing the course of their histories, was, still is and will always remain very common to achieve geopolitical goals. 

Yet, although media in Tunisia did not stop commenting facebook allegations against Archimedes, no real proof was given to strengthen the conclusion according to which israeli secret services were behind such a company. 

But this does not mean that Israel would be disinterested of the Tunisian case especcially when taking into account its unicity in the Middle East and North Africa region. 

But should one blame Israel which –at least officially– is still considered as an enemy?! 

What about brotherly and friendly countries ?! Are they just saints ?! 

Voltaire once said My god keep me from my friends, as for my enemies I am in charge.

Actually as a result of the 2011, there are several deficiencies, which  among other challenges have led to political corruption.

To me Macron’s election is unsual because this is the first time in France history since WWII that the president does not come from one of the 2 biggest political parties. It’s also relevant to notice that he is a new comer in politics unlike all previous presidents.",2019-05-19 18:25:19

eof1yx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/bpxxv3/,1,"Been there, done that... 
Trust me it looks intimidating but once it's done you'll see how easy the bac exam can be... I studied in a ""lycée Pilote"" too and I KNOW it can be really stressful with everybody gathering last minute exercices and making copies of every exam they get their hands on... But it's all for show, most of the people who had done that ended up with a way lesser score than mine. I'd suggest not to get more exams or exercices than you already have, just stick with what you have. (trust me it's plenty). Review those and don't bother with the things you know, just go straight for that exercice you know you had problems with or that formula you never got to understand. 

Positivity and confidence is everything and you'll have people around you trying to take that away from you. Heck, I even had a friend who called me every morning to brag about how much she revewed the day prior just in case I needed more stress piled onto me! But don't let this get to you, if someone is bothering you like that, don't pick up the phone, people can be toxic even those who are the closest to you!

And my biggest advice is don't let anyone fool you into thinking that they have leaks and that such and such subject will be on the exam! Don't even trust your professiors (I've had a professior tell us he had leaks and everyone jumped on it and kept circulating the rumors but as expected it ended up being all wrong) , if someone tells you they know what will be on the exam then they don't have you best intrest in mind.

eonq18w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/bs0bag/,1,"\&gt;  Why did the French have stronger impact on the countries they colonized compared to countries that the English colonized? 

&amp;#x200B;

Britain  does not want ""woke"" or ""enriched"" Arabs. It took what it could get from it's Arab colonies and didn't send Brits to mix with the local populations. Indians were used as slave labour, then and there in India. France moved it's population into Algeria, making Algeria an extension of France, and Tunisians, being naturally open-minded and receptive of foreigners (Tunisia being like Hong Kong of the Mediteranean) and wanting to learn, took from the (at the time) technologically more advanced French, took what they could from them and made Tunisia what is is today, and not the more Arab, untouched-by-outside-influences Libya.

&amp;#x200B;

France didn't like the ""outdated""/""archaic"" traditions (like Polygamy) in Mayotte and so it outlawed it and fought fiercly to root it out. The Brits did and continue to do anything to appease Muslims - see grooming gangs in the UK, 30k confirmed terrorists in central London alone, etc. The French were harsher than the British, and wanted subjects, whereas the UK, imo, left the primitive peoples to their own ways and only used them as labour.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;  they teach English as main foreign language while all of education in their native languages 

&amp;#x200B;

Indian universities do not teach medicine in their native languages. I assure you, universities in foreign British colonies are conducted in English. Even in Malta and Cyprus - fully independent, non-subdued ""colonies"".",2019-05-24 17:25:08

Music is allowed and even during the past Caliphates, there is no verse nor a hadith that says that Music is Haram, in case you didn't know, even ISIL, the terrorist group, have their own kind of Music

Alcohol isn't accepted here, most Tunisian are religious even if many drink alcohol and from my experience, i have cousins who drink it and feel guilty and acknowledge that it's Haram and want to stop drinking it, this is the case for the most alcohol consumers i know

eoxw3wh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/bs0bag/,1,"I speak as Muslim From country that was colonized by the French and I can tell you one thing for sure if I was colonized I would rather be colonized by the British. at least allowed locals to govern themselves in lot of the matters. By doing this they gave locals important state building experience. They also built local institutions that survived after they left. The French were more racist in the sense they wanted to shove down their culture, language etc on everyone. The British were smarter and more cunning. They didn’t practice overt control rather they used more of indirect control methods such as empowering natives and locals to do their work.

Terrorism effects Muslim countries regardless of who colonized them. Secondly Lebanon was the mother of sectarian problems in the Middle East in the first place. Yet they were colonized by the French. To this day Lebanon doesn’t have democracy as they’re system is based on rather sectarianism. Also Algeria and Morocco are homogeneous when it comes to religion. 99 of them are Muslims so of course they won’t have problems with minorities because minorities don’t exist there. Also how come Bangladesh and Pakistan no matter messed up they’re inherited a system of governance from the British that included elections, constitution universities etc. whereas French colonized Algeria, Morocco, Lebanon didn’t have single universities that the French built in those countries that still functioning today.",2019-05-27 04:03:33
eoy66g5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/bs0bag/,1,"Wow so many fallacies and inaccuracies. First of I’m Syrian-American so next time don’t 
assume my identity. I don’t speak French and I don’t seek to learn it. Secondly I agree you on that Tunisia wouldn’t be the same without the European influence which is true, but to attribute its secularism and laws to France is a mistake. I mean Bourguiba was more inspired by Ataturk of turkey and his reforms then France. So if I were you I wouldn’t overplay the French had on his life. if you think Tunisia success is due to French you’re surely mistaken. Morocco was also colonized by the French yet they have regressive laws.
I mean look all the former French colonies in Africa and compare them to British ones and you will see the difference. 

Secondly your example of Afghanistan as British colonialism is flawed. Afghanistan was protectorate of the Britain which meant that Britain had control over their foreign affairs only and other  than that Afghanistan was practically independent and by 1921 it became a fully independent sovereign state.Contrast that with France who fought tooth and nail in Vietnam and Algeria in 1950s and 1960s in order to keep them subjugated. Yet we have examples of Britain giving countries  independence early as 1921. Which just shows the difference between the French and the British.

All I have to say is that unlike you I despise all forms of imperialism and colonialism yet that at same I’m a realist which means I can acknowledge the fact the British were more lenient and freedom loving then savage murdering French who’s racism led to death of millions across Algeria, Vietnam and rest of the world.",2019-05-27 05:20:38

epupjmo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/bujpcp/,1,"""Saving accounts"" are a joke. If the inflation rate of the Tunisian Dinar is higher than that which the bank is promising (it almost always is, even with the USD and EUR, worldwide), you are giving money to the bank which will, no doubt, double or tripple your money every week and give you the amount you gave them back (if you're lucky) adjusted for inflation.

If you gave me 10,000 TND and I gave you back 10,500 but when you gave me your dinars it was 3.45 to the euro and now it's 6.90, you've lost half of your money

Convert the TND into a stable currency (Euro, Swiss Franc) and keep it under a pillow if you absolutely cannot invest it in something that appreciates quickly - like real estate **outside of Tunisia**

If you have a salary that is good enough to qualify for a mortgage in a developed/prosperous nation, the couple of grand could be used as a deposit on a rental property.

I will shill for Spain as that is where I have a couple of apartments, but you can take 9k€ and use it as a deposit, (30% of 30k€+closing fees) and then get a house worth 30 grand *today* that will, by the time the 7-15 year loan pays off, cost closer to 60. You'll be sitting on 450€ a month (minus ten percent for management agency fees, let's say 400 euros - 1200 TND) which, at the time of the house becoming outright yours will rocket to 1000 euros a month - 3500 dinars a month at today's rates or closer to 6000 when shit hits the fan.

6000 TND a month, if you can wait 5 years, is better with a 27,000 TND investment than keeping your money in dinars at the moment - you might as well keep your kids warm like Pablo Escobar did - it'll be more useful/valuable than keeping it in these unconvertable Mongolian shekels hhhh",2019-06-02 22:12:06

Indeed that is the same assessment many of my friends have as well given me and I probably think too that the odds of something happening virtually zero since I am not even certain that my former step father ever did something against me, let alone if it is even possible given my long absence from Egypt. Not to mention that generally Egypt would have to make an effort and I have never received or heard anything over the last four years from the neither the Egyptian Embassy nor my own home foreign office.

&amp;#x200B;

Nonetheless, I am not going to lie, I am quite a bit scared anyhow despite these rationalisations, because only the faint thought of me being thrown into a prison for something with which I had nothing to do anyhow is weird and makes me want into my bosses office tomorrow and tell him I am not going on the trip.

Imagine if all of the Libyan-registered cars perpetually operating on Tunisian roads had a road tax which is what it would cost for the car to be imported into Tunisia, where, over 5 years, a percentage of the duwana would be paid to the point where full-time Libyans in Tunisia would find it cheaper to just buy the same car (or a new car) and pay Tunisian import fees.

Not to sound too POTUS, but Tunisia could *build the wall* between Tunisia and Libya and make Libya(ns) pay for it. If they want safety and access to embassies, and they cannot provide diplomatic representatives the safety they need to operate, they'll have to pay.

A lot of the trashy Libyan teens escaping Libya would get weeded out this way and ISIS and co would loose a lot of their funds just trying to bring their troops onto Tunisian soil.

eqjus0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/byo2w9/,1,"If your end goal is to get out of Tunisia, are you going about things the wrong way:

For you to get hired in by a company in Europe, that European company must first look for employees among its own population for a period of time which is usually eight weeks and then if they cannot find someone from their own country they have to look for another eight weeks for someone from another EU country. Finally, they can hire you.

A Tunisian nuclear scientist which has skills obtained in Tunisia that could benefit Europe wouldn't have problems with getting hired. Someone who has a sub-par Associates degree (BTS diploma, lol) isn't an ideal candidate.

Begin by looking for scholarships and ways of studying abroad. Any money that you borrow now in dinars will be worth less in a few years due to inflation - you'll pay back half of what you borrowed if you pay out of your Euro denominated salary.

Many countries offer complete or almost complete scholarships. A degree from them would look a lot better than one from Tunisia. Canada, I hear, does not accept foreign degrees so you might as well do your education there and get a Canadian passport. Studying in Tunisia would be a dumb move at the moment.

If you want to travel from city to city you can take the bus or the louage, train isn't a very good idea.

er2ltyh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/byo2w9/,1,"Electrical Engineering Student at ENIT here.

In order to get to ENIT, ENISO etc you have to sit for the national exam after two years of prepa. 

For Prepa you can either go to IPEST which is supposedly the best one since they can sit for French National Engineering exams (such as X, CCP, E3A, etc). IPEST is restricted for those who have an average over 17 I believe, which is dawret al moutafayyi9in in the ""orientation"".

Now, the other prep Schools. You have IPEIT (Montfleury), IPEIEM (El Manar), IPEIM (Monastir), IPEIS (Sfax), IPEIN(Nabeul), etc..

Having scored a not so great average at my bac (14 and some change), I picked IPEIEM. 

First year went like a breeze, because I was a Pilote Student from Lycée Pilote de L'Ariana, the second year however was a bit grueling .

My advice to you is to not believe the hype, many people will tell you to avoid prepa and to go to Germany if you didn't manage to get to INSAT. Since a lot of people are avoiding prepa, there are a lot less competition these days.

Think of it like two extra years of High School. Once you're done with the national exam, your rank determines which Engineering School you can join. (Like some form of BAC 2.0).

Prepa has four ""specialités"":

* MP: Maths Physiques
* PC: Physique Chimie
* PT: Physique Technique
* BG: Biologie Géologie

&amp;#x200B;

You can also pick INSAT, if you're more into electronics and Computer Science (If you're MPI), and chemistry/Biology if you're CBA.

I have friends at INSAT, the system is different because they have a ""concours integré sur dossier"". Basically, by the end of your second year, your overall grades determine which speciality you could do (Génie Logiciel, IIA, etc for MPI).

The amount of stress may be slightly less than for those who decided to do prepa, but eventually in the end everything is worth it if you're convinced.

If you're thinking of going abroad, most engineering schools offer some form of ""double diplôme"" if you get the best results in your promotion.

Keep in mind that your performance at school, at prepa and at the engineering school will be different and you have to adapt quickly to it.

Good luck !",2019-06-13 17:12:34

It may have been. Once. Now it's a shell of what it used to be. The administration and staff and the terrible conditions will deter even the most diligent student. That's not to say that students there don't get into top notch French Engineering schools, eventually. They do, only thanks to their monumental ""personal"" hard work and their tenacity. The courses provided by the institute are sub par at best. Preparation for Oral tests (which comprise 70% of your final grade in the concours) is downright horrendous. There's a serious shortage of materials required for lab work, so no preparation for lab exams and your personal project (tipe) will be conducted there and you'll have to look for external sources to get by. The accommodation, though better than many dorms in Tunisia is bad. Moreover, the administration is tightening their budget every year and trying to get out of financing its students' studies. 4 years ago they used to take care of your application process and pay off for your expenses during Orals week, regardless of which concours you got your admissions in. Nowadays they raised the bar so high, it's simply laughable, considering they don't do jack shit to help you ""get"" into those top schools. They don't provide psychological help or assistance. They don't help you get over your academic hurdles (even though the prepa system is an extension of highschool where Professors must provide personal care for their students, at least that's how it's supposed to be in France) save for a few nice Professors. Keep in mind that sitting for the French concours as an Ipest student means you're gonna be under double the pressure.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry I just had to vent. Many people say that IPEST is the ""best prepa in Tunisia"" when the amount of shit that the staff put us through during these 2/3 years is just un-fucking-fathomable.",2019-06-18 12:40:38

erzsmkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/c2vbpk/,1,"Very interesting, but I doubt the correctness of some words (their Amazigh Origin)

Example: Bahloul it's defiantly not an Amazigh word.

Bahloul Wahab ibn Amr was a companion and judge of Imam Musa al-Kadhim. He lived in the time of the Caliph Harounn al-Rashid. To get rid of the Abbasid Caliphs who follow him because of he became Shia, he made himself crazy and act like the behavior of the madmen, and showed the rave and the stupidity, and so - through the foolishness and stupidity - he could pass his political views without harming him. So, he became famous for the crazy contrary to what it was.

So, the word (the name) Bahloul become the common meaning of ""dull"" in the Arabic language.

&amp;#x200B;

The more I read and the more I find errors and mistakes the more obviously is the lack of the deep Arabic language and the History of the writers

Another example:

&gt;changing the “z” to a “j”, is Arabic, especially as the Arabisation of Amazigh toponymy, names, and other words reversed back the “z” to “j”. For example, the town of Zerzis, as pronounced by its inhabitants, is arabised as “ جرجيس"" (Jarjis).

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe it’s true that part of the “Arabization” of some words is to change the “z” in to “j” (couldn’t find evidence though)

But in the mentioned example of the town of Zarzis, the opposite is the truth

Zarzis, original name before the Arabs was Gergis, which is a common “Biblical” Christian and Jewish name especially in Egypt and the whole middle East, which is even derived from the name George or Greek Georgios.

And as it's also common that in Latin, the Arabic Letter ""j"" ""ج"" is translated in to ""g"" and vise versa, the town gergis became  Jerjis ""جرجيس""... and with the time or maybe here the Amazigh pronunciation it became to Zarzis ""zerzis""

&amp;#x200B;

But fact, even if many Amazigh lived and still live in Zarzis and especially Djerba, both towns were roman province of Tripolitania, and even before the roman they were part of Jektis  Phoenician Punic empire. It has been said that Gergis and Girba were brothers, though there is no reliable evidence, but fact is Gergis and Girba was the name of the founder of the two cities.",2019-06-25 07:55:19

et77z2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/c3z17z/,1,"&gt; The EU is a protection racket to protect white interests

The European Union is a Union for...

Africans.

Nah, jk.

Malta is white and Christian, although being closer to Northern Africa than Europe. Cyprus is in Asia but inhabited by Greeks, also Christians and more-or-less white, hhh. Morocco tried to join the big boys in 1987 but got turned down for being... well, not European, not white and not Christian.

Of course we'll want Europe to be prosperous - even if it's at the expense of non-Europe. Ever notice how your king had to threaten us with ""either you take in our tomatoes or you take in our terrorists"" or some shit like that? You should be greatful we didn't go full United States and give you freedom for such trade offers.

Europe isn't the end of the world. Trade with Russia, Iran, Syria, Qatar (who is looking for friends) and MERCOSUR (bet you didn't even know what that was).

The biggest problem with Morocco is the Moroccan population. You are too divided among yourselves (while Bourguiba tried to unite all the tribes in Tunisia under one ""Tunisian"" banner) and can't rebel for shit. Your king pardons peadophiles and you shout Laysar Sidna louder. If someone came to my land and touched a toddler, he wouldn't survive. Just look at what Russians do to gays who they **suspect** to be interested in minors. You never see such things happening in North Africa.

The moment your people grow a pair and decide to achieve an adequate form of government... The moment your people stop allowing themselves to be walked over, is the day Europe, the rest of the world and more importantly YOU, YOURSELVES will begin to approach you with fair offers and not lowballs like the skyhigh prices your taxi drivers give tourists but in reverse, and not blatant disrespect.

Also, an improvement for Moroccan industry means bigger pockets for whoever is monopolizing it. The only way for a Moroccan, among his own people, in his own country and not in Europe where no-one wants him there (including himself, from what I've heard from many diasporans) is to start his own business - to be self-dependent. This requires a certain minimal IQ. An education. The right mindset. IQ depends on genetics and circumstances/surroundings. If your surroundings are inadequate, you'll always be the cow and not the slaughterhouse.

Basically, Morocco is the way it is for a reason. There's no need to try and change it. Let the woke Moroccans become ""kings"" and let the poor drown in the shit. We have a Russian proverb/anecdote: two mice are placed in two open jars filled with milk. One mouse becomes lazy, goes to sleep and drowns in the milk. The other mouse paddles it's feet until the milk turns to cheese and climbs out of the jar to safety. If you are the former type of mouse, Morocco is for you. If the latter, then Morocco is especially for you, hhh. Happy people who have lived in Morocco will understand.",2019-07-07 19:10:51

Generally speaking I don't really like the Nokia smartphones because they still have a bunch of weird design choices and bad manufacturing. The buttons get mushy pretty fast and their designs aren't that ergonomic.   

I can't speak much about the cheaper Xiaomi phones, but from their data sheets they are a gift send from heaven for the third world. High quality phones for affordable prices.    
I can tell you about their flagships tho. They are usually a 1/3rd of the price of comparable phones of their competitors, while archiving they same build quality, luxury feel, and often even outclass their more expensive competitors performance wise.

It seems that Polytechnique only has ""ingénieur généraliste"" path (like France), no CS specialty. I apologize for the misinformation, I was under the impression that it, too, had a CS option.

So that leaves Sup-Com or ENSI as the other options for prépa path. Sup-Com is too selective, and both programs are just badly designed from what I heard, they don't even study c before c++, many lacking notions in the curriculum. But at least Sup-Com has CTI so it's diploma is recognized abroad in case you ever change your mind and decide to go abroad, even maybe for an internship or temporary work for experience.

Buuuuut prepa is very competitive. So you really need to work very very very *very* hard. It's waaaaay harder than bac. Are you truly determined to do that? I just personally don't see enough of a difference between INSAT and the others to justify the physical and psychological torture you'll be going through. But if you want to try your chance and you feel a calling for prepa, why not! But as you said you really liked CS, I imagine you're truly prepared to work. Just know that you might even need to sacrifice nights of sleep to study (because that's what's needed to be among the top ranks from what I hear), which is not healthy. In the case of INSAT you'll get rid of prepa's headache and psychological warefare. Prepa's profs can sometimes be sadistic and enjoy ripping you apart and destroying your psyche, so if you know you can handle that sort of torture and you have a strong heart, go for a it, otherwise save yourself the crippling depression that you'll end up in.

But be ""à jour"" in both cases. Do as much old ""concours""/exams and exercices as you can. I wish you luck with whatever you choose!

4. Tunisia is neither secular nor liberal however it is making great progress towards that. Let me tell you this. If two gays kissed in the top 10 towns of Tunisia in public, how many of them would be attacked/beaten? See not so liberal and secular now. 
5. I am extremely open minded and liberal, so don't presume. 
6. Loads of North Africans don't get ""white"" as their mentality is purely skin colour based and we have all skin coloured. White is the binary used by Europeans in their colonialism and I continue to use the designation to discuss the binary and social structures that they created. It has nothing to do with skin colour, however the one thing that does have to do with skin colour is that loads of darker North Africans dream about going with a white woman. 
7. I am fully aware of the ancestry of North African populations. 

I am waiting for you to provide a compelling argument to promote mixing with Europeans rather than someone from a comparable culture. Instead you just provided personal attacks.

In order to maintain the value of the local currency, central banks must imperatively keep foreign-exchange reserves (you can dig more into this matter.)  

When allowing paypal, the gouvernment will lose track of transactions, causing the amount in the reserve to drop (people will spend more than they would earn.) Which will drastically affect the economy (we want to have more income than loss. ) the country will stop importing and prices of local products will raise (cf law of supply/demand.)",2019-07-25 22:28:59

Rue d’Athènes  and Rue d’Aljazira (both are right in the center of the city and are not very distant. But I believe there is a larger variety of products in Rue d’Athènes by souilah and also kallal shops for example. Yet there are many others whom I forgot the names

There is also a gallery where you may find what you need. It’s called gallérie sept (for seven) it’s specialized in electronic components etc... but mainly for mobiles, PCs and games consoles.... It’s in the neighborhood of rue d’Athènes.

Generally speaking it’s worth to remember that when asking for a component, in addition to its specifications, check if it has more than one french name and give if necessary a short explanation of its use and don’t forget to have a picture of it.",2019-07-26 01:05:13

&gt;I think you're overestimating things here. A few idiotically extremist people do not represent a society (...) the shared heritage is always mentioned at the official level.

With all due respect I think the false assumptions about Carthage and its racial causes and constitution are more normalized than your comment assures. The extremists (as you call them) are nothing but a continuation of the population mean and there is a low standard deviation on this issue according to my senses. The only way to verify this empirically would be to investigate the issue statistically and I am sure we both don't feel that is worth it.

Nevertheless, the idea, even if espoused by one single person, because it does not totally lack prospects on the impoverished field of our region's conception of history and identity, deserves to be criticized. This wrong idea, wrong as it is, is in harmony with the ruling Mashreqcentric dispensation of our region and so therefore is coherent with all the misconceived ideas which densely populate Mashreqcentric thinking. [Even on Reddit I have clashed with Mashreqcentric North Africans who are dedicated to subjugating us to an East-based metaphysical empire.](https://www.reddit.com/r/algeria/comments/bqoeti/dont_force_your_ethnicity_to_other_people/eo84scc?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

Shared heritage? Besides what comes down to us from the course of Arab-Islamic civilization I struggle to see the shared points. For my part, my position is that the two shores in antiquity were much more distant than people would like to assume.

&gt;Back to your question, yes, Tunisians are very aware of their history and proud of it, here for instance a plan to built a colossus of Hannibal in Carthage by Tunisia [https://www.espacemanager.com/hannibal-va-enfin-retrouver-sa-terre-de-naissance.html](https://www.espacemanager.com/hannibal-va-enfin-retrouver-sa-terre-de-naissance.html)

Excellent! I am thrilled that Tunisia is compartmentalizing its history without any complexes. I cannot wait to see the ""Tunisian facial features"" of this statue!

evdnkat,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/cjgbb6/,1,"&gt; What a fucking retard, speaking a language makes you belong to its speakers? 

It isn't as simple as that, you see, identity is a complicated matter, it can be defined in a ton of ways : language - genetics - religion - common history ... or a combination of one or more thing. Arab identity have been focused around the deep relationship between the Arab language and its native speakers. Speaking a language in this case does define an indivdual's identity.

As Maxime Rodinson said "" Those who belong to the Arab ethnic group, the Arab people or the Arab nation, speak a form of Arabic and consider it their ""natural"" language; regard the history and cultural characteristics of the Arabs as their inheritance; assert an Arab identity or consciousness. ""

&gt; and now you're saying we are Amazigh but that's also Arab while that makes no fucking sense because we're not even the same people nor we have the same blood 

""Blood"" isn't what defines an indvidual, we have diverse origins anyway and we aren't nazis, we aren't going to include and execlude people from an identity because of their ""blood"". Identity is flexiable, it evolves and changes over time over generations, our ancestors might have been berbers (mostly) 2000 years ago, but they might have been another ethnic group 5000 years ago (which if you study the development of Berber identity in pre-historic times, you would know is indeed the case). It simply doesn't matter, we are what we are, not what our ancestors were.

&gt; I can literally show you a real Arab saying that we are not like them and he recognizes us as Amazigh indeed 

People say retarded stuff, so what ? I can show you a real Arab saying that we are like them and recognizes us as indeed Arab, it doesn't matter what other people think, we are the ones having a discussion here, not them.

&gt; you should feel ashamed for being a hypocrite 

Respect yourself (as we say in Tunisian)

Yes, you can be literate but still be close minded. But being illiterate would ensure your close mindnesss. So I don't really see your point.

&gt; And as for your favorite open-minded country 

When did I call Lebanon my favorite open-minded country ?

Damn dude, can you just argue a point straight ? I was talking with the other guy about the mentality of the people, people in Lebanon are open minded in that regard (do I seriously have to explain this point ?) but they are also sectarian due to historic problems and conflicts, you can be open minded in your daily interactions but still be extremly nationalistic, racist or sectarian.

Also stop with your ""whataboutism"", it is just one town in Lebanon, I can cherrypick articles to make Morroco look like the worst place for non-muslims, I just don't do so, most of those articles are generally for a negative purpose, not to mention bad news are easier to circulate than good positive ones.",2019-07-31 10:43:50

excy06o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/cs652n/,1,"**Tunisian Arabic**

Tunisian Arabic, or simply Tunisian, is a set of dialects of Maghrebi Arabic spoken in Tunisia. It is known among its over 11 million speakers as: تونسي‎, romanized: Tounsi [ˈtuːnsi] (listen), ""Tunisian"" or Derja ""everyday language"" to distinguish it from Modern Standard Arabic, the official language of Tunisia.

As part of a dialect continuum, Tunisian merges into Algerian Arabic and Libyan Arabic at the borders of the country. Tunisian Arabic's morphology, syntax, pronunciation, and vocabulary are considerably different from Modern Standard Arabic or Classical Arabic.

 The whole deal with dialects is that they change over time and they're always are bound to change no matter what you make official. One of the best features of arabic is that it has stayed the same all these centuries (Even though you'd have a big deal reading ancient poetry, but it's a matter of vocabulary not grammar or morphology unlike for example middle english and Shakespeare). I think Arabic's presence as a unifying langauge is important. And I see it as an advantage over most languages of the world that we have so much diversity and differences but we call all understand each other through MSA instead of one dialect prevailing and supressing other dialects which are a part of each region's culture.",2019-08-19 07:51:25

Edit: persian, pashto, maltese are all languages NOT dialects. And like I said. A point that you completely ignored and went on a rant about defeatism and stockholm syndrome is the fact that Derja is highly irregular and we won't be able to extract grammatical rules.

' unlike my Algerian grandmother, who always hated Algeria) '

&amp;#x200B;

 I don't understand why your grandmother hated Algeria from the moment the Jews chose to follow the Pieds Noirs to France because, both of them, they didn't accept the idea of beig under the ""Arab"" rule (as they said not to say ""Algerian"").

 That is the only reason why they left, no one chased them away, on the contrary, especially since there were Jews in the FLN movement. If Jews have left leaving their possessions behind, they have only themselves to blame. 

The same is true for Morocco, where Jews left at night like thieves under the supervision of the Zionist movement, whereas there had been no conflict between Morocco and France over Morocco's independence. No one drove the Jews out of North Africa, they kicked themselves out.

 I remind you that under the Vichy government in Algiers at the time of the World War II, Muslim religious authorities had forbidden Algerians to buy Jewish property which was confiscated by the Pieds Noirs pétainists in power at the time.",2019-08-22 08:42:48

Notre bon roi Massinissa était l'allié de Rome pour avoir aidé les Romains à détruire Carthage et c'est la Numidie qui était nommée le grenier de Rome, vous n'étiez que des ennemis vaincus.  Notre Maurétanie césarienne de Juba II n'était pas mal non plus.

White people can be full of themselves. For your information homosexuallity was specifically legal in Tunisia and Algeria for up to 300 years. As in there was a specific law allowing it. it wasn't until White French colonists came (who murdered 50% of Algeria) that homosexuality became a crime. This is the same offense on the books today. Same with India, Malaysia, Singapore, whereever. It was you whites who changed the world's attitudes - and now you white people come with a holier-than-though attitude. What makes me more sick is that when France made homosexuality illegal in Tunisia and Algeria, it was legal to be homosexual in France at the same time.

Stereotypes are part of humanity. Being specific, also helps not lose our memory. Words are charged with history, cultures, heritage. I insist on being specific not because of hatred, but for Memory's sake and to prevent having our heritage lost to either big culture ( whether it's the east or the west! I don't discriminate)

Overall, i agree with you on the conclusion of this reply. We should focus on our languages, by giving a better place to amazing, and also by improving our derja in a written format for accessibility to every single citizen rather than focus on literary arabic that is only available to those educated. The educational system needs a reform, and French and English both should have a place in our administrations at least, to cater to foreigners but also to Tunisians that have bi-national parents as well as those having received a french education.

Problem with this, is that we can't force people to choose middle eastern media or arabic cartoons. That is even more true now that people are growing to use TV, less, and more internet based media. 

So a citizen that doesn't consume MSA type media will struggle (even if the slightest, shouldn't be neglected) and not be as comfortable. 

Otherwise, I agree for the rest. 

Also, knowing French helps with english based off of the fact that English has roots in both Latin and Anglo saxon languages.

f0tiypf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/d64nd2/,1,"&gt;C'mon you have to do better than this stupid argument ""ArE tHeY eQuAllY QuALifiED tO bE PreSIdEnt tOo ?"" a 5 year old knows the ansewr to that.

Maybe It's a stupid argument, but don't forget that you said this:

&gt;we dont care the people dont care as long as you dont belong to the old corrupt system.

I'm just trying to point out that we shouldn't consider not belonging to the old system enough for electing anyone. my question that a 5 year old knows the answer to, is just a counter argument to show the flaws of your statement.

&gt;And how is he a world class populist when he didnt even attack or criticize a single person from the system he didnt name anyone throughout his campaign he just criticized the system. A world class populist would start naming people and parties of the old system(Chahed Zbidi Nidaa Nahdha ..) which he didnt. 

I don't think that not criticizing your political opponents makes you a populist, I honestly would've loved to hear his criticism of the current system, especially of the current ruling parties, I think not clearly stating you plans, your vision, the policies that you're going to implement and how you're planning to implement them and at the same time claiming that your conscience forced to you to take the responsibility of leadership because you think you're the right man for the job, the voice of the people, the second coming of f\*ing Jesus, that in my opinion makes someone a populist.

&gt;You just one of these people who cant move on with their lives without dividing people into categories (left right populist progressive conservative liberal etc).

f0u2s6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/d64nd2/,1,"its a very simple situation mate: 

#Karoui:

He represent the old system, he's a sneaky cunt who will cooperate with as many as he can to reach the end goal, and the same things apply to ""the system"", parliment will be fine working with him (except for the usual ""no-no"" folks (jabha, abbou, marzouki, etc..)

* **the good**: stability, potential economical growth.

* **the bad**: more corruption.


------------

#Kais:

He represent the ""fresh vibe"" that all young people have been looking for, let's be honest with ourselves here, Kais didn't got elected because of his revolutionary visions or his super attractive charisma, he got elected because he simply doesn't belong to the ""political group"" that we all learned to hate so bad, it doesn't matter if he is a secular or a conservative,  it doesn't matter if he is an economical genius or ""conspiracy-theory fantasist"", what matter is that he **doesn't belong to the politicians**, which mean its gonna be extremely hard for him to cooperate with the parliment except maybe the Marzouki folks which we all know they are the ""0.1"" minority there. 


* **The good**: a necessary step to reach true reform (إصلاح), huge potential to completely eradicate corruption, true politician/economist will learn from this election and work harder in the next one.

* **The bad**: poor will get poorer, international relationship may get worst than the Marzouki era, expect the highest rate of strikes from unions (نقابات) in the entire history of the country, cause these are the main cancer of our corrupted system.

------------

So yeah, this is my objective opinion on the matter, i really **HATE** Karoui, even though he is from my city (Bizerte), which mean lots of good will happen in my region if he win, but fuck him, he's a cunt, 

but i also can't find a reason to support Robocop.

&amp;nbsp; 

So yeah, like i said in my very first comment here, the upcoming years wont affect the likes of me in any way or form, i'll just be happily watching the best democracy in the region, and i truly mean it, the upcoming years are going to be **very interesting**",2019-09-19 22:45:39

please don't feel offended but how old are you ? again, no offense, but it seems to me like you are very naive and think we live in a fairy-tail mate...

&amp;nbsp; 

The United states is one of the most corrupted countries in the world (if not the most corrupted one), South Korea corruption scandals are **countless** , Turkey has been corrupt since before Erdogan rules and it is now more corrupted than ever by him and his family/ally , The Italian government is still cooperating with the Mafia, and Qatar is hosting a world cup sponsored by slavery because the corrupted FIFA officials don't give a fuck as long as their bribes arrive in time. 

&amp;nbsp;

seriously man, forget the country and its future, its not like a single individual can have any serious effect, but for your own good, get that idea out of your mind, corruption has, is and will always be one of the main drive behind economical growth.


&amp;nbsp;

&gt; I wanna know how are you so sure about being unaffected ? i know you're rich but things can turn around you never know how bad it will get.


100% of my work is done online,  

i don't sell anything in Tunisia

I make ~20,000dt/month, 

I can travel and live anywhere i want when shit hits the fan,

&amp;nbsp;

And as far as i know, our geopolitical position will never lead to a war, so no matter how shitty things are gonna be, am almost sure that Bizerte will always stay as calm as ever, i wont be riding the panic train of the likes of ""Maya ksouri"" when they start yelling about how Kais is a salafist who will deny us our basic freedom, bitch we're tunisians xD the true terrorists couldn't change shit when they ruled and that was in the middle of the ""evolution hype"", so yeah am not worried about that either, bars will always be open, trabrib will always be available, and you can kiss and fuck whoever you want if you're smart about it, and i honestly don't give a fuck if some ugly gay from Tunis want to hold hand with his wannabe bouzidi boyfriend in plein sight :v  

I wouldn't mind it if i see it, but i will **definitely** not be electing a president just because he's gonna allow people to get ass-fucked, i have more issue to worry about.

&amp;nbsp;

And as young man, i advice to focus with stuff like: 

* ""faster bureaucracy"", it took me 3 weeks to open a company here **thanks to a lawyer**, in other countries you can do that in 48 hours, and by company i mean a tax ID (batinda) so you can work legally. 

* an immediate solution to international money transfer, 
back when i started working alone in 2012 this was the hardest issue for me, and it still is for every new person who want to get into any sort of e-commerce (app/wen/game development, design, dropshipping, affiliate marketing, etc..), am talking about what we call ""the paypal issue"", i personally don't have this issue anymore since i own a Euro bank account in both Tunisia and couple other countries, but fuck this is a 100% solvable issue, the previous government didn't focus with it because they simply didn't had enough pressure, and we did (#winouPaypal) they simply thought these ""kids"" don't have enough political power to ""sue"" them, well, here is the result ;) 


&amp;nbsp;

Sooo if you are one of Kais supporter, i truly hope you start asking him the right question, instead of getting that little Ecstasy rush when he talks about how ""powerful"" we are gonna look when we proof our sovereignty (سيادة) to France, when the reality is, France and her allies (N.A.T.O) can invade us, enslave us, and use our elders as a free protein source for animals and plants if they wanted to xD 

So please make yourself and the other Kais fans focus on more practical issues instead of these Ottomon empire fantasies.

&amp;nbsp;

We cant absorb shit we're already in a critical state poverty is spreading like wildfire as we speak. More corruption will never lead to any economical growth in this country.

I dont give a shit about freedoms too do whatever the fuck you want and i doubt anyone in power will take that away from us. 
I dont know why you think i'm a kais saied fan i just think that he will be better than Karoui i didnt vote for him and i dunno if i'm gonna vote in the second round.

I dont believe in this bullshit of ""we need to have stronger opinions in the region and talk shit to France"" i'm a realist and i know we are a very weak nation that cant affect any other country not even Lybia with a very fragile economy that has been fucked by corruption and bad decisions.

I am not sensationalising it. The whole of the British media are on top of this and I am merely the messenger.  I wondered whether it was being discussed on this sub and it seems to not be discussed so here we are.

Yes thousands of Tunisian jobs are at risk and what is the Tunisian government doing about it?  Like sending the police to stop a hotel from illegally detaining people against their will? And ruining their countries reputation?  

When tour operators go bust  some hotels sometimes tell guests they now have to pay for everything going forward.. and the guests have the choice whether to stay and pay or leave for a different hotel.   What never happened to my knowledge before is for hotels to demand payment from guests for the whole cost of their week/2 week stay retrospectively  and to lock the gates and stand guard with guns preventing people from leaving until they have paid.  That pretty much is unique to Tunisia.  What is also unique, is the apparent total lack of a response from the Tunisian police and government.     You are dressing this up as normal when it is not.   The reports also say that it was 2 hotels.  And there are no reports of the guests now being free to leave.


By the way, you are wrong, the guests will not necessarily be able to get money back from TC or ATOL or Visa.  Because  
a) TC is not bust yet and any payments prior to the bust will not be claimable.  Same with travel insurance, they will say ""it is between you and the hotel"" because it is not  a payment for ongoing accommodation after a crisis but rather it is payment for retrospective accommodation which was not your responsibility.    
b) Visa: Hotels usually ask for cash for this reason.  
Don't be so casual about thinking they will all get their money back.   
   
This would not happen in the UK,  the police would arrest the hotel owner for false imprisonment.   People take a risk when they visit a foreign country, it is up to that country's government to display a standard of behaviour they will want the world to see.",2019-09-22 13:07:42

You're also under an apparent misunderstanding of UK laws.

Most suspected shoplifters are consenting to stay with the security until police arrive. Consenting by the fact they are not objecting or trying to leave.  However, where a suspected shoplifter is attempting to leave the premises, the security can detain a person by arrest, if they have reasonable suspicion an offence has been committed by that person, and it is not reasonably practical to wait for a constable to make an arrest.  The detained person also  has recourse through the courts after the fact if they want to.",2019-09-22 13:30:04

I agree though that tourism isn't a good sector at all, most of the people working there would have seasonal jobs and be very mistreated by the hotels, and when the hotels are struggling they get a shit ton of loans etc (remember the huuuuuge bills they got forgiven? insane amounts) and when they're doing well they're still not paying people properly, dodging taxes etc

We have a pretty well educated population, we need to focus more on high value added products and services (making planes etc)

I can give you my opinion as a fellow cat owner in Tunisia and a friend of many others. It seems you want a ""high maintenance"" cat keeping experience. Most cat owners do not have such things. Scratching poles can be replaced with any old mat or carpet, cat beds are any random basket with a cushion or two if you want. Cats like to play with many simple or every day objects we use like balls or hair elastics. Never got a cat tree in my life, I think it's only necessary/useful if you have multiple cats (4+).

It's not surprising most pet stores do not have what you're asking for as there is not a big demand for them. Your best bet is big malls like Geant where I saw these occasionally before, Or if you're lucky enough to find someone here who bought them before and can informe you from where.",2019-09-29 00:53:07

""Populaire"" cars are cards in high demand. Demand is higher than supply sooo... You have to wait a while to be allowed to buy one. Peugeot for example takes 6 months. Some other car models take years. Usually around 3 or so years.  Sooo yeah. If you're not knowledgeable about cars take someone with you. There's a lot to check. Check the suspensions , check if it has decent wheels or not , the wheel covers add a good chunk to the price too depending if they are plastic or not. Check if the doors close right or not. Often times if the car gets into an accident , the door will close weirdly. Soo yeah pay attention to that. Any leakage is bad. The engine sound etc etc. If you're not knowledgeable about cars i advise you t ocall a friend who is. And you can certainly drop his price to a minimum of 19000.",2019-09-30 14:21:29

f2qf8hl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/ddoewi/,1,"**NASA spinoff technologies**

NASA spinoff technologies are commercial products and services which have been developed with the help of NASA, through research and development contracts, such as Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or STTR awards, licensing of NASA patents, use of NASA facilities, technical assistance from NASA personnel, or data from NASA research. Information on new NASA technology that may be useful to industry is available in periodical and website form in ""NASA Tech Briefs"", while successful examples of commercialization are reported annually in the NASA publication ""Spinoffs"". The Spinoff publication has documented more than 2,000 technologies over time.

In 1979, notable science fiction author Robert A. Heinlein helped bring awareness to the spinoffs when he was asked to appear before Congress after recovering from one of the earliest known vascular bypass operations to correct a blocked artery; in his testimony, reprinted in his 1980 book Expanded Universe, he claimed that four NASA spinoff technologies made the surgery possible, and it was a few from a long list of NASA spinoff technologies from space development.Since 1976, the NASA Technology Transfer Program has connected NASA resources to private industry, referring to the commercial products as spinoffs.

f2vtv3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/deaex0/,1,"&gt; Dude, we need to talk someday!

You can ask here if you have any questions, that way people in the future may find it useful too.

&gt; I'm currently a CS student, getting my bachelor's degree this year nchallah

you mean highscool right ? though bachelor literally translate to ""baccalauréat"" but in reality that's not what you think it means, [from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor%27s_degree#Tunisia) : 


&gt; In Tunisia, a bachelor's degree is referred to as al-ʾijāzah in Arabic, or la license in French; the degree takes three years to complete and is a part of the LMD (license, master, doctorat) reform, students can enroll in a bachelor's degree program in different fields of study after having obtained their baccalauréat (the national secondary education test). The degree is typically identical to the program of France's universities, as specified in the LMD reform. Most universities in Tunisia offer the 3-year bachelor's degree, except some fields, which are Medicine, Pharmacy, Engineering, Architecture and Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, solely offered by Tunis Business School and lasts 4 years.[7]

&amp;nbsp;



This is just an overall advice so that you don't mistakenly use it with a future client.


&amp;nbsp;


&gt;  I got a few freelance projects this year from HongKong (creating mobile app prototypes and some other stuff) through my Dribbble account. 

good for you! keep it up.


&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Receiving money wasn't that big of a deal, using my cousin's PayPal account (he lives abroad).

that's the spirit ;)


&gt; I'd like to have the money sent directly to me.

you can, just open a bank account (compte courant), or use [World Remit](https://www.worldremit.com/en) its an almost free version of Western Union, just slower (~3 days to a week), you can also use western union but its very expensive.

&gt; I can't use your trick, 

it's not a trick, its a legal law if you are exporting (my company only sell its service to foreigner so i am an exporter even that i don't have any ""physical"" product)

&gt; I'm still not making $1k/month constantly.

no it gotta be more than $1k/month, [read this](https://www.douane.gov.tn/ar/devises-et-change_ar/).


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Also if you're still young then don't worry about it for now, you can keep taking project and receive money through your local bank account without the need to pay any taxes as long as you're not making big money every month",2019-10-07 14:08:48

Python is great tool to learn but its freelancing market is over competitive and the fields it covers are very broad (ai, data analysis, automation, web services, plugins and add-ons, etc...)

the reason why i don't advice gamedev for the non-passionates is because it is fundamentally an artistic field, so you're gonna have lots of critics and whatnot and it is very hard to find the motivation once your lost in it.

That's from Wikipedia and therefore if that's what UN is about then it still useless, even their mediating conflicts is useless, where were when the first Intifada happened ? where were they when the second happened ? Gaza war ? Russian invasions of Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Chechnya, Afghanistan etc... ?

""and to avoid a major world conflict (and this is where the veto is important)"" Vietnam war, Korean war,  Yugoslav Wars, Indo Pakistani wars, Suez Crisis, Lebanese wars etc...

All of those wars happened in front of the UN and they couldn't do anything visible in all of them and this thing is on going, Syrian civil war is a major war with war crimes being committed every time and all what the UN is does is simply condemning and nothing more, they can't make Russia and the US leave Syria, their peacemaker soldiers can't keep peace (Lebanon and Egypt are a big evidence) and they can do is raping children (like they did in Africa) and so again, they are useless

""You're just very mistaken on the mission and the scope of the UN.""

It's not my fault if they keep saying bunch of lies like humans rights and peace, they can't make those happen, Saudi Arabia is killing its own people daily (or at least monthly) and they can't do anything about it

the UN have to be reformed, they need to make things clear like when to intervene in a country's affairs and when not to, i mean if the people are replacing their government no one should intervene but if the government is obviously committing crimes and no could stop them then they should intervene and also no one should be above the law, veto is a stupid idea that lets big bullies like the US or Russia or China bully smaller countries, if they commit a crime, they have to be punished, If Russia invades a land, they have to return it, pay lots of money to the victims and never do it again

I know that what i'm saying is obviously very difficult to make it happen but saying that the UN is doing a good job really annoys me, all those children dying and nations collapsing means a bad job",2019-10-12 07:37:44
f3ealmb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/df4r4d/,1,"**Intergovernmental organization**

An intergovernmental organization (IGO) or international organization is an organization composed primarily of sovereign states (referred to as member states), or of other intergovernmental organizations. IGOs are established by a treaty that acts as a charter creating the group. Treaties are formed when lawful representatives (governments) of several states go through a ratification process, providing the IGO with an international legal personality. Intergovernmental organizations are an important aspect of public international law.

Germany has a highly paid workforce that is very expensive, we're not germany lmao, I'm talking about stuff like this


Edit2 Here's the real bit of news, big sorry

&gt; In May 2015, Google announced its intention to create its own campus in Hyderabad, India. The new campus, reported to be the company's largest outside the United States, will accommodate 13,000 employees.[

Instead of India I want them to happen in Tunisia

&gt;-Amazon

Same stuff

&gt;Amazon said the new campus in India, spread over 9.5 acres, cost hundreds of millions of dollars and could house more than 15,000 employees. Amazon has 62,000 employees in India, roughly a third of whom are based in Hyderabad

Want those in Tunisia too


&gt;-Netflix Yes Baby that will be a huge win for our film industry . People will be watching ""wled moufida"" all over the world. They dont know yet that Disney, Marvel and others are shit compared to the brilliant ideas of semi fehri. I already see the Dollar$ flying in. 

Not everything is counted in dollars, it is extremely important for our culture to be projected on other countries, for one it'll make our tourism much stronger which is an important sector for us

And for the last paragraph, overall I agree BUT we don't have the know how to do all of that ourselves, which is why we need to learn from the leaders of the industry. Talking about resources, I think safi saied said he wanted to nationalise oil? The minute that happens the companies take their workforce away and we're left with an oil well that isn't working because we don't have the workforce to do that.

Positive changes don't happen overnight and for a country to develop and improve, to eradicate corruption and change people's mentality, it takes decades. We should stop acting like whiny spoiled impatient kids thinking there's a magic wand that can change things in a blink of an eye, and start working hard to achieve our goals instead. We have many tools available to us nowadays to reach out to the masses, to record corruption and report it, to express oneself freely, to vote and decide our own fate... All of which are something many other Arab and neighbouring countries can only dream of.

Also, the economy is not bad only in Tunisia, many economists speculate that there is a global recession coming. And our economy is still recovering and growing slowly.

With the conflicts everywhere in the world, terrorism, violation of human rights, natural catastrophies, climate change crisis (read about the water crisis of Chennai for example, a city of more than 10 million people who didn't have access to tap water for months), I count my blessings to be a Tunisian.

There was also a study I read in harvard business review that compared the number of patents between states that legalized same sex civil union and those that didn't, and they found that leaglizing same sex civil union directly improves innovation even when controlling for other variables

There is no law that says ""make economy good"", and I've just shown you how for example same sex civil union can directly improve economy, as the latter doesn't exist in a vacuum

Moreover, the state can not care about one thing at a time, there is nothing stopping decriminalizing same sex relationships. Do we stop the work of the ministry of health or ministry of women or ministry of environment etc etc just because we have a bad economy?

She’s an overachiever, she did it all, career wise, and put the cherry on the cake by marrying a very successful guy. She basically did it all, through discipline, you don’t get where she is by chance. The top of the mountain is a very lonely place, I feel like she started having existential thoughts, which led her to, what she does now, without any conspiracies or anything, let’s take her words for it, trying to help her hometown, Bizerte, and Tunisia in general. She doesn’t know this country, but she needs people to connect her, she fell into some very shady people (they might not be, but that’s the vibe I got from them), they were very uncoordinated with her, and they actually pulled her down. Her electoral lists included actors or famous figures, as an easy quick route to connect with people. It kinda gave her a vibe like she’s forcing herself on us. Her whole association/party debate, shot her in the foot, bad decision, a very bad one, don’t know if it was her decision or not. She tried to force values on the Tunisian people, that we are not ready to prioritize yet, like accountability, or to point out misbehaviors (in Tunisia they call confronting your coworkers on their laziness, snitching), she put on the table a whole set of values that the Tunisian government workers despise. 
So, if she stops shooting herself in the foot, and actually be a good judge of character to know who you should hire, and to actually call out the Tunisian people on their immoralities instead of just pandering to them, we can then decide if those ignorant insecure men are the problem, til then, please stop imagining sexism, you make real cases of sexism harder to spot this way, like the boy who cried wolf ...",2019-10-13 22:48:52

I did wish for decriminalisation of homosexuality in the next few years, but it is something we're so far from. Most people still don't understand what homosexuality is and think it is a disease or worse, a choice. Even if a law project did get issued to decriminalise it, it won't get past the parliament simply because its members (same as the masses) have many misconceptions and prejudices about the issues.

Dehumanization or an act thereof can describe as the denial of full humanness to others, and the cruelty and suffering that accompany it. A practical definition refers to it as the viewing and treatment of other persons as if they lack mental capacities that we enjoy as human beings. Here, every act or thought that treats a person as less than human is an act of dehumanization.

The ironic problem of course being that they want their own definition of gender which runs contrary to how society defines it, imposed upon the rest of society. Similar to how Berberists want to impose their own definition of who an Arab is, upon the rest of North African and Arab society, which has a different understanding of the word. 

&gt;but Turks are speaking their own language

According to your logic, Turkish isn't their own language because it is delusional of them to view themselves as Turks when most of their DNA isn't in fact Turkic.

&gt;their culture is similar to the rest of the turkic countries

Yes, but it is also different from the rest of the Turkic countries in certain regards and in other regards similar to the culture of the people who lived there before them, namely the Greeks.

Like North African Arabs.

&gt;compared to Tunisia whose culture is most similar with countries who share the same indigenous people weirdly enough.

I'm not sure if you're trying to attribute North African culture being similar solely due to Amazigh culture, but if you are, you're wrong. As for North African Arabs, our culture is mostly Arab, with strong Amazigh influences (obviously also recognizing religion and language as cultural factors). Of course Tunisia shares more cultural simularites with other neighbouring Arab countries with Amazigh heritage, such as Libya, than it does with Iraq for example, which is an Arab country with Mesopotamian heritage as well as Persian influences. We also share strong relations with Amazighis, but that is due to a strong mutual cultural exchange, not a one-sided exchange as I've seen many Berberists suggest.

To sum it up: Tunisians, like most Arabs, don't have a majority of Arab genes, but are mostly Arab in our language, culture and identity. And as most Arabs understand it, that is an Arab. You're free to have your own defintion, but when you, like transgenders, try to force that definition on people who disagree, it's hard to be sympathetic with you.",2019-10-16 16:55:19

You’re being disingenuous here. Obviously you weren’t talking about the Arab or Armenian minorities in Israel. Israel is a Jewish-majority country that’s well known to be associated with the Jewish people and lead by Jews. It’s not a coincidence that multiple people interpreted your post as referring to Jews. “The Jews secretly control everything” is also  a well known conspiracy theory among antisemites, so it’s not that difficult to see why your comment would come across this way.

&gt; PS, this is what I said 21 h ago just for context ""I am not talking about hating Jews (wrong on so many levels)”. 

Yes I saw you disclaimer, but saying “I’m not racist” doesn’t automatically make you not racist, right? Not that I’m calling racist necessarily, just pointing out the flaws in your argument.  

Also: 

&gt; “They don’t hate Israel as much as I do so they’re obviously Israeli secret agents”.

That’s pretty much what I got out of your original post. I wasn’t quoting you, and I don’t believe that you actually thought I was. 

If this wasn’t meant to be  your point then I’d love to hear what it actually was, but it really seems weird to me that seeing people not irrationally hating on Israel made you think “this must part of an elaborate plan the Israeli government”.

You just did it again, dude. You keep questioning whether the people you’re communicating with are real or not, that’s not a rational thought to constantly have. No one is hiring people to disagree with random Tunisians on reddit, that’s not how Hasbara works, you’re just being paranoid. 

&gt; Last point, there millions of Jews not in Israel, so yes, I can have zero affinity with Israel a State that is built on racial segregation, apartheid and land grab, and still have zero problems with Jews.

That’s not really how it works, though. Unfairly and irrationally hating Jews from Israel is still racist thinking, even if you don’t apply it universally to all Jews. In the same way that having a black friend doesn’t necessarily make you not racist, saying “I like some Jews” doesn’t necessarily make you not antisemitic (though once again, I’m not accusing you of *being* antisemitic, just using antisemitic language and thought process).",2019-10-16 18:50:44

The solution?

For the first issue, far more transparency =&gt; digitalizing as many process as we can, start implementing international norms like the ISO9001 (aka people need to be willing to write what they are doing), and finally, people should be more patriotic : Stop throwing trash on the road, prevent tax evasion from going rampant, avoid the black market as much as possible....

However, if I had to boil it down, I would say that the gap between rich and poor makes a large portion of society largely helpless and corruption makes doing almost anything a huge problem. When I send anything other than a post card to Tunisia, I have to send it FedEx to ensure nothing gets stolen in transit. Do I completely blame the guy at customs or at the post office stealing shit? No. Because he's getting paid almost literally nothing. I assume that he would be more honest with my mail if he could afford to, which brings us back around to the first point. 

The worst thing about corruption is that it cuts multiple ways. For example: During the last election I think I heard every presidential candidate be described as corrupt and terrible. Not only has actual corruption tainted people's view of these politicians, accusations of corruption have become a sort of bully stick that people use to beat up politicians with. Regardless of whether or not the charge is true, what honest person would want to pursue a career in politics with constituents accusing them of corruption whenever somebody comps him a meal? Especially when that person has an opportunity to study or live abroad. 

There are many problems that Tunisia faces as a country. However, if people could find a way to grow the middle class and to limit corruption within the social fabric, I think you would see a lot more prosperity and a lot more satisfaction among the general populace. Would addressing these two issues alone solve everything? No. Will corruption ever totally go away? No. But I believe that these two are the biggest issues.",2019-10-19 03:41:17

f4oo9ky,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/dl6m6h/,1,"It’s from a survey called the Arab Barometer ([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Barometer)). It’s used widely by political and social scientists and is seen as the best polling of the region. Beyond that, there’s also the fact that this a sub-sample which means the margin of error is higher. I’m not sure exactly how large the sub-sample was so we can’t calculate the margin of error that in particular, but I’d guess around +/- 7% or so. 

It makes sense though. There’s a whole sociological theory that one of the big things driving people away from religion in the US and Europe is that it become politicized. In much of Western Europe, religion was politicized in the 19th century and early 20th with the rise of socialism/social democracy as the opposition to conservatism. In America, this change didn’t happen until the 1980’s. The theory goes that a lot of people in the opposite party go, “If that’s what religion is—those crazy guys over there—then okay fine I’m not religious.” By politicizing religion, it pushes away those who aren’t fans of religion. You can read a popular write up by one of the Berkeley demographers who came up with this theory [here](http://bostonreview.net/made-america/claude-fischer-can-liberals-get-witness), talking mainly about America. 

As far as I know, no one has formally looked at this in the MENA context but it seems to hold true. I’ve followed the data for Turkey (a religiously based socially conservative party has been in power since 2002) and it’s shown the same thing—as a religious party comes to power, the opposition identifies less as religious. I’ve been eager for post-Arab Spring data on the Arab world because almost always, as political systems have opened up in the Arab world, the main conservative party has been a Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated or -inspired party, sometimes augmented with a Salafi Party (Nur in Egypt; I don’t think anything in Tunisia). While the hodgepodge of liberal and pro-old regime parties that have sprung often aren’t *anti-*religious, people who support those parties (especially young people with more fluid preferences) begin associating religion with “those guys over there” and stop identifying as religious, possibly even if there actual behavior doesn’t change. This will probably be one of the most important trends in Arab world over the 20th century.

One interesting thing, in places where we see sectarian conflict—Iraq, Yemen are both in the Arab Barometer—we don’t see this at all. If you’re a mostly secular Sunni, you’re still Sunni in Iraq’s politics whereas if you’re a mostly secular Sunni in Tunisia, you’re mostly secular. I think this adds strength to the theory.",2019-10-22 00:38:28

The Arab Barometer is a research project that produces scientifically reliable data on the  politically-relevant attitudes of citizens in the Middle East and North Africa. Since 2006, the project has conducted 29 surveys over three waves covering 14 countries in the region.The project is organized through a partnership between Princeton University, the University of Michigan, and the Arab Reform Initiative. Results are based on face-to-face interviews using multi-stage probability sampling to select respondents eighteen years of age or older.

f4qlbq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/dl50h3/,1,"Oil and gas are never a curse in themselves... This is a broken record argument that Friedman is pushing.

Canada and Australia depend on raw materials, and their economy suffers when prices go down. Norway has immense oil and gas reserves (more than 10% of its economy at one point is based on the energy sector- it exports more gas than Qatar although Qatar's energy sector is 60% of the economy) and it has one of the largest sovereign funds out there. 

It is how you use your ressources that matters the most.

Also, screw Thomas Friedman, one of the most biased op-ed writers in the NYT. Middle East countries can have strong military, a good education system and democratic institutions if they smarten up. And I wish that Tunisia's economy gets way better, then starts improving its military.

I can't finish the entire piece as it is behind a paywall, but knowing Friedman, any of his MENA analysis is shaped by his pro-Israel stance and his anti-Palestinian bias. This is the guy that pushed Bush's war agenda on Iraq and never apologized for it. He doesn't recognize Palestine's legitimate demande for their land. But most importantly he advocates for a strong Israeli military that dominates any country in the area ....no surprise that he advocates for weaker military for Israel's neighbors.",2019-10-22 14:34:21

So go figure ... 

Also, even developed economies have hard time regulating the cryptocurrency market, let alone collect capital gains taxes on transactions that are challenging to trace.

""It does make a massive difference because non-conservarism are different things to different people. 

For some, it is about the freedom to drink alcohol and skip prayers, while they may still be largely conservative when it comes to other societal norms (regarding marriage, gender roles, family values, etc).

 Some would identify as ""culturally Muslim"", and may even conform to a lot of semi-religious social norms to please their families and wider community. 

For others, it's less about the alcohol (Though I've been a non-believer for 11 years, I'm a non-drinker myself) and ""skipping all five prayers"" are only the bare minimum. 

It's about radically alternative lifestyles, which could go against everything our shares cultures stand for. Staring from gender norms, relationships, etc. 

To those who fall in the latter category, life in the MENA region can be freakishly unbearable. What's ""the wrong / trivial issue"" to you

Syrians piecfully revolted against Bashar right after the Tunisian revolution. Then Bashar started killing protesters through his military and militias . So Syrians started getting organized to defend themselves... Tunisians identified themselves with the plight of the Syrians and traveled to help, and the Tunisian government didn't really care in the beginning. 


By the time the Syrian conflict got confusing and complex and with the rise of Islamic State and its exactions, the Tunisian government (and others) started forbidding such movement to Syria.

I am sure that he is aware that he cannot appoint full time replacement right now. Although I wouldn't doubt he could consult with Ennahdha (and maybe others) and put permanent ministers faster than when Ennahdha would form its government (not sure how that would work...incumbent parliament could vote on it?).

And yes I agree. It is the PM that wanted them gone. It is more and more clear that under BCE, the PM had his hands kinda tied. In KS, he sees concordance of views in getting rid of those 2. 

Assuming Zbidi isn't lying (he is squirrely), he went from being received by KS and assured of the continuation of his work to getting fired in 1h. 2 days earlier Jhinaoui wasn't requested for a meeting with Germany's FM and asked not to attend the Francophone summit ...etc. so Yes, I see the PM's hands in the dismissals...But also KS's hands too.

Anyway ... I really do not see this as a big deal. there is a new president in town! that's it.

Last point...judging by KS's new team and especially having General ElHamdi (ex Army Chief of Staff appointed by Marzouki and originally from Kasserine I think) as his National Security adviser, this is a bigger deal and a clear sign of departure from BCE's team ...",2019-10-30 19:34:20

Justice must be achieved.I don't think that he is in person represent our Islamic party despite being its leader and don't think that as an act of betrayal or something.

Normally , I am not bothered by anti-nahdha people (true anti-nahdha people), and I really respect their point of view. It's true that Ennnahdha needs to be changed, and it isn't the perfect political solution in Tunisia. I don't know if Ettayar (democratic Current) is better than Ennahdha (despite they are leftists), but what I know from the beginning is that Ennahdha decisions are quite reasonable they are empty of populism.Third , Ennahdha party is the only party who's stable comparing other parties.

This obvious point must be emphasized because of a large literature, which recognizes non governmental activities as self-interested but arbitrarily treats any governmental activity as axiomatic proof of an objective social need for such activity. Despite the existence of some self-sacrificing public officials, to postulate that such officials generally controlled governmental decision making, seems less realistic than the opposite view that parties formulate policy in order to win elections rather than win elections in order to formulate policy.

That was due to the lack of integration between French speakers and English, in Quebec they have created draconian laws to favor the french language, with all the support from Ottawa and entrench themselves in the Canadian government, by having laws that have the supreme court be one third from Quebec and making it only possible to achieve a high political career by being bilingual, (with Quebec having the largest population of Bilinguals). I have nothing against francophones and I even wished it was mandatory to learn both French and English in Canadian School, and that French became a more integral part of life in Canada but as it is currently, there was no single instance where I had to speak french and there is no need to speak english inside of Quebec.",2019-11-02 16:33:42

Executive Order 13769, titled Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States, also known as the Muslim ban or travel ban, was an executive order by United States president Donald Trump. Except for the extent to which it was blocked by various courts, it was in effect from January 27, 2017, until March 16, 2017, when it was superseded by Executive Order 13780. Executive Order 13769 lowered the number of refugees to be admitted into the United States in 2017 to 50,000, suspended the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) for 120 days, suspended the entry of Syrian refugees indefinitely, directed some cabinet secretaries to suspend entry of those whose countries do not meet adjudication standards under U.S. immigration law for 90 days, and included exceptions on a case-by-case basis. Homeland Security lists these countries as Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.

For me it’s the best thing to use if the goal is losing weight, but I would never go keto (which is cutting carbs completely) because unlike what everyone wants to convince with, it is unhealthy, cutting any macro nutrient is unhealthy. I replaced all refined carbs with whole carbs, which is fruits, leafy greens, starchy veggies (potatoes, sweet potatoes), beans, lentils, peas, whole grains like brown rice and oats, bread made from 100% whole wheat without anything added beside water. Now, in determining how much carbs I need, I just count my macros, and see how much I need, I only count carbs, I go bananas on protein and fat, because you know, mild poverty doesn’t let you reach your goals in protein and fats unfortunately. When I was morbidly obese, the only source of carbs I had was baked potatoes, 87 calories for a 100 gram, 20 grams of carbs, it’s perfect. It’s the reason why when someone on this sub asked if we were boycotting potatoes, I said unfortunately I can’t, I can’t find any other source unrefined carbs, so low in calories, and it’s cheap compared to everything else, I know it’s considered high but compare it to sweet potatoes or quinoa, it’s nothing, it’s your best friend.",2019-11-11 17:20:24

I don't eat anything that comes in a package (which means processed and God knows what crop they put in it.)

Sweet potatoes are good.

The most important thing is ""you have to deserve your carbs"" Dont eat carbs and then sit on the couch and watch tv. If you eat carbs that means you're going to the gym to work your ass off. Try to make changes slowly and see how you feel and then adjust accordingly. It's like a new way to eat and live but it's worth it for me.

Few love him, but mostly because they perceive him as an anti-political islam. They would argue that he helped established strong institutions and a good educational system. I would think that the staunchest Bourguiba supporters would acknowledge that he erred on the democratic side and that he stayed for too long in power.

Some hate him and view him as a despotic leader who killed his own citizens and did not tolerate dissent. They view him in terms what ""he should have done"", not as what ""he has done"". In that regard they perceive his 32 years rule as mostly a waisted opportunity to lift Tunisia to a better situation, instead he helped promote a 23 year of despotic rule by his predecessor, since Ben Ali is a direct product of Bourguiba.

Objective Tunisian will recognize the good and the bad in him. He is certainly an enlightened dictator who produced mixed results. Most objective Tunisians would give him a slight below average grade. 

I can tell you from a personal perspective where I had talks with few people about when Ben Ali had his coup in 1987. People were crying of happiness that finally Bourguiba got deposed.

That answers 2 of points we disagree on. 

1) that Turkey did not start contributing to the decline of our industry because they export products we also make (staring in the early 2000s). You can see the volume in 2005 for Turkey imports being insignificant.

&gt;After Israel's independence War in 1948, most Palestinian were chased to Gaza and Cisjordana,

To be precise, at the time they didn't call themselves ""Palestinians"" but just Arabs, or Palestinian Arabs, and it wasn't after the war, it was during the arab-israeli war that some fled or were expelled, while others were ordered to by the Arab countries during the war. The Arab exodus was encouraged by many Arab leaders, such as Haj Amin el Husseini, the exiled pro-Nazi Mufti of Jerusalem, and by the Arab Higher Committee for Palestine. They viewed the first wave of Arab setbacks as merely transitory. ""Let the Palestine Arabs flee into neighboring countries. It would serve to arouse the other Arab peoples to greater effort, and when the Arab invasion struck, the Palestinians could return to their homes and be compensated with the property of Jews driven into the sea.""

&gt;In the 6-days-war, Israel beat Egypt and Syria and took over Gaza and Cisjordania. It progressively became a security nightmare, especially after the rise of Yasser Arafat and the first large-scale Intifada in the 1990s. 

Yes, it happened progressively, when Israel pushed back the Egyptians and took over Gaza, they started building hospitals, facilities, farms, and many infrastructures there for the Palestinians to benefit from. Those infrastructures are still used today but not for the same purpose

f9d9jw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/e4ko7q/,1,"For starters, Tunisia is located in North Africa. We're the _relatively_ small country between Algeria and Libya. Often mistaken for being Arab, North African countries' cultures are actually unique because they are heavily influenced by the Berber/Amazigh culture. Unfortunately, a hundred years of invaders definitely made it hard for the Berber culture to survive, but it is basically a flower that is growing under layers of concrete
Anyway, I'm done with the intro, so I'll start with the food: 
We mostly eat spicy food in Tunisia like shakshuka, couscous (we have a dozen recipes of couscous), pasta. There is also a pepper paste called harissa that we basically smear on everything that is edible and savory.
Plenty of food pictures in this quora answer:
https://www.quora.com/What-do-people-eat-on-a-daily-basis-in-your-country/answer/Bouthe%C3%AFna-Ben-Sedrine-1?ch=10&amp;share=e01c90db&amp;srid=TiYH

Language: in Tunisia, we speak a dialect that is a mix of different languages like Berber, Arabic, French, Turkish, and even Italien. It's generally hard to understand even for people from the middle east. We can't even explain how grammar works because we basically pick up the dialect from our parents. I never knew this was weird until I met foreigners who kept asking me for rules like plural forms and past tense forms and I genuinely had no idea how I could help them. 
In school, we learn standard Arabic (which is pretty much as useful as Latin) at the age of 5, French at the age of 8, English at the age of 12 I guess, and then you pick an optional language at the age of 17. I chose German, and of course, that was a terrible mistake. 
If you're interested though, I can send you the link of a grammar book that peace crops elaborated in 1977. Reading that book was a huge surprise for me. Found somewhere in archive.org

I'm not really a sports fan so we have to wait for someone else to answer this part. 

As for religion, the majority of Tunisians are *Muslims*, then come the Jews followed by the Christians. Being Muslim is rarely a choice because people simply follow what they were taught and just go with the flow. So even though a lot of Tunisians are Muslims, they are rarely pious and have little to no problems drinking alcohol and doing what is presumably haram. 

Overall, Tunisia is a chill country. We're probably going through a rough patch due to the revolution but overall life is good!

Right, using Arabised to refer to regions is normal I don't find it in the slightest objectionable, however, I'm still uneasy with it when used to describe people. You can likewise find equivalent words used to denote regions whose demography has changed, just with other cultures. I have heard about the ""Turkification"" of Anatolia and the ""Anglification"" of the British Isles. However, I've never heard anyone refer to Turkey's population as ''Turkified Anatolians"" or Englishmen as ""Anglified Celts"". Although they, just like North-African Arabs, live in Turkified and Anglified areas, and aren't predominantly Turkish or Anglo-Saxon genetically. In addition to that, analyzing it linguistically, calling North-African Arabs ""Arabized Berbers"" is saying that they ultimately are Berbers, just that they've ""turned"" Arab in some sense, which is kind of weird. Those are the reasons why I suspect the term ""Arabized Berber"" isn't used much in academia. However, my objections to it go deeper that that. Not only  does it appear to me that describing a people as [ethnicity]-ised [some other ethnicity] is limited to Arabs, it also seems to be used predominantly for North Africans in particular (in Arabic at least). The Arabic wikipedia page for ""Mosta3rab"", only include ""Amazigh Mosta3raboun"" and ""Akrad Mosta3raboun"", which is weird considering how virtually all Arab areas outside of the Arabian peninsula are Mosta3raba by the words definition (including Yemen). I once read a comment of an Egyptian cursing Tunisians as ""Musta3rabiin"" lol. And yeah, the term is also used as a slur at times, especially by some radical Amazighis and racist Mashriqis, and that isn't excactly weird when you consider that the word lingusitically is tentamount to ""wanna-be Arab"". But yeah, enough of that rant, it might be that I'm just over-reading into it.

Democracy means your country gets a parliament at your own image.

There are still decent representatives inside Parliament who are trying to honestly do the job. They aren't criminals. They aren't crooks. They are respectful and responsible people. These representatives never make headlines but I'm glad they are there. If these people weren't there, Tunisia would have collapsed a long time ago.

Coexistence of Tunisians and their acceptance of diversity: use the example of the cemeteries in Le Kef, where three cemeteries of Jews, Christians and Muslims are literally few meters away from each other and Kef used to have a church, a synagogue and a mosque.

Delicious food: Mediterranean diet is one of the best out there, and our cousine is a beautiful mix of different cuisines with its unique Tunisian stamp.

Our dialect: it is also a beautiful mix of different languages: Amazigh, Arabic, with some French words, Italian ones, Spanish and Turkish too.. and it sounds nice to the ear.

Diversity of the landscape: Snow in winters (Ain Draham, Beni Mtir..), mountains and forests (North West), amazing deserts and oasis (the South), vast green valleys (Beja, Nabeul..), and beautiful beaches with a long coastline. Architecture: The Medina in Tunis for example is literally few meters away from the French-architecture buildings, mixed with few more modern buildings..",2019-12-10 13:03:28

""Our tunisian traditions are not 1400 years old get your head outta of your ass only scum deny their roots, change will happen it doesnt need us to force it on our kids. Humans love conflict, it existed since day 1 before any religion even when christianity was the dominant religion people divided and started conflicting within the religion, that's just human nature where there is humans there is conflict the goal should be to control these conflicts and keep them in check (avoid wars and destruction) not deny our history. I met a lot of atheists who love conflict and fighting as much as the others and hold the darkest hatred toward religion. Let's say 99% of the world is non religious do you believe conflict will stop ? cause i dont.""

You begin with insulting people as if you were the most rightous tunisian on earth (maybe you eat more mlou5iya idk and idc). Accuses of betraying roots whatever that means.

""change will happen it doesnt need us to force it on our kids""

The most stupid thing ever said. May be we should wait untill more people die.

""Humans love conflict""

Red herring.

""it existed since day 1 before any religion even when christianity was the dominant religion people divided and started conflicting within the religion,""

You begin with ""before any religion"" and proceed with when christianity was ""dominant"", no link between the begining and the end of your ""argument"". And christianity is irrelevent to Tunisia. Unless you're ignorant about islamic history and atrocities which are more relevent to us.

""that's just human nature where there is humans there is conflict the goal should be to control these conflicts and keep them in check""

Then begin by not using red herrings when ever we speak about an issue.

""I met a lot of atheists who love conflict and fighting as much as the others""

Again, not relevent. There is no atheist terrorist groups and communist groups are dogmatic, so they're more religious despite being atheists.

""and hold the darkest hatred toward religion""

Irrelevent, but looking at how you built up untill here you're trying to demonize atheists, because you're definitaly angry as we criticize your religion and you don't have any valid argument to respond. And abrahamic religions deserve hate anyway. You maybe hate communism, some of us hate religion. We have the right to. It's none of your business as we don't call for violence and war.

You are jumping around the issue : blame christians, blame atheists. Afraid to name the ideology?? Islam. Islamic terrorism. + half the country is backwarda because of what? Islam. Name it.

Ad hominem fallacy.

&gt; Islam isnt why we are backwards people who sells it are not gonna go into much detail but that's it. 

You want more details about why islam is backwards? I can give you a giant list with each signle problem being a huge barrier to progress :

- woman's rights. The only barrier at this point is islam

- LGBT issues. We stagnate again because of islam.

- terrorism. Islam.

- afterlife fetich and scoring points. Islam

- resisting teaching science properly. Theory of evolution is still denied because of islam.

- etc.

&gt;atheists think people are good until religion comes in

Strawman. Thanks for attacking a view nobody holds.

&gt;when it's the opposite people corrupt religion and use it to satisfy their need of conflict.

Really? This is such a naive thing to say. No wonder we still have terrorists jumping around. You think your interpretation is the only valid one in islam? You think that islamic terrorism isn't ""real islam""?

Idc about how you interpret and cherrypick your scripture as you want. Some people want to apply it litterally and blindly and force it on everyone. Cutting the hands of thiefs is in the quran. Wife beating, killing disbelievers, etc.

Love it or hate it, this remains an interpretation. And it will allways stay around and people will get killed because of it.

&gt;I'm just gonna say this not gonna go through your 10000 words paragraph about how everything you dont like is a red herring or a fallacy or irrelevent to the subject like you get to decide what's relevent and what's not.

1. Not only I showed where you made the fallacies. But I named them.

2. You accuse me of pointing to your fallacies because I ""don't like"" what you're saying, whatever that means. I don't like arrogant people especially when they're wrong.

There's a difference between foreign investment and neocolonialism, just like Khaleejis are dictating certain laws in Tunis, the Chinese will expect us to make ridiculous concessions in return for their money. 

&gt;That's bullshit on so many levels

You just contradicted yourself, you said it's less of a shock when it's Muslim countries... Yes..because people are INDIFFERENT to Muslim suffering. Indifferent means: no particular interest or sympathy, let me tell you, having lived in Europe pretty much all my life, people here ARE indifferent to Muslim suffering.

Also, Afghanistan was an EXAMPLE, don't be so literal, there are plenty of terrorist attacks in peaceful countries, that get swept under the rug because the victims happened to be Muslim. Look at NZ mosque attack for example, did you see how the tabloids described the terrorist, and I quote 'Angelic boy'. People stopped talking about it the next day, and I've barely heard anything since, but I still hear about Charlie Hebdo to this day. 

&gt;And no one is arab countries cares what happens in China for example, it's not the world against us that's a stupid idea in so many people's minds

First of all, you're not wrong, countries INCLUDING Algeria, have signed a letter in support of China's 'anti-terror' campaigns.

fbe5y6y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/ecth60/,1,"Sorry for the wall of text, you don’t have to read it if you don’t want to. I think you need a deeper study of the existing systems and a good analysis (étude de l’existant), we have websites now, why they’re not consulted by people? Why yours would be consulted? That kind of thing. 

1\ lack of communication between the politician and the people? I hugely disagree with that, politicians are handing out the people exactly what they want, look at our president turning to Alex jones feeding our boomers conspiracy theories, you telling me that ain’t what they want? Watch the useless dramas in parliament, and watch our highest watched shows, isn’t it the same content? They’re delivering them exactly what they want. 
The people doesn’t want public organisms to cut useless personal or any accountability, the people doesn’t want privatization, the people doesn’t the union’s reach the reduced, and the only guy who mentioned the unions, makhlouf, wants to replace it with another union, so the people elected exactly who they heard them, the people has no program and don’t know where’s the best road for them so they elected people who have no program, so maybe the problem is that politicians listen too much to the people instead of improvising? But improvising means diverging from the will of the people would get them not re-elected so ... so I don’t agree with your assessment that there is a lack of communication, people like Yassin Ayari tried explaining why he holds certain values, in an attempt to direct the people towards them, and explained how people are fighting those values for greedy reasons plain and simple, and where did that lead him? Nowhere. So I’m sorry but I don’t agree with your assessment. 
2\ this is the program of the organization called البوصلة its shotcaller is called chaima bouhlel, you can DM her on Facebook to ask her what steps she reached in doing it, but I remember she’s only doing it to parliament members, no ministers or president are concerned.
And concerning the app, what I’m curious how are you going to manage to leave your political opinion out of it, will it be graded good or bad according to who? I think the website we got now, that yassin ayari posts occasionally to show the people what deputy voted for and against what is perfect. You can open it, look for the clause you want, see who voted for or against it, make your deduction, and move on. But the real question, do we, as a people, have enough consciousness, patience, commitment, involvement, to do it? It doesn’t get easier than this. I personally only opened it once, and it was because yassin ayari shared it, I think he wanted to demonstrate how much noureddine bhiri is hypocritical at the time. Also you have to change the law to make the people vote, that’s kais saied’s only program if I remember correctly, and idk what progress he made in that, and idk if that’s our actual problem or is it our priority, do we want a people who wanted nahdha nabil and abir to vote directly on governmental decisions? Wouldn’t that just speed up our demise? It’s just my opinion, I applaud you, good luck.",2019-12-19 18:08:51

Furthermore they are making people addictive and lead to depression. Studies have shown that especially the young generation is suffering. Also they are not contributing to GDP while paying no taxes. 

So the goal should be a social platform with high privacy standards with a fair market place included. (A combination of Facebook and Amazon with tunisian goods)

Your primary concern, if I understood you correctly, is that we are too quick to forget about what makes our lovely nation so, indeed, lovely. In that process, we cast judgment gratuitasly without thinking of the consequences. This is true, but up to an extent. 

One of the things that I wish to avoid in particular is the us vs them mentality.

We're in an increasingly globalized world, and news travels fast. Hiding our dirty laundry, in my opinion, serves no purpose other than bolstering our national pride. Which while important in times such as these, times of great discontent and economic cynicysm, does not account for the global wave of discontent we see around us.

Hong Kong, Iran, Iraq, Latin America, ect... are all facing their own ordeals, but it is precisely because they air their dirty laundry online (some cannot even afford such luxury, like Iran) they are able to gather global support and quicker action from the global community.

What we need, in my opinion, is not further isolation from fear of the tarnation of our image. What we need to do is to meticulously look at ourselves from the countless mirrors of the outsiders and work on each problem on a case by case basis.

It's not the individual who is accountable for the failures of the state especially in our own case where the state owns the individual and the state is entitled to the individual's money and labor.

Now to address your first argument that 10% tops are uncivil and anti freedom with a counter argument. Things have been going on in a terrible way since the pre colonial era. We have almost the same issues as they had then. ( A corrupt ruling class, intellectual void, poverty, monopolies of entire sections of the economy by a few, no class mobility, forgotten and rotten regions....) And yet people are in a hobbsian state of mind where most of them agree that the Beys, France, Bourguiba, Ben Ali are better then nothing. And we should set low standards for our rulers for the sake of SAFETY not freedom and not wealth SAFETY.

I said its reductive to retain only that from his reign. Not to mention it's unreasonable to expect democracy from a country just out of colonialism.

Listen maybe you should hit the library and learn a thing or two about history and the state of Nations prior to the implementation of democracies.

No nation ever was in a state of flourishing prior to the implementation of democracy.

Your line of thinking is a part of the problems that we're stuck in. False and subjective nostalgia about the past with a clear dismissal of what we can accomplish if we go forward and do the things every thriving country did.

The reason is simple 

Our internet services and the hardware technologie are 80years behind the rest of the world and the gap is getting larger each day

Job market in the domaine is suffocated by eastern europeans Around the world and trust me they are very skilled and have access to top tech ( well years ahead of us ) and they are cheap and they are beating the hindis in europe and around the world.

Any medical technician is like 3 years studies and can get good life with few extra “formation” or courses and can easily get a job abroad or in tunisia since you speak more then just your mother language 


You can always learn a skill that u can offer for money and start your own business

Otherwise i can tell you aim high dont be afraid of  getting a bac+6 +  they are really worth it

When French is taught in school depends on what the government decides at the time. When it was still a French colony, of course it was taught starting in elementary school. But in the public schools now, it is generally not taught until about high school or so. Most old people (especially old women who are illiterate because they were not allowed to go to school) and uneducated people do not speak it. Among young people now, it is pretty common for them to speak more English than French or to at least prefer to speak English. Most of them protest if I try to speak with them in French.

Secondly give me one example of where a developed or successful  that country uses foreign language to teach math and science. Just one example. In other countries people learn French,
And English in order to speak that language not learn math or science in it. 

Thirdly this demonstrates what’s Malcom X called mental enslaved in which the enslaved or oppressed are told to accept the masters reasoning for their enslavedment. the way you guys are defending and justifying the use of foreign language for for teaching math and science is baffling to me to say the least.

Now that you have run out of reasons you’re changing the topic. BtwTunisia situation and context is no different than other countries that were colonized. I mean Vietnam was colonized by the French and around the same period in 1880s. Yet after they gained their independence they made decisions to replace French with Vietnamese and now Vietnam is doing great with literacy rate of 98%. 

2nd, your neighbors are actually worse as I heard in Morocco they have French mandatory in school. Whereas for Algeria French due to longer occupation and plus the French colonist which lead to having it bigger impact. Of all the countries in Maghreb theres no really as each country teaches French in college/university level. 

3rd why can’t the Tunisian goverment have the teaching manuals in Arabic or Derija as that would come easier to teachers and students due to fact that you guys speak that language unlike French which is not native to Tunisia. 

4th, changing to English isn’t hard what’s hard is changing from French to Arabic/Darija. 

Modern science is learned and taught in Arabic in many countries I don’t why u think Arabic is not capable of adapting to it. I mean in Jordan they teach everything in Arabic and yet their education system isn’t bad. Or even Syria country of my parents they had decent education before the war and everything was taught in Arabic from low level to all the way to university. If modern science is based around Latin how come non European countries like Israel, japan South Korea are doing great. I’m sure when those countries teaching they use their native nomenclatures. Overall I would say the one biggest problem the Maghreb countries like Tunisia are having is education System that’s based around multiple languages Arabic and French.

Tunisia is kissing American ass moreso than French lately (hence the purchase of American military equipment and the base in Benzert - yes, it exists) and as such, any ""terrorism"" in the way you are thinking seems highly unlikely. If you start improving your military (why would you? it isn't to... uh... stop taking orders from the US, is it? that'd make you enemy number 1, like Syria, Iran, Cuba, Russia, etc and would mean your military supplies get cut off...), questions pertaining to ""why"" will begin to be asked...

Tunisia(ns) do not want that (if they don't want their country to be cut off from the world or bombed to hell like Iraq, Syria, Libya, etc for standing up to American imperialism) so it's best to stay cucked by the US - which will soon become irrelevant guys, so hold strong lmfao

&gt; new threats from other countries etc

I think the only threat that Tunisia (really) faces is one of American, imperialistic nature. You're not getting raped (with ""terrorism"") only because you're giving your ass to them voluntarily imho. Soon, they won't be the police of the world anymore. Not just in MENA/shit holes... in general... Russia, China, India, etc are fucking them big time.

&gt; Hafter is letting terrorists enter Tunisia

He isn't *explicitly letting them enter Tunisia*. He is arresting suspects and letting them go on the condition that they do not interfere with his doings in Libya. Tunisia is next-door. It is the role of the Tunisian intelligence/counter-terrorism organisation(s) to intercept and prevent terrorists from entering the country. The Tunisian government would rather allow holes to exist in the border so that bedouins can smuggle stuff to survive at the expense of terrorism happening, instead of getting their shit together and creating jobs so that they no longer have to. Haft**a**r is merely getting rid of headaches for himself. He is not explicitly interested in hurting Tunisia, though his negligence is malevolent.

&gt; how different countries are doing suspicious things and so on

Countries always do suspicious things to each other. Nigerian diplomats use their immunities to bring rare, million dollar paintings and other stolen goods out of the UK through their embassy. The Russian embassy in Argentina was found with 400kg of cocaine. Ecuador was housing Wikileaks boi in their embassy in London. Want to become a hero and try and stand up to the string pullers? Be my guest. The Algerians succeeded in kicking the French out, maybe you'll take a bullet or two for us.

&gt; we have to show the world that no one messes with us, not anymore,

Y'all are letting infected Algerians go to your hospitals and kill 20 of your babies. Tunisian negligence has caused more deaths upon your own people than any foreign power has since the genocide of Benzert. You need to get your shit together. That, and the reason your army is at least *somewhat* adequate is becuase, **newsflash** you have American bases and other interests most people don't know about in your country. In exchange, a country with a similar human right's record to Algeria (a US adversary) - Tunisia, has American technology and support. The US helps anyone it sees fit, including Muslim-genociding Saudi Arabia.

Iran, having less harsh punishments and a better vibe than Saudi Arabia, is America's enemy - only because it has it's own interests and doesn't want to be cucked. You **cannot** be independent in the true sense. You've dug your own hole far too deep. Try to get out and the US will immediately sense resistance and will do everything to end you. You will become the Syria and Iraq you don't want your bled to be.

&gt; we might end up like Syria

A shit tonne of uneducated, retarded (in the literal sense) Sunni Muslims didn't like a non-Sunni leader who only cared about his own (Alawite) people. The US meshed a desire to see Assad gone with the carrot-dangling offer of an Islamic state, and so all of these Islamist alternatives to power showed up, all (interesting how coincidentally) more interested in removing Assad than providing a safe enviroment/rule of law for the people in the areas they control.

I don't (and I've been here for a while and have Tunisian family) think that Tunisians are retarded (I am being sarcastic, they aren't!) to want what the US and Co. is helping the opposition in Syria arrange. You guys wouldn't want an Islamist government and would fight tooth and nail to erradicate ISIS.

Algerians, Cubans, Russians, Venezuelans, Iranians and Chinese would also fly in at once through the back door and let their ""little green men"" (like in Ukraine, hehe, checkmate Yankees) fix your problems once and for all. Literally not a concern, **hhh**

&gt; with the current government, nothing good is gonna happen

Nothing good can happen without your DNA felixes twisting counterclockwise and your IQs jetting to 120+ overnight. You're shackled by the biggest empire on earth atm. Unlike Afghanistan and Iraq, you didn't have to have the chains forced onto your wrists. You put them on voluntarily.",2019-05-22 00:13:17

eofiyfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/bri4nh/,0,"I'll start with the response to the last paragraph.

The people on the subreddit on not a representation of the Tunisian population.

Many people here are virtue signaling and saying that Tunisia needs to have gay rights, and to foreigners and visitors they swear that rights are respected but if you look at the comments on the post praising the advance of a reversal of charges against the Shams LGBT Rights group, any comment in favour of normalisation of LGBT rights is heavily downvoted.

To improve one's image, Tunisians will swear that they are open minded but when you given anonymously ability to download and disagree in crowds they will do so in large numbers.

When I begin my day and I try to to leave the house, the first thing I do is get into a taxi. The taxi driver sees me and tries to bump up the price to 20 Dinars for a two and a half dinar Journey (even though he sees me on the same 3m² platform every single day).

When I get to the taxi jami3i station and make it to Tunis, freret on the street approach me ""Française? Deutsche? Russiche?"" (They haven't learned the denonym for a Russian in Russian, cracks me up lol)

The cost of mlewi doubles for me. Lots of shit I can't pull off the top of my head right now.

When returning from the airport to my house after a trip abroad, the taxi counter reads 12. He tells me that including my one piece of luggage and airport departure fee (I hailed the cab from the highway, not arrivals), I must pay him 25. Curses me out in Arabic thinking I don't understand.

The constant &gt;Tunisian&lt; (majority of the population, not educated, cultured, well-off few who use Reddit) always try to fuck me over. It's not funny. This is a fact of life here.

To avoid this fuckery (which doesn't work on me because I know what's up but the shit tier hoteliers serving cheap Russians get away with it), I want to earn more money to afford a house in a nicer place, afford a car and to associate myself with people who, like me, having grown up in the UK, won't engage in daylight robbery. You just don't see poor Europeans doing shit that some (in some cases middle class) Tunisians do.

Yes, I am married to a Tunisian. Yes, I absolutely adore her and her family and friends, but I don't want our kids to grow up here. My parents didn't want Ukraine for me. They still visit and love their country of childhood dearly, just at a distance.

Anyone who has a carte de sejour or has spent 183 days in a fiscal year owes taxes in/to Tunisia. Tunisia would take a platinum medal in Attini floos if it were an Olympic sport. If I can send you a picture somehow, I can sign into my online banking and show you my jurisdiction of tax residence.

Your Nabeul-Hammamet shopkeepers are selling contraband Algerian cigarettes. Your Coca Cola in the glass bottles in hotels is brought in from Egypt. Your Tunisian businessmen are robbing subsidised goods from neighbouring and distant, Arab and otherwise countries. Electricity is subsidised? Azbi.

Ah, just remembered, my electric box has a big black cable going to my apartment and two wires, a brown and a blue, into another apartment. My electric bill for the last few months? 1400 DT. This is Tunisian bullshit that someone feels entitled to... Because I'm white (?)... So I must have money (?)... So stealing from me should be fine (?) 👈 do you now begin to see why I feel entitled to a higher salary? If Tunisians didn't bump up prices and mistreat me economically and otherwise, maybe I'd settle with what I have now

Tunisiawas making a profit when it was able to take care of the safety of British and other Western tourists but now seeing as it is incapable of doing that, it should take what it is given: including the cheap Russians that would otherwise go to Syria and Afghanistan (that's an actual thing)

I'm being brutally honest and a lot of people are being butthurt. If I tell them that nearly every taxi driver tries to fuck me over, their response is ""don't be white"", not ""sorry to hear about your negative experience, we do not condone this""

The last time I specified who I was and who I knew, I had a lot of problems from the person and a little backlash so I would rather not specify but I am more aware than the average Tunisian. I tried helping people make Ukrainian visas and a moderator on this subreddit reported me to the British Embassy for allegedly helping smuggling people into the UK. I had problems for a long while afterwards.

I am done with being polite and humanitarian towards Tunisians. If you respect me, I will respect you. Try shit with me and I will write your tag number down and get your badge taken away from you. Fuck you and your livelihood lmfao",2019-05-22 14:34:26

French wanted to spread their culture under the so called “civilizing missions” by sending missionaries and spreading their language. Whereas Britain just wanted to make money and didn’t really care about spreading British culture, language or religion. For example when Egypt was under them they basically ruled because of the Suez channel which was making money for them same goes for India. When it came to French regardless where they colonized they imposed their culture especially language on the people. I mean Djibouti which wasn’t settler colony like Algeria yet they made sure the locals learned French, acted French etc.

The French brought the system of democracy which the Algerians did not wish to accept and instead fought for their Islamic way of governance. A revolution happened and a secular government led by Boutef replaced and ruled over the Islamist factions. You basically got French laws in the end but with a tonne of corruption and restrictions on alcohol, homosexuality and out of marriage relationships.

Bourguiba, who made Tunisia what it is today, was educated by the French. He translated the ""French way of life"" textbook into Arabic and made life without knowledge of French difficult in Tunisia (you've destroyed the European-era universities and replaced them with those named after tyrants - ""Mohammad V University in Morocco"", etc - once again, only to have lessons taught mostly in French.

What did the English do? They gave the right of free movement to Indians and Pakis (when it was one country). Did any former British colonial subjects move to the UK, better themselves and then their countries of origin? Nope. Nope for the West Indies. A Nope for Africa and a Nope for India and it's neighbouring artificial entities. Mashallah, they kept the locals to their own devices.

The Arab culture itself after Islam is made and influenced by the cultures of the assimilated nations and other outisde cultures mainly Greek, Indian, Persian and Chinese, this is basic history 101.

Ethnicity and culture have nothing to do with each other, if you go that way it becomes racism.

&amp;#x200B;

Alot of our food is shared with the rest of the Arab world, and even non-arab middle eastern countries like Pakistan and Iran.

Foods like Mloukhia, chakchouka, rice, mhalbiya, marka, tabouna, tajin (prepared a little differently in each country) etc.. 

Our unique foods are couscous, dro3, zgougou, brik, slata mechwia, kafteji, etc.. 

Most of our sweets are turkish.

Our clothes are unique to us but similar to some Arab countries in the east , especially traditional clothes of people from the country side. 

Architecture is a mix of Roman, Arab and Berber elements, and others.

Our history after Islam is in no doubt interconnected, you can't deny this one, even before Islam Tunisia and parts of North Africa had many ties with the levant and Egypt.

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to call Maghrebins as non-arabs that's fine, but you can't call them berber either, because we are neither, we are just Maghrebins and we share a culture that is influenced by many other cultures.

People that can truly be called Berber are villages that still use Tamazigh, chelha and other berber languages as their native tongue and Arabic as their second language, they also have a more authentic berber culture, these are mainly found in Morroco and Algeria, mainly in deserts and mountains, in Tunisia there are only hundreds of people still concerving it as a main culture.

I am a resident, tax-payer and soon to be citizen of Tunisia. I am a Christian, so yes, a religious minority. I take my religion seriously and am ready to die to be able to perform all of the duties (including those that I do not perform right now).

Joining France - read carefully - join France, as in, become a part of France like Algeria was pre-1960, operating entirely under French law - is not colonialism as Tunisians would have the same privileges and obligations (not as ""indigenous"" citizens but as fully-fledged French citizens) as mainland, ethnic French citizens.

France controls you now. Tunisia is not France and so the 7-something euro per hour minimum wage does not apply to you. French companies can bury nuclear waste out in the desert and ecological obligations put in place by the EU do not apply here. Your salt is being sold for pennies per the tonne, sold for a tenner per kilo in French stores and the profits are taxed while tax revenue benefits the French state.

Becoming French would mean that your roads (which are actually quite good), schools, universities, health care, infrastructure would have to meet minimum requirements. It would be an obligatory expense for the French state.

Tunisians have been left to their own devices since 1956 and in the real meaning of ""independence"" (or the illusion of it) since 2011. I think that having oversight from a more developed country would help the average citizen. Mayotte is Comoros but controlled by France and hundreds of Comorians die on their way to another part of their country occupied by France as living as illegals in Mayotte is better than live in Comoros. So I guess, yeah... France is fucking you over now. At least you can tie them down into owing you reparations which you aren't getting now.

A world government does not work. If I was the leader of the world government, Muslim countries would no longer be Muslim. I would disagree with the leaders of the member states about their cultural practises. Take Afghanistan - they practise ""bacha bazi"" - boy rape, essentially, due to a lack of access to women. I wouldn't want people with these ideas coming into Sweden or Russia. I would order mass killings of anyone who supports or enables this practise.

The problem is that I have enough money to survive in Tunisia and live in a nice, safe area, and to eat and go out to coffees and meet new people and talk to them, but not to charter private jets, bungee jump, etc.

In Tunisia, if I make a few grand (USD), that's enough to last me a few months. In Europe, that's not enough for two weeks with my spending habits. I am trying to ""crack the business code"" and find the thing that'll make me millions. The wife, at this point, has been nothing but an annoying never ending notification telling me how shit life has been. I used to spend 300-500TND a day, buy drinks for everyone, etc but after we got married, that dissolved.

I love Tunisia because I just do. Why do some guys like Brazil, Thailand, Mexico, etc. It be like that.

I get really depressed sometimes, especially after series of sequential unfortunate events. I would rather be in Tunisia sitting with a Tunisian guy smoking chicha than in rainy England.

No offense but you're lying, Tunisian arabic isn't a separate language, it's a dialect and people here learn arabic from the first day in school, watched Arabic cartoons their entire childhood and even when they are born their parents spoke arabic to them, so unless you live outside of the country, you're not an exception no matter how many times you deny it, oh and not knowing few words doesn't mean you're ignorant of arabic, it doesn't have to be memorizing a whole dictionary for for god's sake

Yeah, maybe you didn't really notice it yet

&gt; Even if it's like father and son, I think the specificity is important. Not everyone knows about it.

Specificity by saying Tunisian is a separate language even though it's still 90% Arabic ? need a dictionary to show you ?

&gt; Stereotypes are part of humanity. Being specific, also helps not lose our memory. Words are charged with history, cultures, heritage. I insist on being specific not because of hatred, but for Memory's sake and to prevent having our heritage lost to either big culture ( whether it's the east or the west! I don't discriminate)

Do you even know what do i mean by it ? like saying all jews wear black long hat is okay to you ? do you even know what you're talking about ?

&gt; Overall, i agree with you on the conclusion of this reply. We should focus on our languages, by giving a better place to amazing, and also by improving our derja in a written format for accessibility to every single citizen rather than focus on literary arabic that is only available to those educated. The educational system needs a reform, and French and English both should have a place in our administrations at least, to cater to foreigners but also to Tunisians that have bi-national parents as well as those having received a french education.

I see, you're simply an ultranationalist and a bigot, oh well, good luck with your wish, because it will never happen, it's just because the people will never agree, just go ask someone and you will see and when i said language, i'm talking about working, living, useful languages that are part of our culture and heritage, Arabic and Amazigh, those two have enormous benefits more than trying to separate a dialect from a language, a set of dialect, not even one unified dialect, Arabic will connect us to a large part of history and people, Amazigh is the same case, but let's say we all agree on this silly idea of turning Tunisian arabic into a separate language, which one would we take ? the southern dialect ? the northern one ? the one in Sfax or Karknah ? oh boy this is going to start an ugly civil war, go read that article please

And finally, this isn't a debate, it's just a simple online discussion but yeah, it was fun, what matters the most is we respect each other, sorry if i sounded rude, i didn't mean to be that way",2019-09-07 12:35:25

I really don't get it why most people here understand my statement in the total opposite way...

Of course i don't expect our president to be the next JFK, but am afraid of having the next Gaddafi or Saddam! so when i said international relations, i wasn't talking about making them stronger, i was talking of the danger of fucking it completely with a populist like Kais. 

&gt; Which one comes first should come first, the economic stability and growth or the respect internationally?

**BOTH!!**, and you can't have one without the other, these populist (often islamist) always use Malaysia as their prime example, but none of them mention this (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_Malaysia#Foreign_policy_since_1969))

&gt; Malaysia shifted its policy towards non-alignment and neutrality. Malaysia's foreign policy is officially based on the principle of neutrality and maintaining peaceful relations with all countries, regardless of their ideology or political system, and to further develop relations with other countries in the region.


Someone like Kais or Saif Makhlouf doesn't strike me as a neutral, they all talk with a big ""revenge"" background and how we need to ""fuck France back"" and ""**GET OUR SALT**"" .

f1ln2lj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/d9270k/,0,"Yawn. Typical knee-jerk atheist reply full of shallow misrepresentation and delusional nonsense. Going off on a tangent about development?! Laughable rubbish. Countries being developed have nothing to do with atheism or so-called progressiveness. It has everything to do with dividends of empire, predatory economics models and global exploitation of resources etc. You have no idea what you’re babbling about. Pick up a history book sometime when you’re not wasting your life on Reddit shouting in an echo chamber.  You’re going after low hanging fruit by bringing up Saudi Arabia like the predictable lazy atheist that you are thinking that corrupt secular monarchy created by Britain represents Islam. It does not, but you would have know some history about the subject which you so sadly do not. Muslims have no love for that wicked kingdom. But here’s the real question : So why is Tunisia a banana republic After several decades of state and vicious  secular dictatorships and Eurocentric brainwashing? where has licking European boots gotten you after more than nearly 70 years of “independence”? Your mindset reminds me of a quote made by a great American Muslim civil rights hero, Malcolm X who said “ only a fool allows his enemy to educate his child.”

The reality is that atheism has nothing to do with science, development or deep thinking of any sort. It’s a cheap and convenient cop out by lazy shallow unintelligent types. Not very “progressive” of you to tell me to go elsewhere. Of course you’re an islamophobe so you would say that.  Not surprised that you’re frequent the notorious anti-Muslim “ex-Muslim” hate sub. Typical.

This would indicate to me that there's a trust issue with internet security firms and major retailers (which would include PayPal, Square, Venmo, etc.)

f4a60cl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/djzw9y/,0,"There’s a whole theory that one of the big things driving people away from religion in the US and Europe is that it become politicized. In much of Western Europe, religion was politicized in the 19th century and early 20th with the rise of socialism/social democracy as the opposition to conservatism. In America, this change didn’t happen until the 1980’s. The theory goes that a lot of people in the opposite party go, “If that’s what religion is—those crazy guys over there—then okay fine I’m not religious.” By politicizing religion, it pushes away those who aren’t fans of religion. 

I’ve followed the data for Turkey (a religiously based socially conservative party has been in power since 2002) and it’s shown the same thing and I’ve been eager for post-Arab Spring data on the Arab world because almost always, as political systems have opened up in the Arab world, the main conservative party has been a Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated or -inspired party, sometimes augmented with a Salafi Party (Nur in Egypt; I don’t think anything in Tunisia). While the hodgepodge of liberal and pro-old regime parties that have sprung often aren’t *anti-*religious, people who support those parties (especially young people with more fluid preferences) begin associating religion with “those guys over there” and stop identifying as religious. This will probably be one of the most important trends in Arab world over the 20th century.

In places where we see sectarian conflict—Iraq, Yemen—we don’t see this at all. If you’re a mostly secular Sunni, you’re still Sunni in Iraq’s politics whereas if you’re a mostly secular Sunni in Tunisia, you’re mostly secular.",2019-10-19 12:50:43

I believe ,at least, you should just get your bacalaureat: that will be better than nothing.

If you have issues at school , try to fix them one by one. like IDK for example if you get problems with the school administration (about behaviour), make a written apology.

If you have problems with your parents , try to go to the psychologist

however , depression &amp; stress have already a cure which are activities, activities that can fill your time and make you forget about difficulties. those activities aren't video games or  surfing on the internet. I mean activities like sport , meditation , reading books and attending events. some activities that really help you fight depression and stress.

I’m much older than you, and I can tell you this, I regret not seeking help earlier, I wasted a lot of years, that now after I improved my situation I look at with total regret. Don’t waste time, you’re not alone in what’s happening to you, be better than me, go seek help as early as you can, and when you do, think of the person treating you as someone who’s on your team, give him or her as much feedback as you can, if they ask you to do something which seems like a big task, tell them you can’t at this stage, be as honest as you can to avoid wasting more time. I was your age and I understand that it is not as easy to be comfortable and open up, but it would really help you if you drop any defense mechanisms with the professional treating you, i know a lot of people who wasted even more time by not thinking of the doctor or whoever is treating you professionally as someone who’s on your team.

Stop being stupid, it's China, a country with one of the worst human rights record in the world. It's quite obvious China has used torture, merely being imprisoned without trial and having your culture taken from you is a form of torture. You really like the smell of Chinese arse don't you. 

&gt;Yes, I would think so. The Americans also released some of the Muslims they tortured for years, while nobody cared. 

Yes, good observation, America also didn't release them back into America, nor did they detain up to three million people, and when they did, it was in Cuba or the Middle East, not Utah or Pennsylvania. 

&gt;Maybe, generally speaking I think China can succeed with erasing the Uighur Culture. 

It really sounds like you want this to happen? But you're wrong, this will only drive people closer to the Uighur cause, whilst radicalising the Uighurs and other Turkic groups. 

&gt;The Chinese government tries to avoid bad press

Looool, umm no... They just repress it or put it in a reeducation camp. 

&gt;People like you are the reason why the US gets away with a Drone Strike Genocide of Muslims

Yea I pushed the button myself

&gt;why the US gets away with capturing innocent Muslims around the World and putting them into torture camps

I's not quite the same scale as China though is it. The USA imprisoned at most, tens of thousands, China has up to three million. ""There's no evidence America used torture"". 

&gt;People like you try to live comfortable

Lol I wish 

&gt;People like you don't try to fight the enemy.

So what, you want everyone to blow themselves up in New York or something? Is that what you'd like?

Except we don't speak the same language, it's like saying french, Spanish, Romanian and Portuguese are all the same language because they're Latin. ME arabs can barely understand us, there's a paper online which i will try to find that lists every tunisian word of amazigh origin and there are A LOT! About 30% of our dialect comes from shelha. Celebrate the same holidays? Pakistanis and Senegalese celebrate the same holidays as well.. does that make them arab? You realise that Somalia and Djibouti are also classed as Arab even though they're not ethnically Arab. Arab is an ethnicity and a culture. Look at in the same was as Hispanic, you can still have black hispanic people even though their ethnicity is not of Spanish origin  
Same morals...? Looool I barely know any tunisians that pray, most tunisians I know drink and have sex before marriage, if you think North Africans and Middle Eastern arabs have the same morals you've been living under a rock my friend. Maybe we have similar morals to Lebanese but that's about it. Same religion...? South Africans and Swedes are both majority Christian does that means they're the same ethnicity? 

If you look at the Wikipedia article on Maghrebis you will see we are considered Arabised barbers, our culture has largely been influenced by arabs but we are not genetically arab, our culture has also been heavily influenced by Turks, Europeans and other parts of Africa. 

&gt;Did you just define Tunisian by their skin colour

Well yes, because we are discussing identity and ethnicity. Your definition of racism is warped, black tunisians are ethnically different to Amazigh tunisians that's a fact it's not racism, doesn't make either group any less tunisian, black, white, brown, olive, if you're tunisian you're tunisian, period. It's true black tunisians suffer racism here but the situation is improving gradually, please don't call me a racist, I spent my entire life living with black British people, my gf is black, my son half black, and 1/4 of my family is from Mali, I have more in common with black people in Europe than i do with north Africans, I'm a Pan-Africanist so be careful before you slander people like that... 

&gt;I think you are mixing culture and ethnicity dude

Our culture is a mix of Arab, Greater African, Amazighi, Southern European and Turkish. ALL or most tunisians are partially culturally arab, black, brown, and white, if you speak 'Darja' (Tunisian Arabic, I use the term arabic loosely) then you are partially culturally arab by default. On the other hand, as i said, the ethnic makeup of Tunisia is a combination of Amazighi, Black Tunisian (who are distinct from other black Africans) Turco-tunisian, ethnic arab and Southern European. 

I hope maybe I have educated you a bit today but with all due respect YOU are part of the problem. People like YOU are the reason the indigenous culture of North Africa has been suppressed and almost exterminated, people like YOU have contributed to the cultural genocide of North Africa. People like YOU are misinformed, and THAT is what created disdain and racism in Tunisia. If you are tunisian or north African then i plead that you actually study your own history and understand there is only a small chance you're ethnically Arab. When the Arabs invaded north africa, the amazighi went to the mountains and so the Arabs and Berbers didn't really mix at all. My friend, open a book, make your own decision rather than just being part of a hive mind that labels 200 million people as the same. Come to your own conclusions. I hope I've shed some light on this subject for you and others. P.s I have nothing against arabs (for the most part) but I don't enjoy an entire region being mislabelled.

eyxdep6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/cyiyll/,-1,"&gt;You are confusing dialects and languages my dear. What you did list is a subgroup of the Italic languages within the Indo-European language family. Get your facts strait. I speak fluent french, but that does not mean I can understand belgians when they speak french.

Sorry but that's subjective, at what point does a dialect become it's own language? Maltese is very similar to Tunisian and comes from the Arabic language family but Maltese is still considered it's own language. If Arabs don't understand us and we have our own writing and speaking patterns, then does that not qualify Maghrebi dialects as their own language. Also you are being extremely patronising, if you aren't north African (I'm assuming) then what gives you the right to label and identify us how you see fit? If you're north African, you're brainwashed. Also, Belgian french and French french are mutually intelligible, how can you not understand Belgians? Are you a native french speaker? 

&gt;And therefore forget the major influence of arabs in tunisian culture.

I didn't dispute the impact of Arab imperialism on north African culture, today it is more culturally arab than amazigh in most parts but genetically speaking, Middle Eastern Arabs are different to North Africans, many ME Arabs don't even consider us Arab 

Just because we have some aspects of Arab culture doesn't mean we are arab, by the same definition, a lot of Kurds in arab nations adopt arab customs and the language, would you class them as Arab? 

&gt;Are you talking about religion ? I am confused. You are confusing (again) moral and religion my dear: Morality (from Latin: moralis, lit. 'manner, character, proper behavior') is the differentiation of intentions, decisions and actions between those that are distinguished as proper and those that are improper.

&gt;Even if I want to follow your logic, the fact that you are doing it, doesnt mean it's not considered wrong by your society.

Regardless, you've proven nothing, like I said, just because we share the same religion doesn't make us the same group of people, so because west Africa is largely Muslim that means they are also arab right..? The key difference you are missing and what I was trying to get at was that Middle Eastern Arabs tend to be much more conservative than north Africans, but it's a moot point because there are arabs who are not Muslim as well and north Africans who are not Muslim, religion isn't synonymous with ethnicity, race or even culture. 

How do you know our society considers it wrong, tunisia especially is known for being socially secular, recently there has been an increase in the number or Islamist and people becoming religious but I'd say tunisia as a whole is predominantly Muslim by name as convenience, we observe Ramadan and eid, believe in God but tunisians who pray 5 times a day are few and far between. 

&gt;I am not even going to ask you for proof, since you can't even define ethnicity and you dont know how to distinguish culture, genetical heritage and ethnicity. I invite you to read this research article if you want to explore North African genetic heritage: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5084816/

You didn't ask but here it is:
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_groups_of_Africa

Just as i said, sure we have arabs, but the majority are ethnic amazigh, most Arabs in Africa can be found in Egypt (even though Egyptians are actually their own separate group entirely from arabs and amazighi), a lesser extent tunisia and Libya and within Sudan and Somalia (but heavily mixed with bantu) 

I'm interested as to why you're so bothered how we identify ourselves if you aren't from NA or Tn? Like I said originally, north africa has been arab-washed and our history and identity suppressed, people like you contribute to that and why we are oppressed in our own countries by our own people. ",2019-09-03 22:42:37

he's clean and not corrupt because he probably didn't had the chance to be, there were other clean candidat with better presence than him (Safi, Abbo, Hamma, Rahoui).

IMO, people voted him because he simply wasn't playing the classic politic game, no one can deny that everyone of us, specially the youth, hates every single politician out there, Kais simply wasn't a politician, and he had a lot of points from many departments, he is:  

* well educated

* Mysterious

* Perfect for conspiracy theorists (Psyco M-likes)

* Not a salafist but also not a ""neo-liberal"" (à la Maya ksouri), he represent the typical tunisian who drink all year long except in Ramadan &amp; ma yrabrabch nhar jem3a

* the way he speaks make it sounds like he isn't giving fake promises. 

&amp;nbsp;

does this make him a good candidat for presidency ? am not sure, i wont be voting for anyone in the 2nd tour, what i know for sure though, that the  result of this election are the **perfect** wake up call for all politicians in the country.

&amp;nbsp;

now whether Kais end up doing good or not, i honestly don't care, i know for sure that Tunisia is far from falling into a catastrophic situation (civil war or something more violent), so what's the worst that can happen ? 

The dinar will get more fucked than it actually is, and personally, as selfish and arrogant as this gonna sound, i don't give a single fuck xD am what we call ""korza"" and i get paid in $, soooo i actually totally approve of this post, this new meme-generator of president is gonna be super fun to watch :')",2019-09-19 06:12:36

If they have a retrospective payment contract with TC then the hotels cannot hold guests against their will and demand money by menaces for a previous period.   

The hotels would be within their right to announce to the guests that **going forward** all services must be paid for in cash by the guests if they wish to remain in the hotel, otherwise, if they do not wish to stay any longer, the guests are free to leave.

I think you're not aware of the Venezuelan crisis and people fleeing their country (around a million of them in 2019 only) heading to the States, due to very poor economic and humanitarian conditions. From your own perspective it's a useless country to ban, from theirs it is not. And we all know why North Korea has been banned too.

Almost half of Tchad's population is non-muslim, so I am not sure the label ""muslim country"" fits here.

Now I did not deny Trump and his administration are hostile towards muslims, but it's also hostile towards other ethnic groups/religions. There's an obvious rise of xenophobia in the USA.

fax5131,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/eaifol/,-1,"&gt;Why would it matter if it's cultural genocide or genocide?  

Because there is a difference between killing people and erasing their culture???  
Also, Historically speaking, if there is a genocide- people will care about it at some point of time. Even if its 5 years after it happened.  
A cultural genocide on the other hand usually doesn't bother people quiet that much. Even 20 years ago there was [still a cultural genocide happening in the west](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Indian_residential_school_system).    

&gt;Muslims who have been tortured and imprisoned for God knows how long  

We don't have any evidence for torturing.  

&gt;You think ... they release millions of Muslims ... been tortured and imprisoned ...

Yes, I would think so. The Americans also released some of the Muslims they [tortured](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-A9w9-dSD1-k/U6RajTvIuxI/AAAAAAAAHc8/rqgMYkUQyaQ/s1600/abughraibhood.gif) for years, while nobody cared.  

&gt;at this point the Uyghurs will probably start a new separatist insurgency

Maybe, generally speaking I think China can succeed with erasing the Uighur Culture.   

&gt;China is either going to hold them indefinitely, or slaughter them and sell their organs   

Could be, generally speaking the West doesn't care that much about Muslims so it could happen. The Chinese government tries to avoid bad press, so they will probably not genocide millions of Muslims. 

&gt;To answer OP, it's exactly people like this that are the reason China can get away with the shit it does.

Because I give more nuance to a subject than some propaganda the West tries to push?  
People like you are the reason why the US gets away with a Drone Strike Genocide of Muslims, why the US gets away with capturing innocent Muslims around the World and putting them into torture camps, people like you are the reason why the US gets away with funding political Islamist's, who have nothing to do with Islam, which in turn kill thousands of Muslims.  

People like you don't try to find the truth. People like you try to live comfortable, getting their so called information as little pre chewed appetizers pushed down their throats.  

People like you don't try to fight the enemy. People like you try to live as opportunists, with all the benefits coming with it, throwing around their fake morality- as soon as the enemies requires them to do so. Instead of having a nuanced view of the World around them, fighting against all injustice they encounter.",2019-12-15 03:00:31

f0o9et5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/d5rosz/,-3,"You re thinking far too much in the short term. I want Tunisia as a whole to be a better country in the long term. 

Here is why I am for Karoui's elections : 

Karoui is interested in two things : money and protecting the rich.

This means that he ll probably give concessions on the law realm. Things like equal inheritance or even homosexuality to hide and undermine things related to money.

His election is a nice opportunity to trade money into long term advantages in law.

Another important thing is the white/black view of Tunisians. I want my people to stop believe in a white armoured hero that comes to save them. Karoui's election is a lesson taught the hard way. 
This will improve the Tunisian mentality as a whole imo.  And people might finally start looking at programs rather than who shouts louder.


On the other side, Said is great in the short term. We won't suffer that much economically and law won't change much.

This means that Tunisians are taught the wrong lessons. Conservatism is being linked with economic prosperity and People start believing more in the ""hero"" thing. 

Finally, Said is a difficult prey to get down at the next elections while Nabil Karoui wants to be elected once and strike even richer.

This means that NIDA (which will hopefully ally again at the next elections) will have a harder time winning against Said than Karoui.

Fundamentally, my vision for Tunisia is focused on the long term. 5 years of suffering is enormous but a great country cannot be built if lessons are not taught the hard way.",2019-09-18 10:32:45

Their children don't have prospects because of their lack of will or knowledge. It is not my responsibility to give you something because you cannot come up with a way to acquire it yourself.

For your information, of all the nationalities that cannot be hired in the Gulf (Syrians, as an example, being banned from recieving Kuwaiti iqamas), Bangladeshis, Indians and Pakistanis easily send back $500 a month if they work in labour camps in the Gulf. This is more than enough to send your kid to a private elementary and secondary school. It's really not survival of the fittest difficult to get your kid into a good university thereafter. You won't get $10,000+ a month like a Brit living in Dubai, but with a good degree and experience in an Indian/Bangladeshi/Pakistani university, you can work your way into a job in a developed, westernised country where you can have adequate offspring. It'll take 2-3 generations, but it can be done, and it isn't the white man's responsibility that he's been on earth for the same amount of years as the non-white man but has managed to come with cures for cancer and build planes while Africa and the rest of the world is in a perpetual civil war of sorts.",2019-07-04 20:01:31

And yes, both I and my partner (a Tunisian) do not find all Tunisians to be equally capable of respect and dignity towards one another. The Russian ruling elite takes it's children away from Russia as soon as possible. It does not make them racists.

I said that any multinational has the right to hire from it's country of origin if it cannot find adequate local workers. The British school in Tunisia cannot find adequate native-to-Tunisia-yet-native-in-British-English speakers in Tunisia. This is painful for you to be aware of, not so much for me.

If you like to be serviced by freret at hotels, that's on you. I like my hoteliers classy. I have yet to find a successful, well-mannered Tunisian moving to Nabeul or Hammamet to work in the hospitality industry (why would he, if he can work in Tunis/Marsa for twice the salary?). I didn't say that Tunisians were cockroaches. Perhaps you misunderstood. I like my rental car tires inflated, fuel tank full. I like my plane trip to be without turbulence. If you can compromise on comfort... that, my friend, is on you

I couldn't have spelt out any racial hierarchy (?) for one simple reason: both Tunisians and I are Caucasian - one race. There goes your attempt at a race bait. Without foreign capital (in the form of tourism), your country would fall (economically) to the level of Gambia. Doesn't mean the people are bad, but the country wouldn't be a nice place to live in. ""He who feeds you, controls (owns) you"". The tourists pay, and it is they who order your music. 

That doesn't make them 'better' than you... It just means that in a country where the government doesn't give unemployment handouts, if there is no work (and there will be no work if there are no tourists, and there won't be any unless you can make them feel at home. something only someone from 'home' [the bit where I come in] can make them feel)

I feel like a Jew telling you ""but we will only eat kosher meat"" and you (a Muslim or otherwise) telling me ""no, you are a Jewish supremacist, halal/vegetarian will be just fine for you"". Keep to your opinion, you'll just loose out on an audience.lol

I am 20. I have a high school diploma and a vocational diploma. You are 18 + 4-6 years of studies and can *only* make 8k TND - about £2100 a month.

Currently the minimum salary in London and the whole of United Kingdom is of £7.50 per hour for those aged 25 or older. Considering that the working week in the UK has usually 40 hours, and the average number of working days per month is 22, the minimum salary in the UK is usually around £ 1320 pounds.

The average net salary in London is currently between 2000 and 2500 GBP per month net for most professions.

I could return to the UK and work in *McDonalds* and make more than you while you sweat, moan and groan every day, making use of Tunisia's maximal academic capacity. This is what I meant by Tunisians being uncapable of doing simple jobs for multinational companies.

You've just demonstrated how dire your, and by extent, Tunisia's situation is. I am in Tunisia because I like it here, because I want to be with my partner's family, but I am also very bored of having a regular income that allows me to survive but leaves me really bored. I have expenses that I used to be able to pull previously but now cannot.

Once again, if you cannot contribute to the job search, spectate quietly. Just because my opportunities are better than yours, it does not mean that I am racist.",2019-05-22 03:51:29

How much equity can you release from it? Are you willing to remortgage the house and with the equity (in cash form) buy something in Tunisia which, in the meanwhile, can be rented out to cover repayments?

Tunisian property - in terms of returns on investment - is a shit choice. You can buy it for capital appreciation but if you have the capital to buy a house in Tunisia, there are better things you can spend this money on.

If you want to be in Tunisia for the novelty of Tunisia, read on:

I got a good deal on a 50m-away-from-the-beach S+1 appartment in Gammarth from a shitty landlord at 950 TND a month - about $330 US.

A thousand Canadian dollars is 766-ish. You'd be spending about half of your monthly income on rent in a shitty S+1. Fine for an elderly couple. There is more to rent than the rent itself - there are utilities. I managed to get a contract that said that it was the landlord had to pay utilities. The landlord does not like this and tried to get me evicted (against the law). I am in the process of fighting this (successfully) and have access to the apartment until the contract ends (October) - but this is a once in a blue moon. There is no way you'll get something like this for this price.

I can't imagine myself living in Menzel Bourguiba and the like. If your parents want to retire in their hood, or if they have a family house, they don't need to worry about accomodation. $760 leaves you with $22-23 a day on food. Enough for a couple (that's about 70 TND at today's rates).

Why don't you, the capable son, provide for your parents? They've given you a better life in Canada. Stop being lazy and ungreatful and get your grind on. You can get a personal loan for $50k, buy a holiday property right before the touristic season starts and rent it out on AirBnb/other venues and have that income pay off your personal loan. When the property appreciates in the few years that you're doing this, you can sell it/swap it for another house.",2019-07-13 19:13:42

They don't need to come to Libya and try to swim to Italy. They are safe in Bangladesh. The Bangladeshi government rightfully offers them the right to voluntarily repatriate if they cannot afford a flight back home.

Their depression/discontent with their lands is not our problem.

eoeeitu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/bri4nh/,-9,"So much butt hurt and not an actual reply to what I am asking about.

Multinational companies are doing the Tunisian economy and, by extension, you, the favor of even wanting to open shop here. If they deem your population to be incapable of doing simple tasks, you have to re-evaluate direction in which your nation is heading and not be sour at me for being able to do what you cannot.

I don't know how aware of the world outside of your 11 million people you are, but Russians feel uncomfortable with people, in most cases, even from the Caucasian former Soviet Union Republics, let alone Tunisians who have a tendency as a people to be against one another in times of national crisis.

You wouldn't want a hotel room with cockroaches and likewise I assure you that the biggest clientele (Russian) for the biggest industry that keeps Tunisia alive (tourism) wouldn't want an edgy street peddler with a thick accent to provide services for them. They want an actual Russian.

Source: I started a course in travel and tourism in the UK but left about half way through it, I am a Russian and I have discussed co-operating with Russian tour operators to send tourists to Tunisia before.

If you have nothing of value to add... like, information on where I can find a job with my requirements, please do not respond. If you don't like how your country works, vote, bomb, revolution or coup about a change.

Prove it, and show that action has been taken so it will not happen again. Tunisia (minister of tourism(?)) needs to act quickly to put out a press statement that action has been taken to allow people to leave the hotels and are no longer being bullied into paying for what they are not liable for.

And the tourists are not victims?  The hotel's actions which were illegal, have caused a lot of damage to Tunisia's reputation.  

The hotel is a victim but has now become a criminal.  What is Tunisia doing about it?",2019-09-22 12:34:30
