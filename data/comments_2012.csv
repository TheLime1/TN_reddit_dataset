c799rst,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/140tch/,3,"as long as you arent going to the south or the western north part of Tunisia, I think you will be ok! Nabeul isnt that great of a city, but they have pottery markets that you must check out, [link](http://cecilimages.photoshelter.com/gallery/-/G0000PoQVR0so4EA/1). Hammamet isnt away from Nabeul and it is a more active, more attractive city, there you could check the ""old"" part of the city, near Ribat el [Hammamet], (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammamet,_Tunisia), or the touristic side of it ""[Yasmine El Hammamet](http://wikimapia.org/1417906/Yasmine-Hammamet)"". 

I live in Sousse, which is a pretty active touristic city on the same side of the east coast (it is only 45 min car drive away from Nabeul, you could take a cab for about only 3 dollars to get there). There you could find almost everything you would want, nice restaurants, cafés, museums, parks, shopping centers.

If you need to have more specific information, I'd be glad to help out. I am a native tunisian.

Just one more thing, if you were able to stay longer in Tunis, make sure to visit [Sidi Bousaid](https://www.google.tn/search?q=sidi+bousaid+tunis&amp;hl=en&amp;tbo=d&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BRS5UM_3KcSS0QXPw4D4Cg&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAA&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667) I think it is a city that shows off the best of the tunisian landscapes.",2012-11-30 20:17:18

c7es65z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/14mipb/,3,"Brick is quite simple and very Tunisian food, traditionally we eat it in Ramadan, but I'm sure any expat will enjoy it anytime.
You can find the recipe [here](http://emilyk.typepad.com/whats_for_lunch/2006/09/lunch_in_tunisi.html) with a lot of pictures to show you how to do it. Just two remarks:  
1- don't use onions (as the author did) instead use chopped/minced cheese (Edam, Gouda or any yellow sort that melt easily)  
2- You may not find the sheets of brick if you don't live in France, you can use instead (the better) [spring roll pastery](http://www.orientalsuper-mart.com/ourstore/images/items/TJYSpringRollSml.jpg) which can be found in any developed country in the asian supermarkt.   
  
Last and most importantly, don't forget the lemon, bricks taste bad without lemons, so NEVER EVER forget the lemons. Enjoy!",2012-12-11 13:14:01

If she was to stay for more than a week, I could have suggested for her to use ""[Orange's USB internet everwhere](http://www.orange.tn/offre-internet/cid652-internet-everywhere-pr-epay-e.html?rpid=424)"", it costs about 90 dinars to be bought, and 30 dinars to charge it.
