The main purpose of it, was to make a simple joke about our sub rule number 4: Do not use all caps in titles..

And fortunately many of you understood it (thx mod for allowing it, you are the real hero, for the people who sill have a humor in them and who upvoted)

Second of all, you don't have to be a buzz kill, and show us your knowledge about politics and religion and what not, you guys get triggered so fast and don't see the big picture. It was not a politic discussion in the first place. Your comments were soo 'bizarre'(fb style!), i didn't thought it will get that reaction honestly, specialty from some redditors here. 

Your comments shows what type of person you are, respect others and be civil, even if you don't share the same thoughts. za7, ta7kiw nhar kemil twensa mayesta3mlouch reddit w dra chnowa.. star rabi mahomech lena, w ntouma eli jeybinha ^9afzin w ta3mlou haka. 

&amp;nbsp;

lastly you need to chill the fuck up, and try to recognize whats a real debate and whats a fun harmless amusement, and don't use your pitchfork, or you will get a hard time here and reddit overall. 

&amp;nbsp;

Or maybe reddit is too advanced for you. ^cya ^later ^virgins.",,,,,,2020-01-07 15:25:25

emds5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/emds5m/,7,Carthage 2.0 ?,"Hey, 
I have been reading a manga called Kingdom recently. It tells the tale of the unification of ancient china into the qin dynasty. China was a territory compromised of really similar but also different 7 states which had their own monarchs ruling over them. I cant help but draw a parallel to this story. 
I dont think the unification of all arab countries is a very good idea since the countries are really different and the common point is mostly only Islam. For example Saudi arabia and Morocco are as different as Russia and france and I don't think it's a wise idea to merge these pairs. But Algeria, tunisia and libya are extremely similar. The difference between someone from Tunis and someone from Tataouine is even bigger than the difference between that man from Tunis and a man from Algiers. So could the unification of these three countries ever occur ? If so do you think the new country will be more powerful or will it eat itself from the inside out ?",,,,,,2020-01-09 18:32:16

eo46ol,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/eo46ol/,14,This is an interesting read /Report From Vice President Humphrey to President Johnson,"
 I visited nine African countries between December 30, 1967, and January 11, 1968: Ivory Coast, Liberia (for the inauguration ceremonies of President Tubman), Ghana, Congo (K), Zambia, Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya and Tunisia.

‚ÄúTunisia was the high point of my visit to Africa.

President Bourguiba, who expressed his firm friendship and admiration for the United States and for you personally, is an historic figure among the leaders of his generation.

He is one of the few revolutionaries of the post-war world who has‚Äîafter his nation‚Äôs independence was won‚Äîalso proved his capacity for governing. Tunisia is poor by American standards. But her human and material resources are under systematic development. She has an established layer of trained leadership. And the country is filled with forward movement and dynamism.

In my long conversation with Bourguiba, he expressed himself openly and vigorously. He has a caustic disdain for Nasser and believes we have been mistaken in past assistance to him (‚ÄúNasser is a gangster and rules by fear‚Äù). He feels we are finally convincing North Vietnam that we will not withdraw from the struggle there (‚ÄúThey know there will not be another Dienbienphu‚Äù) and that Hanoi may soon be ready for [Page 403]negotiation. He is willing to play the role of honest broker in the Middle East, in Vietnam, in the Congo and elsewhere in the world where his stature among the ‚Äúunaligned‚Äù nations is unchallengeable.

He specifically suggested that direct Israeli-Palestinian talks be undertaken as a realistic way out of the Middle East impasse. You may wish to discuss this with him.

He feels that this crisis can be peacefully overcome. He is less confident about the situation in the Maghreb (Libya, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia). He is obviously concerned about the proximity of so much Soviet arms and influence in Algeria.

In my talks with economic officials‚Äîand in my visit to the agricultural area of the Medjerda valley‚ÄîI was impressed by Tunisia‚Äôs capacity to use our assistance well. Our P.L. 480 Food for Freedom Program is a vital factor in the public works programs, urban and rural. ‚ÄúFood for work‚Äù has proven to be effective foreign aid.

Tunisia has obvious security problems. Bourguiba has an enemy in Nasser and a possible opponent in Boumediene of Algeria. Together these countries command well over a half-billion dollars of Soviet arms, have five times the population and many times the natural resources of Tunisia. By contrast, Tunisia‚Äôs own military program is running at about $5 million a year.

We do not have an official commitment to come to Tunisia‚Äôs defense, but it would appear that we have one of the strongest moral commitments of any in this particular case. Fortunately, the presence of the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean gives us a capability which in most circumstances is more reassuring than agreements on paper.

There is a question about succession following Bourguiba. But there are a number of capable people available.

This is a country which has earned, and deserves, our full support. Bourguiba and Tunisia are real assets in the Middle East, in Africa, and in the ‚Äúthird world.‚Äù

Recommendations:

1.
Tunisia should remain one of the principal countries for the concentration of our economic assistance. Tunisia is nearing the take-off point economically and can be a shining example to others.
2.
Tunisia‚Äôs security is a valid concern for us, because of the location of the country and the stand its government has taken in vital world issues. Within our resource limits, there is no doubt that we have a commitment that should be honored. I believe that we should not cut our military aid below its present level, and should at the same time make our political support more clear. To strengthen Bourguiba is one way to weaken Nasser and Soviet influence. It also puts our prestige and power on the side of the constructive moderates in the Middle East.
3.
I was impressed by the way the Peace Corps and our private organizations and foundations have given a major new dimension to our assistance to Tunisia. This is a trend we should encourage.",,,,,,2020-01-13 13:35:42

He asked me about my opinion of doing studies in Germany as he‚Äôs also studying Germany lang. and he‚Äôs willing to make it to a good level.

What‚Äôs your opinion on Medicine or Network/Security as fields of studies?
I told him he should think of these two. He has no hobbies for Security nor IT stuff, and also no interest in Medicine... but I told him that if he wants to seek one of these, he needs to start taking interest in one these starting now.

Also, what‚Äôs your opinion on contacting universities in Germany using e-mails and other ways, would that be efficient for you to have a university that you contacted to study at after baccalaureate? Would that be efficient instead of having agencies in Tunisia that can handle this situation?

Also, is it good (by experience) to study abroad (Germany or anywhere) after baccalaureate? How does it cost? Wouldn‚Äôt be good to study in a Tunisian university then fly abroad (if you want)?

What are the fields of studies would you recommend for someone who‚Äôs really smart, and also someone who wants to make money without long years studies?

I studied English Literature and Civilization and graduated last year. Nedless to say it was the biggest mistake of my life. I can't seem to find a job, it's hard finding a job in the field of education w bikhlef teaching you really can't do anything.. no need to get into details but I feel like I fucked pretty hard and I wanna fix my life (your sis is tired of being unemployed).

Because I suck at pretty much everything except for English, and because I am really desperate for a job, the only thing that sounded reasonable for me to do is to study nursing (fil priv√©e ofc) and my questions are:

- Will I have to study mathematics, physics or chemistry as a nursing student? Cause I pretty much suck at those, like a lot. 


- Is it a good path, career ? 


- I hear that it's gory and disgusting cause you have to deal with a lot of shit, vomit, blood and grusome wounds. If so how bad is it? Is it something that everyone can adapt to? 


- What is the cheapest and best private nursing school in Tunisia that you can recommend?


- I heard from someone that ""Universit√© Mahmoud l Matri"" is the cheapest one. However, I am not pretty sure about its reputation and how recognized their degree is. I am asking this specifically because I might be moving to France in the future. If not is it possible that I study in ""Universit√© Mahmoud Matri"" two years then switch the third year to ""Universit√© Centrale"" to get my degree from there? 


- Can you work in public institutes if you're a graduate of a private school? Because I hear the pay isn't that good in private in compare to public ones (asking this just in case I didn't move to France lol)


Finally, I realize that I am asking a lot of questions. It's because I wanna be sure that this is the right thing for me to do, and so I don't have to study/struggle again, graduate then nou7el fil btala all over again.

I'm planning on spending about 3.5 days in Sousse and 2.5 in Tunis and was wondering if there are any attractions/sites I have missed that are worth seeing, or rather, some that can be skipped in place of others.

During my time in Sousse I'm planning on visiting:

- The Ribat/Medina of Sousse
- Sousse Archaeological Museum
- Bourghiba Mausoleum
- Ribat/Medina of Monastir
- El Jem

While in Tunis, I'm planning on visiting:

- The National Bardo Museum
- Bab El Bhar/The Ribat/Medina
- Carthage
- And I'm considering a trip to Dougga

My interests are history, nature, and architecture, so if a certain site isn't worth visiting given the short time I have, I'd be willing to visit elsewhere you guys recommend.

Thank you everyone for your help; and I look forward to visiting your beautiful country!",,,,,,2020-02-01 18:31:01

Lies, obtrusively lies.

They ( the majority of mentally challenged Tunisians) are responsible for political corruption since they elected and re-elected the same political figures and parties who doomed us for almost a decade. They will elect them again and again. The majority overcomes the minority regardless of the latter's rightfulness.

As for security, theft, physical assaults, sexual harassment; they have become normalized. The cops are responsible for that for they most definitely aren't doing their job whatsoever. I rarely see a police officer in a metro station ( AND I PASS BY DOZENS ON MY WAY TO UNIVERSITY). They are almost nonexistent. If you get robbed do not go to the police station, you will give the description and they say okay ""ma7dher"" and that crap, aka a waste of time ( if you go with a beard you will be investigated, speaking from personal experience)

""The Commons"", known as ""freret"", animalistic voices, putrid smell, inappropriate conduct ( breaking the bus windows, bullying passengers, pickpocketing). Not to mention that they have this common characteristic of glorifying""soccer teams"". They have no education. They do not do manual work. Most of them are illiterate. They thrive on the ""rojla and k\*\*ba mentality. They just steal.

Transportation is horrendous: metro, bus, taxi jaamai, you name it. Makes you feel as a subhuman.

Most of them public universities are falling behind the standards of a superior institute ( especially in humanities).

unemployment rates are rising. Not to mention the expensive prices of food and clothes, not to mention the lack of sexual freedom ( legally and socially). Not to mention the lack of religious freedom ( socially). Not to mention the prohibition of weed which can be at least allowed for medical uses.

Leave. I beseech you all to leave. I know it is not easy, but it is definitely worth the hardwork and time. It will not get better; it is already getting worse.

Put the nationalism optimistic mask off, you will feel like a comma in a book, like a brick in a house, like a glitch in a video game, like a fucking universal failure than nature benefits absolutely nothing from.

leave.  


Edit: For those opting for ""change the reality of our country instead of venting"", it is unchangeable. The hellish asylum, demonic hole we live in will always be the same. Needless of you to be morbid about it. I never said all Tunisians are bad; the majority of them are, however.   
Briefly, the time and effort you will invest on ""changing"" our much beloved glorified ""Tunisia"", which will inevitably undeniably prove trivial, invest it on yourself to live somewhere else. ",,,,,,2020-02-02 19:12:32

f1n514,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/f1n514/,2,Travel to South Tunisia- Local vs Online Prebook,"We are a group of four planning to fly from USA into Tunis but we also want to see Southern Tunisia, particularly the famous Star Wars locations like Matmata, Tatouine (Ksar Ouled Soltane), Chenini, etc. The prices I am seeing online for a guided tour to these locations seem ridiculously expensive. The lowest prices I am seeing are 700-800 dollars per person. This seems steep considering you can take a train down there and then a taxi if you wanted. My question is whether it is cheaper to book similar tours from local tour agencies on arriving. Would it be too last minute to do a booking while over there, especially when the locations aren't exactly sought out (Chenini for example)? Is it safe to book over there (personally I see no reason why not, but just asking)? Or is booking these private tours more recommended? I ask of course to save money but also because in my personal experience on a previous trip to an African safari, I found that hiring someone locally cost my group hundreds of dollars less for a similar or better experience. Sorry for the ramble, please advise if you can. Thank you all in advance!   


Side note/ question: We also would like to spend a day in Kairouan, but again, prebooking tours from online websites like Viator are charging 400 dollars for a simple day trip when taking a louage seems soooo much cheaper. If we did take a louage from Tunis to Kairouan, would it also be possible to take a louage back on the same night?

However, given that I wouldn't be able to tell if a spoken Arabic IS Tunisian with an untrained ear, and the fact that the writing usually doesn't give it away, I am hard pressed to find TV that is actually IN the Tunisian dialect, and my #1 fear with learning Arabic is watching a show I THOUGHT was Tunisian Arabic, but wasn't.

f2bnnl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/f2bnnl/,3,Travel advice ‚Äì getting from Le Kef to the desert?,"Hi all, I'm planning a trip to Tunisia for April, and it will be my first time in Africa. My plan is to spend 3 days in Tunis with day trips around the region (Carthage, Kourbous hot springs) and then go down to the desert. I want to make a stopover somewhere between those two spots, and had initially chosen Le Kef. The city sounds beautiful (I love hilly regions and was thinking of going to Dougga and Hammam Mellengue from there). 

But I haven't seen a lot of other travelers putting Le Kef on their itineraries, and I am not sure what the best method of getting to the desert towns, like Tozeur or Douz, is from there.  Since I'm traveling with a group of four people I would feel more comfortable having local confirmation that it would be easy to organize. I am the only French-speaker and will be organizing everything for the group (also people who have never been to Africa, though fairly seasoned travelers). Would picking a city on the eastern side of the country instead, which seems to have more frequent transport, including trains, be a better idea than Le Kef? 

FWIW, I don't mind off the beaten path destinations, and I'm most interested in history and culture. I'm not averse to bus or louage travel at all (have gone around Russia and the Balkans that way), just want to be sure it's available frequently enough. [Sntri.com.tn](https://Sntri.com.tn) doesn't seem to have any buses that go to the desert from Le Kef, for example...

Thing is, I have nothing to lose, the way my life is and like any other Tunisian , I have a lot of bottled up anger that needs to go somewhere. 

So, do I take things into my own hands and deal with the situation like a thug which may or may not result in prison time, or do I add this to all the bottled up things and just move on with my life like any other person who went through shit like this.

f4yj5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/f4yj5d/,11,"Following the Jasmine Revolution and First Libyan Civil War, how come Tunisia has enjoyed relative peace whilst Libya has descended into chaos?","I've recently changed my dissertation topic, it's now a comparative analysis on Tunisia and Libya post dictatorship titled Freedom &amp; The Failure of Democracy, looking at why Tunisia succeeded so to speak, and why Libya became arguably a failed state. My argument was gonna be that Tunisia is more urbanised and more literate but this is incorrect: Libya has substantially higher literacy rate, Libya is more urbanised, Libya's GDP in 2010 was nearly twice that of Tunisia's, unemployment was high but Tunisia's wasn't much lower, Libyans enjoyed decent benefits as far as I know, like $1000 or something to first time mothers and free housing, cheap fuel, so then I thought, maybe it is because Gadaffi was much more ruthless and oppressive than Zine, okay, well Gadaffi has been dead nearly a decade and Libya is now going into its 9th year of war. 

Does anybody else have any suggestions as to why two seemingly similar nations (so close they almost formed a single nation) turned out so differently under similar circumstances. The ones I can think of are the following but I don't know how true they are: 

Libyan society is more traditional/tribal and divided along ethnic/social lines, whereas in Tunisia, there is racism and regionalism, but for the most part the country is homogenous (however I found some sources disputing this, making Tunisia much more ethically diverse than Libya) 

Tunisia was colonised by France which despite its many many atrocities in North Africa, has had a lasting impact on Tunisian society and politics, and arguably one of the few benefits we got were the virtues and ideals of French liberalism and secularism. On the contrary, Libya was colonised by the Italians, who have a history of fascism, which offered little to the Libyan people and only divided them.  

Presence of arms in Libya meant something like this was inevitable, whereas firearm legislation in Tunisia is extremely strict, would have been very difficult for Tunisians to initiate an armed resistance. 

Size of Libya means it is much harder for a government to retain control and order. Tunisia is the little baby of North Africa and that allows the government in charge to mobilise very quickly. It would be like a war or something in the UK minus NI, there is barely anywhere to fight without mass casualties and the army can mobilise at a much faster rate, which brings me on to my next point.. 

The Libyan Army under Gadaffi had varying loyalties, whether that be to Gadaffi himself, the Libyan people or certain generals. Moreover, the Libyan people had and have varying loyalties, to Gadaffi, to rebels, to the East/West, to warlords, to their village. The Tunisian Army even under Ben Ali was very loyal to the people as it was made up of the people, the army ever turning on its people was extremely unlikely in the case of Tunisia. The Tunisian people seemed to be much more unified in their goal, which was to depose the dictator and instill democracy, Islamists and Seculars alike, protests remained pretty peaceful even when police used lethal force, bad stuff happened but it didn't last very long and didn't lead to a civil conflict. 

I would be very grateful if people could share their own ideas and opinions, I think it's an interesting discussion even if you just want to give your two millimes.",,,,,,2020-02-16 22:34:44

Tunisia is next to conflict areas, like the Libyan Civil War from the East, and also countries with strong militaries like Algeria from the West. It seems almost counter-intuitive. In the next 20-50 years, if a conflict comes to Tunisia or other countries try imposing their will on Tunisia, Tunisia will have no deterrent.

For comparison; Syria has over 200 MiG fighter jets, and Jordan has about 60 F-16s. Tunisia only has 11 F-5 light fighters.

Jordan has over 1,000 main battle tanks (MBTs), and Syria has over 4,000 MBTs. Tunisia again, only has a measly 200 MBTs.

It seems like Tunisia is not investing in their military, yet Tunisia is in a very politically turbulent area of the world. Would Tunisia be able to defend itself from events that happen in the next 20 or even 50 years, with such a small military?",,,,,,2020-02-21 06:32:13

To start, I know the first case of coronavirus was reported in Tunisia recently. We're still planning to go as we have nonrefundable flights and hotel and are healthy. 

1. Has there been any closures due to the virus? Museums, Carthage sites, El Jem amphitheater, restaurants, etc.?

2. How do Tunisians feel about Americans right now? 

3. Do you have any advice on staying safe? This is a short trip, so just Tunis, El Jem and hopefully a day trip to Dougga.

4. Any advice on how to do a day trip to Dougga from Tunis and how much that might cost? Hard to find information online.

5. Restaurant recommendations in Tunis for amazing Tunisian food?

Here it is, I rent a studio for a short period of 2 months in Tunis, and I have to leave soon, the owner gmask me a  of 400dt to repaint the bedroom and the living room, the walls are not disgusting but I  admit that there are some fingerprints that are even more visible than the rest of the wall is white.
  I do not know the current rates, is it a good price?  Do I have to call painters myself?  
How long will it take to complete the work?

  Any help will be welcome thanks in advance.

Turkey has supported Hayat Tahrir Al Sham, which is a part of Al Qaeda in Syria. Turkish regular troops are seen with terrorists like ISIS and Al Qaeda on a daily basis in Syria. All of this is a well known public fact and it is out in the open, I don't even need to post sources, because this was openly discussed and exposed by the UN. Turkey has also supported ISIS in Libya, and has brought thousands of terrorists from Syria into Libya.

&amp;#x200B;

So what's with Tunisia buying Turkish drones, and supporting the Turkish economy, while Turkey bombs fellow Arabs and Berbers on a daily basis in Syria and Libya? Does Tunisia have anymore dignity left?

&amp;#x200B;

And what's with the Tunisian government accepting terrorist groups to operate on it's soil?  Ahrar Al-Sharqia is one of the most brutal terrorist groups in Syria, which have participated in mass rapes, genocide, theft, terrorism, and other various crimes. Yet, they are allowed to operate openly in Tunisia? If I'm a criminal, can I also go and live in Tunisia?

Some Tunisians consider themselves Arab. 
Some Tunisians consider themselves Amazigh.
Some Tunisians consider themselves Turk/European/Jewish 
Some Tunisians consider themselves Black 
Some Tunisians just consider themselves Tunisian 

Tunisia is a multiethnic state and our culture is literally the result of our country being the melting pot of the 'old world'. It's at a crossroads between Europe, Africa and Asia, of course we are going to be a product of those three continents. 

We are all Tunisian, we are all African, we are all Mediterranean and we are all Maghrebi. If you aren't Tunisian, don't assume we are Arab, if you are Tunisian, don't assume we all identify as Imazighen. 

Factually, yes, the average Tunisians genetics is majority Berber but with genes from the Middle East, Turkey, Iberia/Southern Europe, West Africa and even Scandinavia. Around 15-20% of Tunisians are Afro-Berber/Afro-Arab, and around 4-5% of Tunisians are the descendants of Janissaries, there is also a substantial Russian genetic influence in Bizerte I believe (but don't quote me on that, the facts and figures are sketchy), and around 4/5% of Tunisians (domestically and internationally) are of dual parentage. We also have an increasing number of West African brothers and sisters calling Tunisia home, and I for one would rather celebrate our diversity than argue with a stranger on the internet about what we are or what we aren't.",,,,,,2020-03-14 20:31:40

Problem : some of you , Tunisian redditors ,may notice that some greedy people bought an enormous quantity of flour, pasta and basic food supplies, causing by doing that , a food recession in all the markets.. so, you may find others without food.

Solution:
In the period of WWII, Americans have already figured out this problem by using the procedure of rationing.
This method is sufficient to have an equal distribution of all the supplies. This method says that each citizen has a logical amount of food supplies in a well-known period of time.however , he's not allowed to buy a quantity of food that surpass the legal amount. And you have a ration book that mention all the transactions.

I think, this is a solution to stop the Monopoly of food supplies.",,,,,,2020-03-15 19:10:14

The truth is  we won't be able to get a vaccine for this in 2020 no matter what tests need to be done a lot of research which absolutely gonna take time and this what Drs around the world are saying.

foigdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/foigdb/,2,Address this stereotype: Are Tunisians lazy?,"Especially among Tunisians living abroad, there is a sense that Tunisians, and especially the younger generation, are lazy freeloaders. Please tell me why in your this is or is not true.

To give you my background and where this question is coming from, I am born and raised in the US and I only visit Tunisia almost every summer, so my understanding of the culture is pretty limited (which is why communities like these are really important to me). I also have family who lives in Europe who visits Tunisia with me at the same time. Everytime we go, I have a few family members who get very frustrated with the inefficiencies of the system and when they get particularly frustrated, theyll let out their anger and start an argument with a waiter who is not always available or a store clerk or something like that. So there is this attitude, especially among Tunisians living abroad, that Tunisia is a lazy country.

Please share your thoughts with me. Thank you!

I know this is a test from the mighty god.Also , I believe now that the power of nations, can't be evaluated by comparing their technology , their millitary, their businesses or their political charismas. It is evaluated by  the mindset of their people, their solidarity and the purpose of a nation.Now, Look at Cuba who sent its doctors to support Italian short-handed hospitals.

It's almost been a month since the first coronavirus case was reported and we've only tested 3000 people with over 300 positive cases. If that's not a holy shit number idk what is.

All the coverages, articles, bickering and yelling on TV will not amount to anything if you don't know the real numbers. What's even sadder, all these public figures and people who should know better are using the number of cases as a coping mechanism to misinform people and trivialize the situation, ""It's only 200 cases, let's hope it stays that way"".

I'm not trying to take away from the good things we've done so far, I think we're one of the few countries that acted accordingly and strictly 'somewhat' early on. The testing, however, is beyond lacking and it's really worrying.

I recently fell for this online blackmailer from Sousse, Tunisia. Was a girl trying to video chat me but she had some guy recording my video. Long story short, a sensitive video of me was captured. They are threatening to share it with family and friends through Facebook and YouTube. 

I want your help contacting local police in Tunisia. I have their phone number, name, picture, and other details. Any help would be appreciated.


**Edit:** I'm living outside Tunisia. 

**Edit 2:** Most of this took place on Facebook messenger. Then transitioned to WhatsApp

**Edit 3:** They shared with me a list of some friends/family. I think they captured it from my Facebook after we connected.

**Edit 4:** here's what I have.
Her Facebook name, and profile picture.

Chat log on Facebook and WhatsApp.

Their WhatsApp number (a business number)

Also, I captured the YouTube video URL when they sent me a photo of it bring uploaded. Thing is, when I try to access it, says the video is not available. Now, idk if this is because it was taken down (I pray) OR, because the URL changes after it's full done uploading. They sent another one showing it fully uploaded but no URL was visible.

Our parents are probably teachers, nurses, police officers, accounting clerks and small business owners. They are mostly employees who get a monthly salary and has managed in the previous years to save a small amount of funds, which combined with their regular earnings, has helped greatly in this pandemic.   


However, the citizens clustering around the post offices, who have been called uncivilized and stupid by many Facebook users, are, or rather used to be poor dayworkers. They are peddlers, baristas, and some have been  jobless for years. With the curfew, they have no income. The ones with the white card are supposed to get 50 DT and those with the yellow card  200 DT. A modest allowance through which they can at least purchase food and medicament. Without such allowance they would literally go hungry. Therefore, it is no surprise to see them so desperate and hasty to hold on the spark of life rather than falling into a cavernous abyss of famine and poverty.   


It is the government to put the blame on. The distribution of allotments is unorganized . The post offices are small, and cannot take tens of people at once, especially in counties. The entire matter should have been a door-to-door procedure, or at least the recipients should have been invited separately to other governmental buildings to get the grants.   
The situation in Tunisia is getting more and more alarming, but people are rebuking the victims rather than the assailants. The  needy who went outside to get the money are pretty aware of the current serious circumstances, and yet here they are risking their lives to fill their stomachs, while an unneedy boorish snob affronting them for doing what they have been compelled to do instead of affronting the compellers .",,,,,,2020-04-05 12:29:30

I am a dual national looking to purchase property in Tunisia, obviously one of my nationalities is Tunisian. I have never permanently resided in Tunisia but I have the right to as far as I know, because I hold a Tunisian passport. 

I plan to leave Europe and begin investing in Tunisia after the pandemic is over, but I don't really understand how the process would work. I was hoping some locals would be able to help me. 

I've found a few apartments I like, mainly in Ariana and some in Sehoul, Sousse, the prices almost seem too good to be true when I convert into GBP so I just had a few questions. 

I can speak enough Tounsi to get by, but I can't read or write Arabic and I wouldn't be able to use it in a professional or academic manner, so would there be lawyers offering an English language service?

I have never had a Tunisian bank account so I have no credit history there, would they be likely to give me a loan (probably around 200,000DT) without a credit file in Tunisia?",,,,,,2020-04-08 17:16:15

I am a student from the Netherlands, currently writing my bachelor's thesis on the Dignity Revolution. I want to avoid only looking at what Western historians say about the Revolution and have therefore tried as much as possible to speak to Tunisians about it as well. I have interviewed a very kind employee of your embassy in the Netherlands and tried to reach out to others as well but the university councils, professors and embassies that I emailed did not reply. I therefore wanted to ask if anyone who was involved in the Revolution would be willing to answer some of my questions (this means I might also need some personal information, since I have to prove to my professors that the interviews are legitimate) or if anyone would be able to put me into contact with organisations like student unions, human rights organisations, labour unions, etc.

Thank you in advance!",,,,,,2020-04-13 14:28:23

g3wkiu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/g3wkiu/,20,Why can't we attract video game companies?,"A large portion and I even dare to say that most of the population here is a Gamer since childhood, many video games like Call of Duty 2 were set in Tunisia and some even have important characters and not just minor, plenty of people here are ready to spend hundreds of Dinars to play video games and we have many professional players and teams in many games like League of Legends, Counter Strike, Call of Duty, Battlefield, World of Warcraft etc..., we even have our local game industry (even though it's just a few people who made few and not good games) and the list goes on and on which shows that Tunisia is a very Gamer country even though our government is neglecting this sector like video games don't exist (which is why we shouldn't vote for old people who weren't even born after the independence).

And yet, despite all that no well known game company ever came to Tunisia even in 2020, no subsidiary, no studio, simply nothing.

What makes it even more bad situation is that when you try to create accounts in services like PSN you can't find Tunisia in the list and thus you have to pretend like you're from another country, not to mention that the vast majority of the online stores don't accept our currency and no store would make a special price for us like how Steam does and therefore you would have to pay the same expensive price of the US where Americans there earn money more than Tunisians here and on top of all that, there is no single physical copy game ever released in Tunisia and not even game consoles, everything we have here is brought by normal people (in both legal and illegal ways) to sell it in a very very expensive price, like PS5 is going to be around a thousand Dinar and half in the US when it's going to be released and the price of a PS4 here is most of the time thousands and more.

And if that's the case, then forget about gift cards, bonuses, special Editions and releasing a game for our country only.

And yet, in other Arab countries like us like Egypt and the Gulf countries have well known and great video game companies like Ubisoft and made fantastic games, they even have their own companies that also made their own popular and fantastic titles.

So why's our country that bad, why can't we do something to attract video game companies and even make our own game companies and studios and compete with others?",,,,,,2020-04-18 22:38:17

g47rd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/g47rd2/,4,To what extent was the revolution responsible for religious extremism amongst Tunisians,"I'm doing a report on how the revolution disenfranchised Tunisian youth making them vulnerable to indoctrination and extremist ideologies, and would appreciate any opinions and ideas you may have. 

Do you think the extremism was there before the revolution and Islamists merely used the instability to capitalise? 

Do you think young people were frustrated at the lack of opportunity following democratisation? 

Did people see the revolution and ultimately, democracy as a failure and thus possibly saw extremist ideology as the final recourse? 

I'm really curious to see why you think so many Tunisians flocked to various foreign civil wars, and why terrorist attacks involving Tunisians at home and in Europe spiked following the revolution. From my research it seems the only notable attack from 2000 until 2013, was the Ghriba synagogue attack, however since the deposition of Ben Ali, there have been countless attacks.

I'm also curious as to why most attacks in Tunisia are particularly discriminate, they either target officials, security forces or tourists, seldom have the attacks targeted Tunisian civillians, why is that? 

Also, what do you think is the solution to the problem of extremism amongst young Tunisians, improved economic opportunities? Tighter security?

Is extremism in Tunisia endemic to specific regions? From my research thus far it seems like a significant amount of perpetrators come from poor suburbs of Tunis, as well as the Kasserine and Jendouba regions, which as far as I know are marred by poverty and inequality. 

Of the large number of Tunisians who went abroad to fight, why do you think this happened, why did Tunisians specifically contribute such a significant number of young fighters, particularly given our countries relatively secular history.

I am currently a French-Tunisian student studying in Paris (it's my first year) and since Macron's speech, I learned that college students won't be going back to uni until next year and here I am confined till summer.

I used to live in Tunisia before I moved to continue my studies and all my family lives there except my sister who is my roommate. The confinement really makes me miss home and the only people I wanna be around are my family. I wanna go back to Tunisia, I don't want to stay here until the airports reopen (which will probably be around mid-July).

So here I am looking for repatriation flights from Paris to Tunisia, do you think I can take one ? I am not exactly a resident of Tunisia since it's only my family that lives in there, on my ID it's written that I live in France but I technically have a home in Tunis. Do you think I can go back to my country ?",,,,,,2020-04-21 16:33:20

Before I go into it, i want to wish you all are doing well since we're living in harsh tense times now due to the COVID-19. Stay home, stay safe. Frankly, it's only for the good or great.   


Allow me to start by giving you a brief tweak about the situation.   
It's my first year here in Tunisia, ""as a Tunisian"", and i gotta say even though much won't agree that people in my country our country are so convivial. So i'm a student, first year in university, that speaks four languages and is just in love with many disciplines, mostly business and precisely stock trading.  


I have searched for many ways where i can be, in a way or another, financially independent. Thus, made a lot of researches since my arrival here in Tunisia on the most heated markets, on part time jobs, on ""bourse Tunisie"", on some small businesses that can generate passive income ; frankly it was a struggle. Nothing seemed neat, legitimate, worth the time and jobs didn't have that feel close to the""teen job thing Americans do"". In addition of that, looked for some banks that lend study loans but figured that such thing doesn't exist here.

All in all, i wanted information from the people to the people, and what's better than asking those 5k potential Tunisians about ideas and advice and how they made themselves financially free or made enough money to later pursue their dreams. 

PS: I tried not making this so long, and sorry if it is. I want it to be seen by the most to get enough feedback.

gaok5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/gaok5d/,1,Tunisian married couples should not conceive children if they are financially unable to raise them,"The husband works and the wife remains at home indulging herself in housekeeping: dusting, mopping, cleaning the dishes and preparing meals all day long. Technically speaking, she is an unpaid housekeeper. The husband leaves early and comes late to his humble residence, suffering from work fatigue and frustrated by the traffic jam. Naturally, he does not own a car; he has never owned a car and will never be able to afford one with his inconsistent, modest payment. He takes the metro. The metro is always crowded, vociferous and filled with stink when he finishes work. Nothing unusual for he got used to the jam, clamor and stench. He arrives to his cramped apartment. The thin walls are cracking and every time it rains water leaks and floods the floor. His two-room lodging is very small and barren, yet he cherishes it. After all, the rent costs half of his monthly earning. The wife has prepared pottage for dinner, third time this week. Peasant food is still better than nothing  since they had nights when they slept with an empty stomach. The husband is a poor dayworker; he can be a peddler, a barista, a logger... It does not matter which one he is, he still works days and goes jobless for many others, receiving almost a moneyless tribute for his services, and frequently being obliged to borrow money from a friend or a family member, with the lenders more frequently becoming philanthropists out of sympathy. Ultimately, that who barely owns cannot give back.   


These are the Tunisian married couples I am addressing: THE VERY POOR ONES. Those who can hardly make it through the day, let alone if they had children. Your child deserves to live in a proper, comfy house where he/she feels warm and vivid instead of a falling crowded building with fluffy walls where he has no privacy whatsoever and hear the fighting of the neighbors day and night,to eat healthy food and grow strong, to wear good clothes ( I am not talking about luxurious attire), to have access to the internet and own a smartphone or a PC so he can both study and have fun, to go on a vacation once a year and enjoy himself, to own a bicycle and indulge in what seems to him as the greatest adventure, to read books and nourishes his mind, to go to university, even to go to a private university and follows his dreams if he succeeds at the baccalaureate exam with a low grade. These are the minimal necessities, and a family with one irregular poor income cannot provide them.   


I bet we have all seen beggars holding their children, using them as an incentive to stimulate the hearts of the passengers so they would give them money. Your child is not a tool to use like that. Moreover, your child is not an income having him drop out of school and sent to a workshop to assist a mechanician or shipped to a farm like a serf. Sadly, child labour is common in our country, and those who deprive their children of their childhood are the worst parents. Not to forget they also do not have health insurance.

Some of you might say there are people coming from a similar familial background who became successful in life. Well, here's the brutal truth: those who succeed are extremely rare, exceptions. The great majority grew sick, hungry, illiterate, homeless, some of them criminals, others, with no education, no career, are leading a miserable life.

I know there are a lot of tunisian movies/series that come out every year but although many of them (movies) have received awards, they are actually pretty boring or bad. Out of the 4 tunisians movies I watched in my entire life, only one turned out good. As for the series, well, besides Nouba and Choufli Hal, I'd say there's not much good to watch either. But then again, my cinematic culture is pretty small sooo... Anyway, I'm looking about something typically tunisian, something about tunisian daily life. Bonus points if it is set in the 60's or talk about gangster life or maybe both! Let's be crazy! But at this point, any period of time and subject will do (unless sitcoms).

gf7txg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/gf7txg/,13,Questions about the military.,"Hello, tunisian here. 18 y.o and will be taking my Baccalaureate exam this year ( hopefully, if nothing happens due to the pandemic ). I'm a good student overall and hopefully I'll get good results.

After that, I don't think I can do any job other than the military. I don't like anything else, and I've always enjoyed the physical work, + the idea of that kind of discipline and team work is very appealing to me. So I have a couple of questions regarding this subject :

1- What is the best branch ( military, paramilitary, anything.. ), and specifically which ones that offer the best opportunity if you have good grades?

2- I've been mostly thinking about joining the aviation academy, but I don't see much information online about the qualifications needed , it's mostly general information that everyone knows. So, can anyone add any info about this ? Whether it's from personal experience or other people's experiences. I wanna know stuff like medical requirements, grades, how many years do you have to study until you can actually fly, and can you join directly just after this exam, without first joining a civilian prep school.

I've been a bit hesitant about becoming a pilot because we're not like the US, we don't have that big of a military force, according to wikipedia, we have only 157 planes in total ( including training planes). As I can see from a couple yt videos, there are a lot of pilots and many old ones and we don't seem to be in shortage, so what are the hundreds of yearly graduates going to fly ? Hence, it must be EXTREMELY hard to become a pilot.

3- How hard is the training ? Obviously it's hard since it's the military, but is it navy seals hard? It would be great is anyone could share his experience.

EDIT : 4- How do I apply to any of the branches ? Do I have to wait until I see something online about a recruitement, or can I join at any time ?",,,,,,2020-05-07 14:44:20

I made a previous post asking about the military, especially about becoming a pilot but I don't want to stay focused on one path, I like to have options.

I've searched online for days and days for any information about it, but I found absolutely nothing. I don't know what kind of requirements they demand. I'm physically fit and mentally pretty strong, I've had good grades all my life and hopefully after a couple months I'll be taking my baccalaureate exam.

But I don't know if what I have is enough, since I don't know anything about the subject. I don't know what kind of result they expect from the baccalaureate exam, I don't know if I have to get in a prep school first or I can directly join them for training, or if I must start like in the ordinary infantry and make my way to the top even though I have good grades. I don't even how can I join, whether I have to search online until I find something about recruitement or if I can go somewhere anytime and join for training.

It would be great if anyone could share some light on this because I'm sure a lot of young people like e aspire to become something like this but can't find anything online.",,,,,,2020-05-07 19:21:06

I see that you can launch an e-business for such small amounts of money, but the business field in Tunisia is mostly done in ""physical shops"" which makes it expensive to create something because you'll be obliged to rent a place etc...

Let's say a Tunisian is a digital nomad and can give the Tunisian customs a sheet of paper saying he is a resident of Burkina Faso... what else would he need? Tax return forms? Registration at the embassy in that country?
* If a foreigner has been in Tunisia as a ""tourist"" for a long time and now wants to get residency, how can he benefit from the FCR import of a car? Can he apply for a carte de sejour then get permission to import a car without paying taxes or must he get this permission before getting a carte de sejour?
* Is it a complete excemption of import duties on a car, or a duty of 25%, or 25% of what a Tunisian would pay, so if the car gets taxed at 333%, he would have to pay just 83.25% of the price of the car?
* Can I bring a Right Hand Drive car from Japan (for use in the UK/Malta) or do cars entering Tunisia for registration have to be European or US spec?

Also, with the chaotic driving and traffic, it wouldn't be safe for motorcyclists to drive without a sense of danger around them and personally i don't want to spend my money on something that would bring me anxiety more than fun knowing that getting on a motorcycle really takes a lot of weight of my shoulders and give me that sense of freedom and peace of mind.

Finally, i would say the title is a bit cheeky but it's intent was to bring you people to talk about this topic and give feed-back and tell STORIES (for example: scary scenarios you saw or experienced) even on whether someone passionate about motorcycles should let go of his hobby for ""reasons"" or pursue it and deal with reality.

Road rules (and whether they are followed)

If you haven‚Äôt ever driven in a non-Western country before, driving in Tunisia will be an interesting experience. Drivers take the view that road rules, traffic signs, and traffic signals are interesting things that bear very little relation to actually driving.

Local drivers tend to ignore all regulations, even when police are clearly visible. They don‚Äòt seem to care about which side of the road they drive on half the time.

Pedestrians have right of way, which drivers generally ignore. Don‚Äôt expect drivers to stop at pedestrian crossings or stop lights. Consequently, pedestrians take license to wander into traffic without giving much indication that they‚Äòre about to do so. Pedestrians also frequently run between traffic, even on major highways.

People who ride bicycles, motorcycles, and motor scooters will regularly weave through traffic, attempting to squeeze through incredibly narrow spaces at high speeds. It doesn‚Äôt help that few of these vehicles have adequate lights or reflectors, making them difficult to see even if they weren‚Äôt driving so erratically.

Tunisia has a high number of police and military checkpoints, and if you come across one of these, be sensible and approach slowly. Speeding towards a checkpoint is a good way to make several men with automatic weapons very nervous indeed. Checkpoint authorities tend to be polite to foreign travelers, but you must be ready to present photo ID upon request, and they may detain you if you don‚Äòt have it, particularly if you are near one of the more troubled border regions. Tourists must carry ID with them at all times.

Is this true?",,,,,,2020-05-27 10:52:14

Je regarde les films et j‚Äôai eu une id√©e.
J‚Äôai commenc√© √† r√©diger et la d√©velopper mais comment on fait un sc√©nario d‚Äôun long m√©trage? J‚Äôai trouv√© plusieurs r√©ponses sur internet. 
Est ce que vous avez des conseils ou bien des exemples de sc√©nario pr√©f√©rences film Tunisien pour long/ court m√©trage?

guplcn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/guplcn/,2,Thoughts about Souti App,"Hello everyone,

About a month ago I launched the App that enables to evaluate politicians in Tunisia ([Android Version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.techintellig.souti)) many of you was supportive. When the app got bigger and received many installations and interactions, there was some issues that floated around:

1. People think it's Facebook, you can find many comments without any real added information or value, that kind of pics you find on facebook.
2. ¬†¬†It's hard to prevent flock effect, one day you find all ***Nahdha*** members are on top 20, the next day you find ***Mouvement de peuple*** members on top 20. (those are just examples).
3. The most important thing, the content of the application is not dynamic. For example I open the app, downvote this and upvote that, writ some demands, etc.. That's it, There is no new content that makes me go back to the app, there is no debates for example, polls...

The app now has almost 2k installations, and challenges now are bigger, I want just to share thoughts with you and listen to your suggestions.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all.",,,,,,2020-06-01 18:08:39

gzpf6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/gzpf6g/,3,For or against reforming private universities? Why? How?,"In one hand:

* Private unis have become a way, for too many students, to have a decent degree and start a decent career (even go abroad).
* Private unis have more budget thus better teaching quality (presumably).  
More budget also means better monitoring for students, better facilities, better surrounding and activities.
* Public unis have proven their potential before the revolution and the rise of private schools.  
You may like it or not, public unis are historical institutions, that have made strong figures in this country.  


In the other hand:

* Private unis are too expensive, and start to weight too much on the jo market, making people who can't afford studying there more prone to unemployment/being underpaid/seen as not good enough for the job.
* Private unis separate youth in two distinct groups: the ones that can afford, and those who can't (see serious long term societal problems).
* Another related point is: private school grads are more prone to GTFO the country, and go to Europe only to come back rich enough, buy houses and dodge taxes. (e.g. I've never seen a public grad go to Europe as easily as an ESPRIT grad).
* Sadly enough, teachers that went from public to private must have had valid reasons to do it ($$$).
* Budgets given to public unis might be too low (I speculate, I don't know). But it seems like besides med, architecture, some human sciences unis and pr√©pas/engineering, all the other unis are worth nothing (people graduating there are not very welcomed in the job market), the programs/teachers are too dull and empty, it seems depressing for student (seems like anything but the image that we must have of a university).
* Some teachers give lectures in a private school and a public school at the same time. Do they dedicate themselves equally with that huge difference in pay?  


What do you think about it?  


Is taxing private schools a solution to dissuade founding more of them?  
Is founding more of them a better solution?  
Banning private schools?  
Giving more budget to public unis?  
Forbidding teachers to give lessons in both simultaneously?",,,,,,2020-06-09 15:34:00

h7vn6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/h7vn6n/,10,What do you think are the dominant cultural/ethnic and linguistic influences on modern Tunisians,"I am conducting a study on the Tunisian identity, see my last post to participate in a short quiz re that. I'm currently reviewing the literature regarding historical assimilation in Tunisia, and my main findings so far are the following: 

Linguistic: Mainly Arabic, significant Berber, notable Latin, French, Italian and Spanish influence. 

Culture: Largely Arab, significant Berber influences varying by region and factors such as urban/rural location, most notable in music, cuisine, and traditional garb. Also French and Italian, Turkish. 

Religion: Whilst predominantly Sunni Muslim, Tunisia like much of North and West Africa, overwhelmingly subscribes to the Maliki school of thought, in contrast to the majority of Middle Eastern nations which are Hanafi, Hanbali, Ibadi. 

Genealogy: Mainly Berber, in fact, the most recent data seems to suggest that the majority of Tunisians are overwhelmingly Berber, with the Eastern Arab component ranging from 4% to 20%. With the exception of Kairouan which has a much higher Arab genetic influence, the highest figure I've seen for North Africa specific genealogy in Tunisians is 88% (although it's important to note this figure doesn't necessarily indicate pure Berber ancestry). 

To add, the most notable outside influences on Tunisian genealogy appear to come from Spain (Morisco), the Levant and Arabia

Well those are my findings so far, please do take the survey if you get a chance, I can post the link again if you like, and please share your own opinions, ideas and knowledge, as I am interested to hear what areas I have perhaps not touched up on enough, and any ideas or theories I've missed entirely.

Also I should add, I'm not trying to prove Tunisians aren't Arab and are Berber or vice versa, the study is merely defining what it means to be Arab and questioning the extent to which contemporary Tunisia CAN be considered an Arab nation.",,,,,,2020-06-12 23:23:52

h8h3b6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/h8h3b6/,7,Is poverty the only motive to do crime ( Robbery or Braquage) ? are there other motives?,"In those recent years,  the phenomena of BRAQUAGE has propagated in  all over Tunisia, young people of age between 15 and 30 don't fear anything or anyone and target people individually to steal their personal assets (phones , money,watches ,etc...)there are even some known places that witness more possible actions of theft (I don't like to mention places, so that some people won't be offended).

what I would like to know if there are some more crucial motives that can lead directly or indirectly to such acts of stealing. I know that poverty and crime are strongly correlated,  but I want to hear some of your opinions regarding this matter.

Maybe someone won't agree with the fact (of poverty and crime are strongly correlated) and will say that there are some example of poor families who didn't engage in such behavior and worked really hard to get out from poverty and claims that being poor isn't a clear excuse to justify robbery.

Other thing, I believe that Tunisian people begin to normalize the phenomena of BRAQUAGE, and deal with it like a normal behavior. it slowly becomes the new normal! for example, if you are a victim of a BRAQUAGE, and then head to the police station to make a complaint, they will tell you that they don't have time for you and that they deal with more serious cases than your case, they deal with it like it is a sting of an ant. it's not even the police, even your family will try to distract you and will tell you to forget about it.

to conclude, I think we need to figure out this problem and reach out the optimal solutions.",,,,,,2020-06-13 22:12:07

heh1mq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/heh1mq/,5,This is an Islamophobic subreddit (Read before judging),"Long time lurker and I guess it's time to give my honest opinion about this subreddit and why I concluded it to be a place for Islamophobia

Now, many people have a problem with the term but we cannot deny that it exists and it's useless to argue about the term but here is what I mean exactly, a bigot and ignorant person who has nothing to do in life but to involve Islam in everything he sees, he saw a person pissing under a tree he blames it on Islam, he won't research about anything, he won't try to see if what he says is wrong or not and he doesn't say his words in a nice, respectful way and his mind is totally filled with hate against Muslims and Islam.

And I saw that this subreddit is filled with this kind of people, a prime example is this :  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/he3m17/a\_postive\_post/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/he3m17/a_postive_post/)

This is something that happens again and again, a post about something that has nothing to do with religion until a person comments how much he hates Islam and I realize that I'm not the only person to complain about this but that's I posted this, to remind everyone about this problem but also as a message to these people

You hate Islam and Muslims and anything that has to do with them ? fine but don't ruin every post with your nonsense, it's so annoying when you are having a good day and suddenly you see an ugly comment that ruins it all

I thought this subreddit is for all Tunisians whether they are Muslim or not but I guess that's not the case, this is truly annoying not because I'm Muslim (shocking) but it's annoying even if I were a Christian or even an atheist and this is not something good especially for a young subreddit like this one, when you antagonize anyone you don't like

But it would be nice if the owner of this subreddit makes it clear that this kind of hatred is not acceptable (it doesn't mean that you have to delete comments or posts, just say that we shouldn't hate each other for example) but i doubt it that it will happen since I saw some mods even agreeing to some of Islamophobic claims.

Best wishes to everyone here and Adios.",,,,,,2020-06-23 15:49:24

- Many people can work as freelancers and won't stay jobless.
- you can argue that this will hurt our currency, so to combat this problem we can limit unnecessary imports and taxe them evenly ( I know some people that pay bribes to avoid taxes)
- we are far behind other countries that implemented PayPal ages ago. Morocco for example didn't suffer economically from this and it's having a steady growth.

How to end them ?,"I realized my uncle (who's a lawyer) just opened HIS FIRST EMAIL ACCOUNT EVER at age 53...so I can send him some files...So I asked him how did you manage to survive all the paper work for so long ??

He replied : I don't. I have a secretary taking care of that. I barely know how to use a computer.

Literally every task his secretary performs (he handles phone calls himself) could be automatized by cheap programs and a minimum of tech savyness (excel, words et al).

It says a lot. A sh\*t tons of jobs in Tunisia (and developing) countries are completely useless, belong to  the 20th century and could totally be replaced by a minimum of IT investment. Tunis Air is said to have three times more employees that she actually needs. Bureaucratic jobs where people just sit there and stare at their computers not performing any work whatsoever are blooming, making every process X times longer and difficult. 

Last  time I met a ""financial analyst"" working for the Tunisian version of Leboncoin...they have 50 employees and they are useless (it's a user generated content app, and all the software is made in HQ in Spain). Financial Analyst ? What she needs to ""Analyze"" ?

Sooo many jobs which can be already be replaced here... and Tunisia is not the only culprit. Every country in the world have jobs that can already be automated (all jobs in French administration and faculties) 

Don't you agree that the laziness of people from the ancient times is what preventing the world becoming faster, smoother and more connected ? 

Do you believe in Universal Income ? 

Don't you think that, with the level of education of Tunisians, it might be possible to establish a true functional society of leisure based on an economy of sharing, with only meaningful, productive and useful activity with a minimum of boring/difficult work ?

""Average  heterozygosity of the North African populations is high relative to our  global samples, consistent with a complex demographic history. The  Tunisian and Libyan samples form a discrete cluster in the global and  regional views and can be separated from sub‚ÄêSahara, Middle East, and  Europe. Within Tunisia the Nebeur and Smar are outlier groups. Across  North Africa, pervasive East‚ÄêWest geographical patterns were not found.

Known  historical migrations and invasions did not displace or homogenize the  genetic variation in the region but rather enriched it. Even a small  region like Tunisia contains considerable genetic diversity. Future  studies across North Africa have the potential to increase our  understanding of the historical demographic factors influencing the  region.

""During  successive historical periods, Tunisia has been a crossroads of  multiple civilizations and their corresponding key population movements.  The aim of this study was to provide genetic information relating to  the mixed origin of the Tunisian population, and to analyze its genetic  relationship with other North African and Mediterranean populations. A  set of 16 *Alu* and 3 *Alu*/STR compound systems has been  analyzed in 268 autochthonous Tunisians from the north-center and the  south of the country. Our two sampled populations showed no significant  differentiation from one another in any of the three *Alu*/STR compound systems, whereas the analysis of the 16 *Alu* markers revealed a significant genetic differentiation between them. A sub-Saharan component shown by the three *Alu*/STR combinations is more noticeable in our north-center sample than in that of the south. The presence of two *Alu*/STR  combinations specific to North African ancestral populations also  suggests that the ancient Berber component is relatively more  substantial in the north and center regions than in the south. Our  Tunisian samples cluster together with other Berber samples from Morocco  and Algeria, underpinning the genetic similarity among North Africans  regardless of their current linguistic status (Berber or Arabic)""

"" The  close genetic relationship of the two Arab-speaking populations with  the Berber-speaking samples could be explained assuming a small number of Arabs coming from the Arabian Peninsula, as compared with that of the  autochthonous Berbers, resulting in a weak Arab genetic influence in  the current mixed North Africans.

And what he/she did to you ?,"I have all my respect for the good teachers out there in Tunisia that support and treat their students fairly BUT I heard/seen/experienced so much bullshit from teachers in Tunisia before and after the revolution (especially in elementary school where children are most vulnerable) let's start from bad to worst :

_ I had a teacher who picks his nose and dead ass throw the boogers at his students (he was also kinda insane like mumbling to himself)

_ some of our elementary school teacher used to send kids to do various chores like buying her food in the MIDDLE of the session where she send kids cross the fucking streets and in the middle of the class she invites her friend for a feast where the time they spend eating supposed to be for learning (Btw we watch them eat while all of our stomachs grumble u know because we were kids)

_ *my experience* I once did a stupid ""decorate a spoon project"" , my naive ass didn't want it to be ruined so I decided not to put it in my bag so I ended up forgetting it, so when I told the teacher she beat the shit out of me like punches and strong slaps (she had huge thick hands) for a fucking spoon , didn't tell my mom because I was stupid.

_ *my cousin experience* in middle school, f class technique a teacher accused her of making noises with her pen (she wasn't, the friend behind her was) she denied,  so he got mad w kharajha exclus , she picked her bag and slammed the door after her , she got expelled for 10 days ( at that time her mother was sick she got more sick thinking her daughter was a naughty girl)

_ *in the media* the students from elementary to high school gets sexually harassed even r*ped by teachers but even with so many cases everytime l ŸÜŸÇÿßÿ®ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿßÿ≥ÿßÿ™ÿ∞ÿ© stands with the teacher so aggressively saying :„Äähe/she is an old experienced person you should respect them , he/she can never do this , the kid is lying and blah blah„Äãwithout even considering listen to the victims and giving them a chance so justice is never served 

_ discipline in Tunisia is not even slap on the wrist type,  its I break your bones type , I've heard many MANY stories from close people where their classmates got their bones broken by a teacher

_ f bac ki mata9rach aand prof √©tude eli i9ari fik f classe they will ruin your BAC with it your self esteem its happens even to this day not only before the revolution.



   I'm not trying say that all teachers are bad I've had supportive teachers who cares but the bad apples are so many and usually the dominant in the room they have the support from colleagues and the authority and in real life there's no ÿ±ŸÇÿßÿ®ÿ© ,the authorities don't do anything to correct the system ( bad teachers are part of this system , don't even get me started about the corrupt ŸÖÿØŸäÿ±ŸäŸÜ ) and when we wanna expose this system the boomers call us disrespectful and ungrateful everytime,  in a country where they think of the little kids as nothing where in other countries children are the entite future of the country ( japan has sush thoughtful and careful system for the kids , I highly recommend checking documentaries about it)

Due to special circumstances, I have to renew my passport. However, this is not possible if it is still valid for longer than 6 months.

BUT, if there are no pages left on the passport then you can renew it no matter what.

So I abused a ""thaghra"" in the system: Whenever you buy foreign currency from a bank, they stamp a full page on your passport that the transaction happened. Therefore, I bought and sold back small amounts to the bank, resulting in a filled passport.

And voil√†, I succesfully used bureaucracy against bureaucracy :D

Edit: Damaging the passport or claiming that you lost it will result in months of waiting time (up to a year), in addition to a 150dt fee.

Edit: If you need the currency, no need to sell it back. And if you plan on reselling don't do everything in the same day, so that it doesn't look suspicious.",,,,,,2020-07-02 23:11:24

I am born a native Arabic speaker and I speak English at a near-native level. I am interested in knowing what my options are for teaching in Tunisia as a foreigner. Would schools be interested in hiring English-speaking Math teachers? Would learning French boost my chances of securing employment? How is the process like for getting a work permit?

Following the last meta post, We announced we would be accepting applications for new moderators. We're a bit shorthanded right now, we we will be looking to add around 2 new moderators, maybe 3.

What do you have to do as a mod ? Not much. This is what we're looking for :

* A bit of experience on Reddit, so you know how it works here. Moderating experience isn't required but appreciated.

* A firm interest in Tunisia. Moderating here should be a pleasure and not a chore, it's volunteer work after all. It doesn't mean you have to be tunisian, just that you're connected enough to it.

* Free time. Take a look at the sub frequently, flair unflaired posts, check for any reports or rule breaking comments, etc.

These bonus would be nice, but are in no way a requirement: 

* CSS knowledge. Reddit uses it to design subreddits (at least for the old reddit, i'm not too informed abotu the redesign) and for automoderator functions.

* Using the r/tunisia chat. We used to have a moderator for the chat only but they have since gone inactive. So if you frequent the chat, you can help out there.

* Any Suggestions of big changes in the subreddit and their implementation can get you a moderator seat. You can suggest those in the form I'm about to present you.

So do you wanna apply to be a moderator here ? [You can do so through this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfGyojuiCa2Nfk8iPaODlRiHNkd4fPSODCxgco58GVApZmmHA/viewform?usp=sf_link). It takes a couple minutes to fill.

This is gonna be a short one
So let me say something.
According to Islam woman and men can't get the same heritage.
But!!!!!
According to Islam all of the man's money belongs to his wife .
And all of the wife's money is still her money.
By islamic standards a man is required to spend on his wife.
He has to buy her stuff.
She can use his car but he can't use her's without consent.
So, men nowadays don't follow these rules.
They are cheap selfish bastards .
They don't wanna spend a single penny on their wife.
So if that's the case, then heritage equality is the only solution.
Either you follow all of the islamic rules
Or you just don't .
You can't wine about gender equality while you're a cheap filthy man .
There is a video by an imam who explained this btw
I'll link it when I find it .

hpax5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/hpax5j/,1,"Islam is the Truth and the Perfect Religion, but only for people living in the harsh and unforgiving environment of the Arabian Desert in Medieval Times ?","Imagine you live in a Small Island.

In this Island, there are Toxic Mushrooms. They are beautiful, smell wonderful, and tastes  heavenly. They are also very nutritious and grow everywhere. You can just pick one, eat it and be full for the day. But they are Toxic. If you eat a certain amount over a certain period, very quickly , you'll get sick.

You will loose your hair, loose your strength, and die as a repulsive, crippled old man before you turn 30. You always knew that of course. Your father, your grand father, your teachers, the King of the Island, everyone always told you : never eat those toxic Mushrooms ! They are the devil's gift !

They showed you many times the poor fools who got hungry, ate them in secret and turned into brainless zombies. You saw the baby goat of your father's herd who died a horrible death because of those toxic mushrooms. You KNOW, you are certain, you are absolutely convinced that those mushrooms are lethal, and that you must never eat them !

You love your family and your people. You don't want them to die or suffer. You want them to live a long and happy life. So you make rules for the ones who don't know about these mushrooms and never saw the horrible things that happens to those who eats them.

But your little brother goes like :

Those Mushrooms look sooo tasty bro. If I just have a bite, it won't kill me rig... NO ! CERTAINLY NOT ! THOSE MUSHROOMS ARE SUPER ADDICTIVE ! IF YOU TAKE A BITE YOU'LL NEVER STOP ! AND YOU'LL KEEP EATING THEM UNTIL YOU DIE !

You love your little brother. But he is not aware of the danger as he doesn't understand anything about hygiene and food poisoning.

And you don't have time to teach him patiently. You are too busy and you have too many siblings younger than you. So you threaten to cut off his hand if you ever learn that he touched a Mushroom. And that if he puts a Mushroom in his mouth, he will rot in hell for all eternity. You even forbid him to talk about eating Mushrooms, because you don't want him to influence his younger brothers. It's for his own good.

Eventually, your little brother moves out in a Big Island for studies. And he realizes that everyone here eats Toxic Mushrooms. They just pick them up and eat them in front of his face. He feels that something is really wrong here. So he starts telling everyone : are you insane ? If you keep eating those Mushrooms you will rot in hell !

Everyone from Big Island calls him an idiot and a savage. Who is this foreigner who doesn't even speak our language correctly and wears funny clothes ? Where did he find the audacity to tell us what to do ?

Turns out Toxic Mushrooms are a very important part of the Culture of Big Islanders. They always eat them for lunch. Actually, Toxic Mushrooms allowed them to create powerful Machines and conquer the World, because they never starved and could spend more time inventing stuff than focusing on food.

Also : THE MUSHROOM HAVE NEVER BEEN TOXIC ! But the soil of Little Island turned them poisonous...because the soil and the climate is not good for them and made them sick. The Mushrooms originally came from Big Island where the Environment is perfect for their growth !

But your brother doesn't understand that, because nobody is willing to teach something to someone they do not respect. Also the people in power do not need their people to understand things. They want passive obedient workers and consumers who make machines and buy the stuff the machines produce.

Your brother feels lonely and struggles to make friends. He also starts getting crazy ideas. He's getting jealous of these arrogant pricks who feels superior to Little Islanders. He wants to live in a big house like them, and sleeps with their women who laughs at him and look at him like garbage.

He gets depressed. Takes drugs. Sees prostitutes. Plays with his parents' money. He knows it's wrong but at least he is not eating Mushrooms so he's still going to Heaven.

He fails his studies, becomes a criminal get caught by the police then released but doesn't want to go back to Little Island, because Little Island is shit anyway run by people who are shit, and you are shit because you abandoned him because you don't know anything, and couldn't teach him how the world actually works and he makes more money than you from the drugs he sells, and he even forgot his language but still not a real Big Islander because he hates them, he hates everyone including himself, nobody loves him and he loves nobody, the world is pure garbage and he hopes he will die quickly and go to heaven because he never ate Mushrooms and never will, so deep inside, he knows he's still had done the RIGHT THING.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You should have been more patient with your little brother.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT FROM COMMENT :  

The whole point of the post since some didn't  get it :

In  societies where resources are abundant, people become liberal. In  societies where resources are scarce, people become conservative.

Technology can make resources more abundant.

In a decade, people living in extreme conditions can start living in palaces (Dubai).

Problem  : culture takes time to adjust to new stages of resources availability.  So you have something called a ""clash of civilization"".

Toxic  Mushrooms are pork. Porks are dangerous in arid environments because  they destroy the fragile eco-systems of Oasis. So they were banned and  cursed in the middle-east a long time ago.

But Pork is a blessing elsewhere, and necessary for survival (China, South America...)

That was the first part of the post.

In  second part, I raise the case of Kassos, French Maghrebians stuck in  the dogmatism of their parents and grand-parents, isolated by the  ""Fran√ßais de Souche"" in cultural ghettos and used as cheap labour, who  sometimes fall in an endless pit of depression, crime etc.",,,,,,2020-07-11 14:30:58
hpf367,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/hpf367/,4,Is Western LGBTQ+ community responsible for increased homophobia in the Muslim World ?,"I feel some gay activist are more looking for attention that actually trying to help people struggling with their sexuality in traditional societies.

I think people representing the LGBT community who dress and act provocatively are causing tremendous harm, by giving the wrong image of lgbt to people who are not ready for it.

Here are a few elements to explain the whole issue here : 

There is actually no such thing as ""gay"", ""lesbian"", or ""trans"" people, from a pure scientific standpoint at least.

These  are extremely new identity concepts which emerged in 19th century, when  scientists tried to classify people into clearly distinctive  categories. Gay identity came later, when everyone started being more  ""individualistic"", meaning creating an identity on their own, rather  than identifying oneself exclusively with the identity imposed by their  community. People started acting and building their identity based on  their ""feelings"" first, rather than the beliefs received by their peers.

Aggressive  and cringy gay activism can be justified in extremely repressive  environment where people are excluded, discriminated, bullied or even  killed for their choices of partner, ergo SOME of them will naturally  regroup into political factions to valorize their rights as individuals.  Please note that the vast majority of ""LGBT"" people are not part of the  LGBT ""community"" and just want to live a peaceful, modest life,  respected and accepted by others, without any special rights or status.

Even if I support LGBT activists, I do not support their methods, ideology nor beliefs.

Why ?

Because  most people today, straight or gay, have a perception of sex,  relationships, intimacy and love that is simply wrong and outdated.

Same-sex  relationships have always been there, even among animals. Primates,  birds, most mammals have occasionally same-sex relationships. Sex is not  only sought by living beings for reproduction, but also for ""shared  pleasure"", especially among extremely social creatures like humans  which, in primitive communities, still use sex as a mean to prevent  conflicts or create long-lasting bonds. We could say it's the Ooga-Booga  way of sharing a cup of tea. ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZwvrxVavnQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZwvrxVavnQ))

Sex  is fun, but also very dangerous. Because it makes babies. And depending  on climate, environment, and resources, people don't necessarily have  the mean to allow new comers in their community, which affects their  perception of Life and Death.

In some Amerindian and Polynesian tribes, people had a very liberal outlook of Life and Death.

Tahitian  thought death was just a changing of state, that nothing really dies,  just changes. They believed in primitive human beliefs of reincarnation :  when you die you become a spirit of nature, you flow in trees, rivers,  rocks, animals, the Heavens, etc. There is no Hell or eternal  punishment. Thus they had a very positive outlook of life and were not  afraid of death.

Also, they lived  in a state of ABUNDANCE . They could find everything they needed in  Nature. Everyday. And acquire food, medicine, construction materials for  shelter with minimum physical labour. They did not have to think or  make plans for the future, because they had complete faith of what  nature could offer them. No four seasons, drought, or inundations.

They  also lived in EQUALITY. There were no social classes or discrimination.  All resources were shared equally between different members. They lived  in relative isolation from other human groups and always knew each  other. The size of the tribe was around 50-300 people. So loneliness and  boredom was rarely a thing.

SEX  was shared the same way as food : equally, without restraint. If you  like someone and she likes you, she will simply tie her hammock next to  yours and that's it for marriage.

If  some day she doesn't like you any more because you've been a jerk, she  will simply untie her hammock and that's it for divorce. You may go back  together one day, or maybe not. It doesn't matter. Being single or  taken doesn't change ANYTHING to your situation.

You  will always belong to your clan and you will always feel useful and  loved. You made children ? That's great. You'll never have children ?  That's great too ! You hunted down three boars and catched 20 fishes  today ? That's cool fam thank you. You never catched anything in your  life ? It's all right brother, we love you no matter what, besides you  are a great story teller.

Now  let's look at another Tribe : the Beni Quraysh living in the small  Bedouin settlements around the sacred site of Mecca. People are  surrounded by Desert, an Ocean of Sand, where they can't get any food.  People survive by trading goods from Yemen to Oasis, to the powerful  Empires surrounding them : the Eastern Roman Empire and the Sassanian  Empire, fighting each other. Survival is very hard. You have to be  careful of each of your actions, of what you eat, of what you drink, and  you need to make a lot of calculation about who is your enemy, who is  your friend, what action will get me food and a shelter, etc...

**The more resources are scarce and hard to get, the more the culture, religions and beliefs are hard on people**.

Abrahamic  religion (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) all came from the people living  in the same environment : nomads raising cattle and making trade in an  extremely dangerous world.

In this  kind of world, two things are rigorously controlled in order to ensure  survival of the group : food and sex. You can't eat pork (pork is  dangerous in arid climate because they need a lot of water thus destroys  the fragile eco-systems of Oasis), can't drink alcohol (it causes  dehydration), can't have sex with anyone you want (if you don't have  enough resources you can't afford raising a child.)

It's more complicated than that, but you get it.

Now  after 100 000 years of hard work, we can say we live in the first  global society of abundance in history.  We produce more food than we  need. It's very rare to starve to death nowadays... and if we do it's  because the distribution of resources have been unequally distributed.

We  can say we are starting to live a life closer to the Polynesians tribes  in Pacific Ocean...but our culture and beliefs are still the one's from  people who lived a life of restrictions.

Now back to sex and LGBT :

Sex is a very intimate way to express your love and appreciation for another individual, and create powerful bond with him.

Human  sexuality is also very fluid and can change over a lifetime. There are  no such thing as strict ""gay"" or ""straight"" people. This is utter  bullshit.

To some degree, everyone  can feel attracted to people from the same gender, depending on  circumstances. Many men who made history had sexual relationships with  dudes.

Julius Caesar had many  boyfriends while having several wives and concubines. Bro sex was very  common in all times and places. The Spartian, the Athenians, The  Minoans, the Persian, the Aztecs, even the Muslim Ottomans. Falling  in  love with same gender was not considered wrong back then...however  getting sodomized was frown upon if you were a Man.

If  you are the sodomizer, then you cool, but if you let yourself getting  sodomized then you are being passive, and being passive for a man is  extremely wrong in hard societies who rely on strong warriors etc.  passivity in sex being reserved to women. (Most Bro Sex was mutual  masturbation and hugging).

We  might then say that the hate of men who enjoy getting sodomized stems  from strict gender roles in hard societies. This is why Misogyny and  Homophobia are generally strongly related.

Some  people are afraid that the increasing visibility of LGBT might harm  society and push youth toward an irresponsible lifestyle (getting AIDS,  taking drugs, or becoming prostitutes), and if you see how repulsive  SOME gay activists look like in Gay Prides, you might develop this  sentiment.

But actually it's  impossible to ""influence"" sexual orientation. It's like people who hate  chocolate and prefer vanilla. Personal tastes do not have to be  justified in a modern society and you should not be judged for your  preferences.",,,,,,2020-07-11 18:33:29

I‚Äôm also glad that after Fakhfakhs resignation he then removed the Ennahda ministers from office and now they‚Äôre getting signatures to vote on removing confidence from Ghannouchi, this seems like the dissolve of Ennahda. What do you think?

I‚Äôm aware the government is still in chaos but this is the right step taken to move to a more law abiding Tunisia, where no one is above the law as Kais Saied preached about in his campaign.

imagine someone makes a parody of a Bible 
verse talking the corona virus in a light hearted meme joking way. sounds alright to me and its common online. 

*6 months jail. the Tunis court rules out*

so today I saw a Facebook page that has couple funny memes so I joined the group and I saw a post about her so I checked the comments. 

- ""who's she?"" 
- *explanation* 
- ""yikes you can even rape the bitch and it'll be fair play lol"" [struggled to translate the quote word by word but same idea] 

- ""atheist are the most vile of filthy rabid dogs and I wish I can + (long list of violence acts)"" 

- couple comments pointing out other people doing worse and not under arrest and they got attacked by people for trying to defend the girl 

- more of the same closed minded Islamic/religious fanatics that I grew up surrounded with before I left the country 3 years ago. 

I closed the thread and immediately left without turning back. 

you have no idea how degenerate and repulsive the whole thread was and the few few people who pointed out how bad this looks were ripped apart. 

it was horrifying unironically. 

the amount of violent vile acts cited down by guys and the many ""only 6 months??"" 

comments reminded me just of how hard growing up in this country is surrounded by extreme violent attitude , fucked up fanatical mentalities and cult brainwashing since young age 

I barely has 2 screenshots saved before I immediately exited the cesspool

hu0j6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/hu0j6o/,11,A few questions as a foreigner,"The first question is about the language. I know that the main languages are Berber, Arabic, and French. I want to know to what extent is the French language used in everyday life. Can I easily communicate on a street by speaking french? Another language question is about Arabic. I've been learning Arabic a bit in my spare time, but I am learning the Egyptian dialect. Can I speak with Tunisians and will they understand me? The same question applies to English. Can I make it in Tunisia with mostly English

The second question is about the time one should spend in Tunisia. How much time is enough to get a general feel of the country. Is a week (including flights) enough or is a week not enough.

Now the last set of questions is more about the people and customs. So haggling is a big part of market culture. What are some haggling methods one could use if I don't really speak Arabic or French well? My wish with every country where I travel is to meet and get to know locals, so what would be the best way to meet and get to know local people aged like me? 

Thanks for reading this post through, I appreciate every response :) If you have any tips or suggestions about cities, towns, attractions, places, etc. feel free to suggest them.",,,,,,2020-07-19 13:32:02

* The server will be restarted sometimes as I work on it

* The server will be wiped (probably) once I figure out plugins (In a couple of weeks)

* The server will allow pirated Minecraft (Or should, if not, please let me know)

* I am the admin of the server and I will run it as I see fit.  Who is allowed and banned is solely up to me.  Please keep that in mind.

* This server is in no way affiliated with /r/Tunisia other than this is the only place I know where a group of Tunisians to be that would play it for now

* The server is up 24 hours a day and is hosted in France.

* There will be some fun games added later when I can figure out the basics.

* The server is Java only. 

Tomorrow, I will be on as much as possible to mess around in it.  I will probably give resources of all kinds out freely during this 2 week period of time.  If things are not going your way (struggling to start) just let me know.

hzcoxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/hzcoxe/,3,Why Islam came to be ?,"&amp;#x200B;

I assume it is accurate to describe Muhammad as a social justice warrior. No, not your stereotypical dyed haired angry NPC. I'm talking about someone who lived most of his childhood as a low-key orphan, despised and ignored by the population of Mecca, and would probably have died of hunger and disease if it wasn't for his uncle, and then his hot sugar momma Khadija who married him when he was 20 and made him her most prolific employee. Infinitely grateful for these acts of pure selflessness, Muhammad dedicated most of his early life in helping the people in need, redistributing his money if he could.

Wealth distribution wasn't really a thing among pre-islamic Arabic tribes. There wasn't any code or strong institutions for regulating the flows of exchange, taxes, punishments, help for the needy and so on. Every tribe was more or less living on their own terms and laws and it was extremely difficult to communicate and settle a dispute between them. There was a generic law called the ""Price of Blood"" where you had to pay a certain tribute if you damaged someone else property or family member. Society was pretty democratic. People elected their Sheikh to lead them and he could be overthrown any time. All Arabs shared a considerable hate and despise for all aristocratic societies. They were proud people who would not bow or submit to any foreign powers. Just like the Mongols (same social organization and conditions of life more or less).

Arab world was tough. Some people had to be left behind for the survival of the tribe. Weak people. Unwanted children were buried alive (a common practice in primitive societies), orphans were abandoned and left to die, old people had to leave in the fiery desert and never come back...

Then something changed. Global trade started to evolve at an unprecedented scale. The great powers of that time (Eastern Roman Empire and Sassanide Empire) fought for resources. Ethiopia and Abyssinia (Yemen), would regularly colonize Arabia and try to submit the locals to their will (they talked about a fight against Ethiopians whit their Elephants in Quran, Surah 105)

Arabs were basically the ""free folks"" stuck between despotic monarchies and empires who controlled their subjects through religion. Arabs were very religious ofc. They worshipped Jesus, Abraham, Mary, Moses, the moon god Hubal and his three daughters Allatu, Al Manatu and Al Uzzah. They had statues of them in Kaaba, that was protecting the water source Zam Zam (the sole reason why it was build in the first place)

They had religious practices similar to the Hindus and other pagans folks : they worshipped black volcanic stones and meteors (called Linga in India). The most important black stone is still fixed to one of the Kaaba angles and looks like a vagina with a baby head sprouting out, probably used for a fecundity cult.

Monotheism was not unknown to the Arabs, and some of them, the ""Hanif"" tried to restore Abraham's original religion many years before the prophet was born. Jews and Christians were also roaming free in the desert and among the most powerful tribes in Arabia converted to Judaism.

Muhammad may had been sensitive to the Christian, Jewish and Hanif influences for they promoted forgiveness, morality, social justice, wealth redistribution (they were basically the commies of their time), and of course, the worship of a SINGLE God.

Monotheism restoration was a big deal, because every tribe was worshipping it's own god (an ancestor, a powerful predator, or an antique divinity), which was a dividing factor (oh no, we can't submit to your laws, OUR god doesn't like it)

Monotheism is a  very efficient tool for power centralization. The Egyptian Pharaoh, Akhenaton, was the first to implement it in Egypt, centuries before Judaism even became a thing.

Muhammad craved order, justice and unity. He could not suffer all the injustices he was witnessing around him : infanticide, slavery, exploitation of women, tribalism, and greed.

All of this was maintained because of the ruling elite of Mecca, the Quraish, who monopolized resources and wealth for themselves (Mecca was an important trading hub at that time, mainly because of Zam-Zam). People from their clan were more advantaged than the others.

They were slowly turning into an aristocratic family.

Muhammad wanted them to restore the Arabs original credo of regular democratic election of leaders, BUT under a common immutable set of moral and legal codes that no one could change.

*That's what original Islam was all about, and why it's so tempting : submit yourself to God's law that is eternal, but not to human government that only benefits the ones in power.*

*A celestial government based on an eternal tradition is definitely fairer than a despotic government who can change the law as it pleases. That's what Islamists today are thinking when they want to overthrow liberal democracy, as they believe  it will always be corrupted by powerful third party interests, like fortune 100 companies, ""the media"", and unscrupulous salesman. Unconsciously, some Muslims believe that without Islamic laws, everything will go back to the stage of pre-islamic arab society, and anarchy and injustice would prevail (ofc it already does in Muslim society but Islamists will tell you it's because the government doesn't follow True Islam)*

It's important to point out that he didn't make Islam up out of selfish interests : many of his beloved ones died because of his cause, and there wasn't the slightest chance that he would win. He lived in Mecca for ten years in fear, spreading his ideal discreetly, facing discriminations, harassment and death threats all day long. Also he ALWAYS forgave even his worst enemies, (even the crazy bitch who ate his best friend liver under his eyes) at the condition that they converted and recognized him as the Prophet of God.

Unfortunately, he died before electing his successor, if he ever planned to have a successor at all. He never outlined how an Islamic government should look like, and how leaders should be chosen...

Problem is, maybe he never heard of modern democratic institutions like the one used by the Greeks and Romans. And primitive tribal democracy only works when everyone knows each other. So you couldn't apply the same system to a larger scale, engulfing ALL Muslims in the same system.

Eventually came the four wise Caliph, successor of Muhammad and then everything went all ape shit, aristocracies and royalties, Arabs worst nightmares eventually became the norm in the Muslim world.

Islamists claim the need to erase all this heritage, that the system implemented by Muhammad in Medina was the only model of government all Muslim governments should copy.

**So !  If you are a liberal and you don't like Political Islam because you think it's irrelevant, you need to understand why it is important for so many people in the first place !**

**Otherwise how can you propose something that sounds better to them ?**

A part of Politics is mostly about creating feelings. If you don't understand the origins of these feelings, of these beliefs, you cannot talk to people the right way, and will end up being called a bigot.

And we will never make progress.",,,,,,2020-07-28 11:03:59

hzy2m4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/hzy2m4/,3,What People Get Wrong About The Veil.,"There is no such thing as Islamic Veil. King of Morocco was pretty clear about it : it doesn't exist.

Women have been covering up their hairs in all Eurasian societies for millennia.

My great grand-mother from my French side, for instance, would have never let her hair flow freely around her face in public.

Everyone from Slav nations can testify of the prevalence of the veil in older generations.

Women do not wear the veil out of ""patriarchal oppression"", but because of different conception of Modesty (pudeur) in the society they live in.

Problem is, people do not share the same perception of Modesty.

According to Wikipedia :

&amp;#x200B;

***Modesty***\*\*, sometimes known as\*\* ***demureness***\*\*, is a mode of dress and deportment which intends to avoid the encouraging of\*\* [*sexual attraction*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_attraction) *in others. The word ""modesty"" comes from the Latin word* [*modestus*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/modestus) *which means ""keeping within measure"".*[*\[1\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modesty#cite_note-Jennett,_Sheila_2001-1)  *Standards of modesty are culturally and context dependent and vary  widely. In this use, it may be considered inappropriate or immodest to  reveal certain parts of the body. In some societies, modesty may involve  women covering their bodies completely and not talking to men who are  not immediate family members; in others, a fairly revealing but* [*one-piece bathing costume*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-piece_swimsuit) *is considered modest while other women wear* [*bikinis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikini)*.  In some countries, exposure of the body in breach of community  standards of modesty is also considered to be public indecency, and* [*public nudity*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_nudity) *is generally illegal in most of the world and regarded as* [*indecent exposure*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indecent_exposure)*. For example,* [*Stephen Gough*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Gough)*, a lone man attempting to walk naked from south to north in the* [*United Kingdom*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom)*, was repeatedly imprisoned.*[*\[2\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modesty#cite_note-2) *However, nudity is at times tolerated in some societies; for example by* [*Digambara*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digambara) *monks in India, who renounce clothing for* [*ascetic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascetic) *reasons, and during a* [*World Naked Bike Ride*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Naked_Bike_Ride)*.*[*\[3\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modesty#cite_note-3)

&amp;#x200B;

I would personally love to roam the streets naked, unleash my John from ""Panties Oppression"", but most people in the society I live in do not find this behaviour appropriate in the public space. And I would end up in Jail and be labelled a Perverted Deranged F\*\*ker for the rest of my life.

In some Amazonian and African Tribes, however, living completely bare naked all the time is perfectly normal. People wearing clothes are actually perceived as weirdos in their societies and they be like "" what are you hiding behind this piece of fabric, bruh ? What terrible things have you done ?""

Let's make this clear and sound :

For many reasons, Some Women feel uncomfortable showing their hair or face in public. Yes, maybe they have been raised that way, but so had I. Who forced me to wear clothes and never expose my genitals in public ? My parents. Do I feel oppressed ? Absolutely not. It's just how Modesty work in Western culture and society. If I ever feel the need to walk completely naked in public, I would join a nudist club and expose my genitals to as many people as I want, and without breaking the law, or I could just join an African Tribe... INGETA !

Some Women feel comfortable wearing very light and revealing clothings. They are not doing it to provoke and elicit sexual desire in other Men. They just enjoy it. And there is nothing wrong about it. Unless they live in a society with tighter Modesty standards. And that could be a problem.

There are other extreme cases that some Conservatives really love pointing out, where some fragments of a liberal society ""encourages"" girls to wear ""suggestive"" clothings, to ""objectify"" themselves. It's quite debatable ! I never met a single ""light clothing"" girl who seemed genuinely oppressed. But it is true that the high beauty standards set by fashion and porn industry can hold a lot of pressure on young prepubescent girls who will feel constantly ashamed of how they look...but we could say the same about Muslim societies, where girls are also pressured to look nice, even with traditional outfit.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, how can people with different Modesty standards live together ? By learning how to just minding their own f\*\*\*ing business, I guess.

New York City has recently authorized Women to walk chest naked in the streets without any penalties. The vast majority of Female New Yorkese do not show their breast in public, but a minority does now. So we're making progress !

Maybe, one day, Matriarchy Oppression will finally lift up and I will enjoy the pleasure of doing by Jogging BALL FREE.

i1zpuj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/i1zpuj/,22,"freedom, body integrity, sexuality and the conservative madness","The conserative view on sexuality is completely disconnected from reality and that causes harm to both individuals and any society in which they are applied as a whole. I'll speak about transgenders, circumcision, homosexuality and the anti-scientific approach conservatives have to these issues. I will explain why allowing homsexuals and transgender people to exist and have their rights protected will help them and society. I will also explain why I think infant circumcision should be made illegal.

I'll begin with the most obvious, and the easiest one for people to understand : having the right to sleep with whoever you want is a basic right.

- *Comparision to zoophilia and pedophilia*. When the conservative will try to argue against homosexuality they will often make a slipery slope fallacy in which homosexuality will allow zoophilia and pedophilia. that a logical fallacy called slippery slope. And sometimes they will compare homosexuality to zoophilia and pedophilia, this is also another logical fallacy, a false analogy. In a homosexual relationship between 2 adults there is consent, and there's no harm done to the people involved in the act. And absolutely no harm done to any other person.

- *Unnatural* : This is another logical fallacy : an appeal to nature. We can't say something is good or bad because it is natural or unnatural. Cancer is natural, it is still not a good thing. These people use phones and watch TV. You can't get more unnatural than that. In addition, they will defend circumcision to the death which is a surgery which actually harms the body and causes damage (I'll get to the details later)

- *religion* : Religion is about a subjective ""truth"", that's why we use the term ""belief"" instead of knowledge. In addition the religious interpretations are very very different : You can still be muslim, be okay with homosexuality and against circumcision. The quran says nothing about homosexuality and muslims quote ""no compulsion in religion"" and ""you have your religion and I have mine"" all the time. Fucking practice what you preach. If you believe these quotes are valid, then you are a secular muslim and should be progressive aswell. And if you believe homosexuals will go to hell, we genuinely do not care. Keep it to yourself.

Circumcision

This is one should be very fucking obvious but people need explanation of the science behind it and why it was advocate for in the past, but is a dying practice everywhere and should be banned (at least for children and teens)

- *First, there's no benefit*. They will mention that it decreases some infections but they will never tell you the details. And the devil is in the details. The doctor will tell you that circumcision will decrease the rate of UTI (an infection) by 60% IN THE FIRST YEAR AFTER BIRTH ONLY (basically a prevention). This sounds big, but, they say the RR instead of the DR for a reason, the risk of UTI for uncircumcised children  is already low : 1%. And an immediate risk of complication DURING the surgery alone (not after it, just during it) is 2%. This includes a vast range of complication which include death. And UTI is a treatable disease. Another claim is AIDS. In the US they used to cicumcise but not in Europe, yet the rate was much higher in the US than Europe.  There are much better and more efficient ways to deal with AIDS than circumcision. I'm going to be charitable and use the studies which favor the most circumcision : reduces transmission from female to male by 60%, but has no effect on transmission from male to female. Using a condom and abstinating from having sex with random people + legalizing homosexuality have a much much better effect on reducing AIDS. 

- *The harm* :  Here is where most people don't know the truth. The complications of the surgery can literally destroy the life of the person. For example, when you circumcise a child under a certain age it is dont WITHOUT anesthesia. This is obviously torture. And the excuse ""he will not remember"" is factually incorrect and makes it even more immoral. We don't torture people affected by Alzheimers and justify it with ""he will not remember"". an act is immoral independant of the capacity to remember. Harm that is done to most people and is NOT REVERSIBLE is loss of sensitivity, and the loss of pleasure during sexual intercourse. Also women report having more pleasure, less pain and dryness with uncircucumcised men. Does this mean circumcied men are inferior for women ? no, use lube mf. there is more harm than this. For example, many men lose comfort in their day to day life because of friction with clothes or other minor things that should not be inconvinient.

- *Hygiene* : using water and soad is necessary. We don't advocate cutting ears because they can get dirty, we clean them. It is the same for the foreskin. Just wash.

- *personal choice* : many men regret having been circumcised in many parts of the world ESPECIALLY if they know the facts behind it. There's a study which shows that well informed adults are less satisfied with their circumcision (some get into depression, and/or seek the help of a therapist). Circumcising a child is by definition sexual assault. There's no good evidence that it is harder to circumcise adults or that it has worst outcomes, and even if it has worse outcomes for adults, it is not an excuse to circumcised every male. Having read the studies put forth to prove that circumcision has better outcomes when performed on children, these studies have many problems. For example, they follow the adults for months or years after the surgery and take note of the complications which happen DURING and AFTER the surgery. But, they don't do that for the children, they only take note of the complications which happen DURING the surgery. If you are a muslim and still want to circumcise, you can do it when you grow up, at any time you want. Just don't push it so that others be circumcised aswell.

- *phimosis and some other disease which are treated by circumcision* : Circumcision is used to TREAT these illnesses and not to PREVENT them. So routine circumcision can not be justified on this basis. In addition many of these pathologies can be treated through much less invasive ways. And using the existence of these pathologies to justify circumcision is as stupid as saying : migraine exists therefore we should all seek the teatment for it, or cancer exists therefore we should all use chemo.

I have a burden of proof, Here are some studies and quotes.

""The AAP does not recommend routine circumcision."" The AAP is the American Academy of Pediatrics.
""However, they said that because of the possible benefits, parents should have the option to circumcise their sons if they want to. They recommend that parents discuss circumcision with their baby's health care provider. Parents should make their decision based on the benefits and risks, as well as their own religious, cultural, and personal preferences.""

We wouldn't allow FGM using the excuses of ""personal preference"" (there are many types of FGM some of which are as harmful as male circumcision). Or we wouldn't excuse the 

https://medlineplus.gov/circumcision.html

""Risks related to circumcision:

Bleeding

Infection

Redness around the surgery site

Injury to the penis

Some research has suggested that uncircumcised male infants have an increased risk of certain conditions, including:

Cancer of the penis

Certain sexually transmitted diseases, including¬†HIV

Infections of the penis

Phimosis (tightness of the foreskin that prevents it from retracting)

Urinary tract infections

The overall increased risk for these conditions is thought to be relatively small.

Proper hygiene of the penis and safe sexual practices can help prevent many of these conditions. Proper hygiene is especially important for uncircumcised males.""

This article even clearly states ""Proper hygiene of the penis and safe sexual practices can help prevent many of these conditions. Proper hygiene is especially important for uncircumcised males.""

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002998.htm

""Penile problems, such as irritation, inflammation, and infection, are more common in uncircumcised males. It's easier to keep a circumcised penis clean, although uncircumcised boys can learn how to clean beneath the foreskin once they're older.
Some people claim that circumcision lessens the sensitivity of the tip of the penis, decreasing sexual pleasure later in life. But none of these subjective findings are conclusive.""

know that there are article which CONFIRM there's a loss of sensitivity. Basically, the glans starts making keratin to protect itself from the enivronment and lose sensitivity with time : that's why just after circumcision men are more uncomfortable in they day to day life than after a long period of time : the glans loses sensitivity. Also, these changes are the cause of feelings of dryness during intercourse.

The last one, about why many are many men satisfied with their circumcision :

https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13691058.2017.1400104


Transgenders

This topic is the most difficult to explain because most people don't understand the basic concepts behind it.

- *Gender and sex* : these are not the same thing. Gender is more the way you behave/think. And sex is the biological sex. Basically gender is used to force people act/think a certain way and those who don't fit these patterns of behavior will identify with a different gender. I think gender should be abolished. When it comes to sex that's a completely different discussion.

- *Defining woman* : we can define woman in many different ways, but ulitimately it is hard to define. We have a similar problem with many other words. Some will say ""If she can give birth, then she's a woman"", but many women can't give birth since birth. So the easiest definition, is having a vagina or a penis. A surgery can simply change the a penis into a vagina now. This something that can be done and is practiced in med. The external genital organ for males and females share the same embryonic origin which only change shape.

- *defining man* : We face the same problems as with defining woman.

- *Freedom to do whatever you want with your body* : Don't you find it wierd that conservatives think forced circumcision on children is okay but changing one's OWN sex is unacceptable to them ? Well, this is why we think they're backwards and inconsistent. They defend immoral practices then attack people who are not harming anybody.

Conservatives :

- *Inconsistencies* :  they will defend circumcision on children who can not consent any day, and justify it with ""religious freedom"", but they will deny homosexuals their rights religious freedom. This is why when a tunisian conservative mentions religious freedom, you know they are lying. The status quo in Tunisia is anti-religious freedom and even anti-freedom of speech in many cases. Being conservative in Tunisia means you either want to defend that horrible status quo or make it worse.

- *Logical fallacies and hypocrisy* : they make many different logical fallacies in their reasoning. But if they really thought unnatural things are bad for example, they would stop using phones, wearing clothes and will just become anarcho-primitivists. And they're not anarcho-primitivists. In addition they expect homosexuals to never have sex, while every heterosexual man will have his sexual desires satisfied. So conservatives are by definition hypocrites.

- *They harm the country* : They want to force their SUBJECTIVE preferences on other ADULTS and treat them like CHILDREN. They cause division among people and alienate many minorities just to achieve their goal which is not even a moral or valuable one. for example, saying that Tunisia must have a muslim government because it has a muslim majority is not only  MISUNDERSTANDING OF WHAT DEMOCRACY MEANS, but is also ANTI-REVOLUTION. They ignore that tunisians can be non-muslim, not straight and have many other characteristics and STILL BE TUNISIAN.",,,,,,2020-08-01 20:59:09

i2f9e6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/i2f9e6/,8,France Never Colonized Africa. The Parisian Bourgeoisie Elite Did.,"Just a quick glance at the history of the French Revolution shows that French People were overall very supportive of the Church, their King and the order they defended. The French Revolution appears to be a coup fomented with the consent of the ""people"", but that's a Republican fallacy.

It was a cultural genocide, where the Parisian Bourgeoisie, oppressed by the growingly parasitic Aristocracy, started claiming their political rights (to make more profits). First, they tried to compromise with the King by establishing a Constitutional Monarchy, but Louis betrayed them and asks his cousins from Germany and Austria to kick Revolutionaries ass. So they cut his head off and butchered everyone who kept clinging to the old order...millions of people were massacred (The Vendean Genocide)

It took 80 years for the Republican ideal to finally implement itself with the promulgation of the Third Republic in 1871. Meanwhile, countless of goods were confiscated from traditional orders... and then given back.

Then, the Republicans started consolidating their power through the invention of the Nationalist ideal and the preservation of their vast colonial empire.

People living in France had nothing to do with it. They were just farmers trying to survive. They had their own culture, tradition, beliefs, language (35 dialects before standard Parisian took over), and overall, their own regional identity. Then they were firmly asked to submit completely to the new order (through public school).

**The cultural genocide African people had faced in the hands of the colonial institution was the same French people suffered from Paris Bourgeoisie that sparkled in 1791.**",,,,,,2020-08-02 16:51:25

I'm a french man working in a distributed company (100% remote) since 2018.Being able to work from everywhere allowed me to visit several cities in France, but now I am thinking about living abroad and maybe discover some north-african countries, a few months at a time.

I am currently interested in Tunisia, it seems to be a beautiful place with nice people, but I don't know exactly in which town I should rent.

I would like, if possible and in order of importance :

1. A place where I can live on foot, without car
2. A place with correct Internet. I don't need high speed, but I need stability
3. A place near the beach ! I would love to work with my laptop next to the sea, and if I can swim a good part of the year it would be even better :)

I also have a few questions :

A) Can I live in Tunisia while only speaking French a probably a bit of Arab I will pick up on the spot ? (Like ""Hello"", ""Thank you"", ""Have a nice day"")

B) What is the cost of living in Tunisia ? What kind of life can I expect with a salary of roughly 1500‚Ç¨ per month ?

C) Other important things I should know before moving there ?

BUT, his performance evoked the topic of freedom of speech and what have you, and as you all know we are all experts when it comes to freedom, politics, and everything else in between. My take personally is who gives a fuck what he said. If it was funny and it made you laugh, good for you. If it didn't and you felt that there was a personal attack on your values or morals then you simply should flip the channel by not watching him. What do you guys think? I mean like I said I don't like him but as far as his jokes go I really couldn't give a rat's ass about them. Surely I'll giggle here and there but that's it. I won't call for his head to roll because of jokes or accuse him of partisanship. He tells jokes for Fanta's sake!!!

Wdym, it‚Äôs a freakin exotic animal, and they know jack shit about maintaining it. Also they don‚Äôt have the right documents to own one. 

So I would like to know what the chances are that they will get caught while trying to bring them back to Belgium. I hope they will find the chameleons before they enter the ferry, because they are driving back from Italy and I‚Äôm afraid they won‚Äôt even survive the long trip.

so if any Tunisian expats living there who can help me setting up a plan to move there please PM me.

I am 22 years old, starting 1 year in ESC ( LG ) this September / October, fluent in German/English/Arabic, Conversational in French, a Beginner in Japanese.

For those wondering why am 22 and just starting as a freshman, I'd be happy to explain that in another post spoiler alert ( broken system ).

1. I am not interested in being an English teacher because am already studying something else.
2. I don't know how Japanese etiquette would help.
3. u/mohamed2657 is way too politically correct

Not so much. I'm writing a book set up in Tunisia, and one of the main characters has dark skin. I don't want to reduce this character solely to his skin color but I thought it might be a good idea to explore the theme of racism, not against strangers but fellow tunisians who happen to ""look differently"" and also how black people are always tied to their ancestry's statut as a slave (the word ""wousif"" used to refer to black people in Arabic Tunisian actually means ""slave"" and not ""dark skinned person"".)

The problem is I never had the chance to be friend with a Tunisian with dark skin ( and I don't live in Tunisia anymore so the chances now are even lower). I thought it might be cool to talk about Arabs and  especially Tunisian's hypocrisy toward racism against dark skin but as a Tunisian girl who happens to look like an european, I didn't witness the bias directly. I know it does exist (thanks to ""3aleh chbini ka7louch?"" expression and many other things...) but in which ways? I don't want to  write about something I don't know about and end up spreading misconceptions by mistake, adding fuel to the fire.

So here I am, asking: Tunisian people of color, how does it feel be both Tunisian and dark skinned? What are the good/bad experience you witnessed? I'm all ears.

ida6lp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/ida6lp/,31,What do you think of the widespread of privates lessons (√©tudes)?,"Every high school student in Tunisia, especially bac students, seems to run multiple private lessons (Maths, physics, science...). When I still was a student, I noticed that teachers wouldn't bother in class since they knew everybody was running private lessons and same goes for students who weren't putting in much effort since they knew they would catch up anyway. 

Normally private lessons should be held for weaker students face to face and focuses on their weaknesses. In Tunisia  it has taken the place of full lectures delivered to a group of 6-10 students while totally stepping on the field of public education. Tunisia loves to brag about its free eduction, but this has totally spoiled it made it only possible for those who can afford it to succeed.

In a kind of a vicious circle, I think that these private lessons crearly caused a drop in the overall teaching quality in public schools, and this drop have forced more and more students to enroll in these private lessons to catch up.

This is the feeling I had while studying in a high school in the suburbs if Tunis. But I believe that this problem can be generalized to the whole country, or at least its coastal part.

I have never made any of the paperwork to have my Tunisian citizenship recognized, and neither did my father. For various personal reasons, I would like to get a Tunisian passport and get my dual-citizenship recognized.

There is a catch however. I am gay. I wouldn‚Äôt expect this to be a major issue in normal conditions, but in this case, it is made very apparent by the fact that I am married, and the union appears clearly in my birth certificate that is required in the process.

I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to face difficulties in the process, despite the fact that I am not asking for citizenship ; I do technically already have it.

I am more concerned however about the risks associated with unequivocally proving my homosexuality in a country where it seems fair to say that tolerance is rather low.

I have Tunisian friends who spam mesaage girls on Instagram and Facebook and to me that's childish and seems pitty tbh (i see the irony coming from a guy posting on reddit) anyway, are there any tips or places where i can meet smart girls with high standards and who are open minded and won't get uncomfortable when someone approaches them?

iy633c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/iy633c/,39,Yes Liberal Islam Is A Real Thing. Here's How It Works :,"When I went to Cambridge, I met a few Muslims from all over the world (one of them was even a pure Irish convert with red hair and sh!t and wore the veil), and I was stricken by how liberal their opinions were :

\- They supported LGBT

\- They believed in freedom of opinion and religion

\- They wished democracy for all

\- One of them was a even a Palestinian Communist

They told me they defended the ""Real Islam"" (whatever that might be) and offered a few relevant key points :

Long ago, was held a big controversy in the Islamic world. Scholars were toiling with the idea of the Quran being created or not.

If the Quran was ""created"", it means it was mainly a set of temporal commands given to the Prophet in order to ensure the survival of his community and the defeat of the Quraysh. As such, every verses should be contextualized and not taken literally.

If the Quran was ""uncreated"", it means it has always been there, waiting in heaven before the beginning of time, and should be the ultimate guideline for every Muslim on the planet at any time.  

The first ones were dubbed the ""rationalists"" or Qadarites. They followed the Prophet's command to ""seek knowledge at every corner of the Earth"" and read all the Greeks and Roman Philosophers. They are the one behind the ""House of Wisdom"" in Baghdad, where all Ancient works got translated in Arabic.  Some names : Ibn Rushd, Al Kindi, Ibn Sina. Their work was then translated in Latin and had a great influence on European scholars.

The rationalists believed that God wanted all Men to use their own judgment and not be coerced by other men's power, since only God has the power to judge man. ""No compulsion in Religion. To you your religion, to me my religion"" says the Quran. As such, tolerance and freedom of choice were essential for humans to reach ""godlike"" qualities, and could never be imposed by force.

They also rejected hadiths that didn't seem to compute with the Quran (ex : ""if someone leaves his religion, kill him""). This is important. the Sunna was only written down 200 years after Muhammad's death, while the Quran was compiled while he was still alive. As such, it's impossible to know if some hadiths are legits or not. 

The problem is that the Sunnis give way too much importance to the Sunna, almost raising it at the same level as the Quran.  Turns out it has always been hearsays and generally made up by the ruling powers of the Omeyya to legitimate their regime. 

Fortunately, the first Abassids supported the rationalist schools and tried to suppress the ""traditional"" one. They failed. The traditionalists got a huge popular support that allowed them to gain political power really quickly, starting off the demise of the ""bright"" Islamic world. 

Then the Mongols came and erased everything the rationalists had done : all their work was thrown into the Tigris. Then the Portuguese discovered new routes, destroying the main source of income for many Islamic states and thus the Arab world was doomed to remain a set of backward societies until today.

The Ottoman managed to liberalize Islam to a great extent, even before Attaturk came along. Everything its secular regime had done was only the prolongation of the new Sultan's policies : freedom of religion, citizenship and civil rights for everyone under his rule, no exclusion, women's right, etc. 

Nobody remembers the rationalists any more, their writings spilled in the dust, even by secularists Arab regimes who are greatly responsible for the rise of Islamism because of their religious intolerance and repression (a woman could not study at the University if she was wearing the veil in Turkey). 

The reason the Traditionalists won is because of environmental and geopolitical factors. First : people subjected to autocratic rule and ruthless obedience with no chance to ""express their individuality"" are easier to control. Second : the Rationalist were all merchants or artisans who travelled a lot and lived comfortable lives (like the Prophet), while the Traditionalists were all Bedouin or farmers, living in horrendous condition...liberalism is too much of a luxury for people who live in these environments. 

It is said that when a Bedouin saw Muhammad kissing a child, he said : ""I have 10 children and never kissed a single one of them"". Then the Prophet responded : those who do not spread mercy will never receive mercy."" So basically, it's two different Arab societies dealing with each other. Muhammad was never a true ""Arab"", which means the same thing as ""Hebrew"", a wanderer, a nomad. Turns out the Nomadic ones prevailed.

Ibn Khaldun always emphasized the destructive nature of the nomadic Arabs, while making a distinction with sedentary Arabs which he always praised.

So the problem is not Islam...it's the Nomads, which are all powerful right now thanks to Petro-dollars.

So guys here's an idea : you can't turn people into better, tolerant individuals by forcing them to believe in ""Reason"" and rejecting their old beliefs. Attaturk, Bourguiba, and the Shah did that and it failed tremendously, giving even more power to the Fundamentalists. The solution is to bring the old Mutazilites Rationalist school back in the game, and promoting the liberal approach of reading and interpreting the Quran.

I recommend : ""Islam without Extremes"" from Mustapha Akyol.

I hear people talking about dating all the time and wanted to know what are the perks of dating? Is it just talking and sharing stories. Do you get into physical intimacy or this is rare? Is it sexual?

I know a girl (not Tunisian) that she was physically intimate with me and we were not in a relationship but now she is abroad. 

So my question is how is dating in Tunisia like. What perks do I get. This girl I think of dating is from sousse and she said that she loves me but she doesn't want to be physically intimate. Like touching hands or kissing. Nevertheless she scrutinizes me if i don't ask how she is doing for one day.

I really hope i get good answers from you guys. And also looking forward to hear some of your experiences in the matter.

  Also short term courses can be helpful if there are any I  should consider.

  All those governmental institutions in those areas doesn't have any multimedia lessons (mostly because I'm interested in learning this), there for privet ones are the way. But  I'm afraid they can be over priced as I heard.  Any  well known privet training centers  with cheap /affordable prices?

j5fqi7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/j5fqi7/,8,Italian Embassy in Tunisia announces its temporary closure due to coronavirus,"  

The new coronavirus is putting diplomacy and the lives of diplomatic personnel in many countries in difficulty. The Italian Embassy in Tunis announced its temporary closure due to the coronavirus emergency, after some of its employees tested positive for COVID-19. Previously, Belgium and Germany also closed their embassies in Tunis due to the virus.

""To protect the health of users and employees and to carry out a new sanitation of the premises, the offices of the Embassy and the Consular Chancellery will remain temporarily closed starting from 1 October until further notice."" The Embassy said in a statement, adding that any appointments already fixed are postponed. ""It will be possible to make a new appointment as soon as health conditions allow the offices to reopen. You can contact the offices by e-mail to report emergencies,"" the note continues.

The checks would be started after an embassy employee who had traveled to Italy in late September was preparing to return to Tunis, testing positive for the new coronavirus. In fact, since last month to enter Tunisia, it is necessary to present a test for the coronavirus, carried out maximum 48 hours before the trip or arrival at the airport. Following the examinations, the embassy found at least three other contagions, including the ambassador's assistant and two external employees. That forced the ambassador and the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to opt for the closure of the diplomatic office in the North African country.

Previously, travelers arriving in Tunisia from Italy were not obliged to quarantine. But the exponential increase in infections in the second wave of the pandemic, recorded in September, led Tunisian authorities to reintroduce mandatory one-week isolation.

The worrying growth of daily coronavirus cases continues in Tunisia, wherein 24 hours 1,308 new infections were recorded, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the North African country to 19,721. According to the latest data of the Ministry of Health, the new coronavirus death toll has risen to 271, 6 in 24 hours. Of the people who still test positive, 347 are in hospital, 99 in intensive care, and 41 in assisted breathing. The swabs carried out by Tunisia since the beginning of the epidemic are 238,671.

Due to the rapid spread of the virus, the authorities decreed the measure of the night curfew in the cities of Sousse, Monastir, and Sidi Bouzid for 15 days. According to the ministry, at least 450 medical and health personnel have already contracted the virus from the beginning of the pandemic.

j5jndn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/j5jndn/,3,Interesting read from Mark Manson on the origins of Radicalism :,"Psychologically  speaking, we‚Äôre social animals. Most of the meaning and purpose we  derive in life comes via our relationships with other individuals or from our perceived role within  society, at large. In fact, it appears that our need for human  connection is so strong that much of our ability to [form functional beliefs](https://markmanson.lt.emlnk1.com/Prod/link-tracker?redirectUrl=aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cucmVzZWFyY2hnYXRlLm5ldCUyRnB1YmxpY2F0aW9uJTJGMzM3Mjc1OTkwX1NvY2lhbGx5X0FkYXB0aXZlX0JlbGllZg==&amp;a=252489559&amp;account=markmanson%2Eactivehosted%2Ecom&amp;email=PpJfd06mLJexx2iRi0sioEzkASpiHornD%2Fz2wZTd1jg%3D&amp;s=288e81001f86968d8be22aa48a281dfe&amp;i=365A410A1A2593) about ourselves and the world is tied to our relationships. Like a muscle, you lose empathy if you don‚Äôt use it.   


And  this is why, when people look at what motivates religious fanatics,  conspiracy nuts, and political extremists, time and time again, what  they find is abiding loneliness. Rejection and social isolation  radicalize people. In the absence of affection and understanding, people  fall back onto delusional ideas of revolution and saving the world to  give themselves a sense of purpose.   


Hannah  Arendt, the mid-20th century philosopher and writer, was a German Jew  who successfully escaped the Nazis. After the war, she spent years  studying totalitarianism, the rise and fall of fascism, the communist revolutions, the horrors of  Stalin and Hitler and Mussolini and Mao‚Äîand more importantly, why these  leaders became so popular so quickly among their followers despite the  terror they invoked.   


She then produced a classic book called [*The Origins of Totalitarianism*](https://markmanson.lt.emlnk1.com/Prod/link-tracker?redirectUrl=aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbSUyRk9yaWdpbnMtVG90YWxpdGFyaWFuaXNtLUhhbm5haC1BcmVuZHQlMkZkcCUyRjAxNTY3MDE1Mzc=&amp;a=252489559&amp;account=markmanson%2Eactivehosted%2Ecom&amp;email=PpJfd06mLJexx2iRi0sioEzkASpiHornD%2Fz2wZTd1jg%3D&amp;s=288e81001f86968d8be22aa48a281dfe&amp;i=365A410A1A2594)*.* The  book stretches to nearly 500 pages in length and in the end, she comes  to a startling conclusion: she argued that loneliness makes people  susceptible to the contempt and fragmentation that causes functional  societies to collapse into extremism and violence.¬†   


I will quote her at length here and hope her progeny don‚Äôt sue me:   


‚ÄúLoneliness,  the common ground for terror, the essence of totalitarian government,  the preparation of its executioners and its victims, is closely  connected with up-rootedness and \[meaninglessness\] which have been the  curse of modern masses since the beginning of the industrial revolution  and have become acute with the rise of the imperialism at the end of the  last century and the breakdown of political institutions and social  traditions in our own time.   


\[...\]  


What  prepares men for totalitarian domination in the non-totalitarian world  is the fact that loneliness, once a borderline experience usually  suffered in certain marginal social conditions like old age, has become  an everyday experience of the ever-growing masses of our century. The  merciless process into which totalitarianism drives and organizes the  masses looks like a suicidal escape from this reality. \[The reasoning\]  which ‚Äúseizes you as in a vise‚Äù appears like a last support in a world where nobody is reliable and nothing can be relied upon. It is the inner  coercion whose only content is the strict avoidance of contradiction  that seems to confirm a man‚Äôs identity outside the relationships with  others.‚Äù    
Basically,  once cut off from empathetic social contact to ground us, the only way  we make sense of the world is by adopting radical all/nothing views. And  within these views, people begin to see a need for radical overthrow of  the status quo. They begin to imagine themselves complete victims or  destined saviors of society.   


Keep  in mind, too, that she wrote this in 1951, long before Trump and woke  leftists and Twitter were thought to have ruined everything.   


And  perhaps this is the real threat of social media: it does not necessarily make us  lonelier or angrier or more selfish or more spiteful ‚Äî it simply enables  the lonely and angry and selfish and spiteful to self-organize and be  heard like never before. It used to be that if you were a radical  Marxist who wished for violent revolution or if you were a quack who  thought Bill Gates was implanting microchips in millions of African  children, you kinda had to keep that shit to yourself. You'd cause a lot  of awkward silences and shifty side-glances until you‚Äôd realized you  weren‚Äôt being invited to kids‚Äô birthday parties anymore.   


So‚Ä¶  you‚Äôd shut the fuck up. And eventually, you‚Äôd start to realize, hey,  most people are all right. Things are going to be fine.   


But  now? There‚Äôs a forum somewhere full of people with the exact same  batshit crazy you have. And what do all humans who have similar yet  strange beliefs do when they get together? That‚Äôs right, they convince  themselves that they‚Äôre going to save the fucking world with their  knowledge. That is, they go on a crusade. And you and I and everyone  else has to listen to them, emboldened and invigorated by their new  internet ‚Äúfriends,‚Äù as they explain to us at Thanksgiving why Jesus was a  communist and the movie *Armageddon* was  really a coded message from QAnon explaining why Bruce Willis doesn‚Äôt  just run a pedophile ring, but he is secretly a sixteen-year-old boy  being held prisoner against his wishes, and...  


(Fuck, now I‚Äôm really going to get sued.)   


Anyway, where was I?   


Oh yeah! Loneliness‚Ä¶   


Perhaps another way to look at Arendt‚Äôs argument is that we run the risk of  extremists taking over when it becomes easier for radicals with fringe  beliefs to mobilize and organize than the moderate majority.  Historically, this mobilization of the extremes was enabled by economic  depressions and famines and (gulp) pandemics and whatnot. Today, perhaps  social media and smartphones have inadvertently made that mobilization  more possible.   


But who knows‚Ä¶ I could be wrong about all of this. The fact is, we still don‚Äôt know enough to say for sure.   


Until next week,

It would be a huge help:

1. If you know a certain bookstore that might have it (I've already looked it up in alkitab.tn, no luck :( )
2. If you have it and willing to sell it to me (I don't care about the status of the book as long it's not missing any of the pages)

Thank you.",,,,,,2020-10-05 20:44:09

jdk4mb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/jdk4mb/,2,What anarchists got wrong :,"To all Tunisians attracted by the Anarchist ideal of a stateless society : 

One of the leading figure of the Anarchist intellectual movement of the mid-19th century was the brilliant Russian scholar Peter Kropotkin who spent a significant amount of his life studying the social systems of tribal communities from the far and cold distant steppes of Siberia.

He noticed that despite the total absence of written laws, centralized power, police forces or institutions, the people of the steppes remained pacific in nature, always making truce and compromises through complex implicit cultural codes‚Ä¶without any intervention from the Tsarist state. And they were healthy, peaceful, productive and overall happy individuals (compared to the average Ruslan under Tsarist rule‚Ä¶). They were also completely independent and self-sufficient, produced their own food, clothing, medicine, etc.

What conclusion did Mr. Kropotkin draw from these observations?

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need a state, we don‚Äôt need organized religions, they are only mere tools to control the masses, yada yada.‚Äú

But he was mistaken.

The problem is, traditional clanic societies from the steppes are completely different from modern ‚Äúmassive‚Äù organizations. In clanic societies, everyone knows each other (max a few hundred acquaintances) and their survival and identities are completely dependent on the soil and terrain they are thriving on. They were also disseminated on large areas of lands unfit for agriculture (but perfect for oxen grazing), isolated from modern civilizations in quite hostile environment, with the lowest inhabitants concentration in the world.

But the majority of the people on this planet have long passed the stage of what Marxists have called ‚ÄúThe Asian Mode of Production‚Äù, or ‚ÄúHydraulic Civilization Stage‚Äù, when powerful central rulers managed to concentrate all the working forces in their hands via complex administrations maintained by this great technology of control originally designed to keep track of taxes : WRITING.

Since then, all the old tribal constructs and legacies have been destroyed and absorbed by the State apparatus, whose first ambition was to optimize and control the production and distribution of food.

The Egyptians were the first to reach that stage, when local tribe chieftains delegated their power to the Pharaoh, responsible for overseeing the massive construction operation needed to bring the Nile under control (constant floods were killing thousands every year). Then followed the Sumerians, then the Chinese, etc.

In these ‚Äúmasse society‚Äù, people can live among complete strangers without ‚Äúany‚Äù problem. In clanic societies this is simply impossible. Either you‚Äôre from the group, or you‚Äôre a stranger, a guest or an enemy.

Most of Africa has just recently discovered this system with colonization. Before, people were dispersed among tribes with very little contact with each other and would kill a stranger on sight if they could. In these systems, the ‚Äúforeigner‚Äù ‚Ä¶ is always an enemy, a monster, an animal, that one could kill, rape and even devore.

Tribes men can be the sweetest and most supportive people for their own kind‚Ä¶but not for strangers. Papoua New Guinea used to work this way 50 years ago, so we know a lot about it. Inside the clan, you could have a great life, but if you were stranded in the jungle, and met with two guys from another tribe and no family ties, you‚Äôd better run.

Also, new technologies cannot thrive in these type of societies as it requires insanely strong collaboration with many many people specializing in a specific field.

Masse modern society can be dehumanizing, and one could feel worthless and powerless in these big faceless administrative mastodonts where freedom is seriously limited‚Ä¶but it‚Äôs the most efficient system so far, and most Papuan agree with that.

So until we manage to change human nature through gene editing or brain implants that‚Äôll allow us to build strong loving empathetic bond with every single human beings out there, we‚Äôll still need a coercive state, we‚Äôll still need some form of religion, ideology, principle, dogma, or else to keep everything running tight, with all the negative and positive consequences.

Masse society cannot survive without power.

I‚Äôve already posted on r/TEFL but I thought it might be good to check here.

I‚Äôd like to know what life is like for expats in Tunisia, Tunis specifically. If there are any expats in this sub, how do you find it? 

To me it looks beautiful and the food looks amazing and Tunisian dialect sounds very interesting.

I am also interested in the experiences of women in Tunisia. There is a lot of conflicting experiences or information about women in Tunisia - even on this sub. So maybe it‚Äôll just be more contradictions, but I‚Äôd like to hear all of them.",,,,,,2020-10-22 01:36:11

jibzm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/jibzm8/,14,Please understand that mocking and disrespecting religions is part of French Culture.,"Honestly, compared to all the horrific caricatures of Jesus, the Pope, Priests and the Catholic Church circulating in satiric Parisian journals, the Charlie Hebdo caricatures of the Prophet are very very light, and not even remotely disrespectful for the common layman who isn't aware that any visual representation of Muhammad's face is forbidden.

Moreover, it is rarely specified if these ""caricatures"" represent the Prophet himself for that matter. To me, it always seemed like it was just some random Salafi or Muslim Brotherhood martyr more than anything.

**Why are French like this ?**

For most of its history, France had always been the slave of the Roman Empire and it's successor : the  Holy Roman Catholic Church, rendered extremely powerful by the influx of riches from the Americas.

Many times, some local rulers tried to overcome the status quo : the cathares, the calvinists, huguenots, enlightenment philosophers... religious civil wars have never been as fierce and traumatizing as in France. It almost destroyed and bankrupted the country. 

Protestantism was born as a way to escape the Church control...and the Spanish royal power in the process, which owned most of Europe. Spaniards were extremely violent and controlling, and knew how to use religion to justify mass genocide and enslavement of whole nations. 

The Nordic countries used Protestantism as a way to stand up for themselves and create a ruthless work ethic that would put Northern Europe at the forefront of economic and military superpowers ruling the game. The best place to study and do business today are still the old protestant countries. Old Catholic countries like France and Spain ? Not as much.

France was excluded from this cultural revolution because of the grip of the Church that relied on absolutism and nobility, not entrepreneurship and meritocracy. The French Revolution was an attempt to mimic their Northern neighbour system by suppressing the nobles' privileges...it didn't work out very well...

France had been the ground war of both progressivist and obscurantist forces for a very long time. Everything that might limit any type of freedom is now violently frowned upon, since people fought a long way to escape all kinds of tyrannies. This is why the Veil is such a sensitive issue in France, but only a trivial matter in the UK.

Since French are mostly ignorant and unaware of geopolitics and international tensions  (there is nothing more oblivious than the common prof de lyc√©e/coll√®ge in my humble opinion), they don't see any difference between mocking a very old power such as the Church, and ridiculing the religious figure of former stigmatized and oppressed working-middle-class people stuck in depressive HML, desperately looking for some common cultural ground to gain a sense of identity and value.

 Caricatures were first used in France to mock Marie-Antoinette and her sexual scandals. Then to mock Catholic priests and paedophilic scandals, etc. 

Mocking and caricaturing is an important part of the French struggle for more economic and political freedom, always harder to gain in old Roman's provinces. It is mostly an empowerment tool of poor and disarmed people, trying to fight oppression through satire. It is now spurring division among the ""de souche"" and Muslim-originated working class. 

In France, Islam is viewed as a manipulation tool of foreign powers like Qatar or Saudi Arabia, both by Leftists and Frontists. Most people who are afraid of Islam think the government is actually pushing an agenda  : to destroy France identity through mass immigration and cultural destruction. So to everyone who think Macron is trying to destroy Islam : his opponent believe the exact opposite.

TLDR : France has an extremely violent religious war history which drowned the country in blood. This is why La√Øcit√© and right to blasphemy is so important to the French, but not so much in Protestant countries who managed to conciliate religion and individual freedom. Understanding French history and culture is necessary to establish a peaceful and constructive dialogue.

Long story short, I passed all the tests ( including the navy one and the aviation one ) and I just got the confirmation that I'll be accepted in the navy. Training will most likely start next week.

Can anyone here who's in the navy academy shed some light on this subject ? I know quite a lot but more information never hurts. Couple specific questions I have though are about joining foreign military academies ( such as the royal academy ), what requirements are there to be give this opportuniuty, and how do I get to join the merchant navy, and are there many job opportunities if I did get accepted, and what's the monthly pay ? 

Also, are there navy special forces ? Can an officer join them ? And are they well treated ( in terms of food, house, good pay ) ? Is it the same as an enlisted soldier, or better than a normal officer?",,,,,,2020-10-27 13:21:01

Sure pure blooded amazigh people are rare in Tunisia but still many of us have more amazigh dna than arab. I feel like they fear if we identify as non arab that means we are drifting from identifying as muslims  but islam is a religion after all we can be amazigh muslims and the amazigh themselves have been adapting since the beginning with every religion concurred north Africa through out history even when they already had their own gods themselves, heck they still call them berbers when the Amazigh don't like that name its offensive as the Romans called them that to dehumanize them",,,,,,2020-10-27 14:48:16

It would be much appreciated if you could answer whatever you think you're knowledgeable of when it comes to banking based on your experience as a client.

Basically I would like to have an idea about the overall services banks (originally BIAT but whatever you think is helpful would do) provide for their clients, especially college students. So my questions are :

1\*Do i have to be employed in order to open a bank account ?

2\*What exactly are the packages BIAT offers (such as ""pack first"")? Are they privileges you add to your account after paying a subscription? If so , is that subscription permanent or do i have to renew it.

In case i open a BIAT bank account :

3\*Can i have both a debit card and credit card?

4\*What are the monthly/yearly fees that get deducted from my account?

5\*Do i have withdraw limitations , if yes what are they?

6\*Do they provide services that allow me to check my transactions , balance and account updates from sms or online?

7\*Will i be able to have an international card where i can make international purchases?

8\*Will foreign companies/clients be able to pay me by depositing money in my bank account in case i work as a freelancer?

9\*In case i want to deposit a large amount of money in my account do i have to justify it (e.g car sale) in order for it to get accepted?

10\*If i want to close my account will there be conditions to do so? If not does that mean i can withdraw my money and close my account whenever i want?

I'm well aware that some of these questions could be answered by customer service but I'd like to hear the cheesy details that a bank won't emphasize on until you're fucked in the arse.

Looking forward for your answers and mouled moubarak.",,,,,,2020-10-29 09:53:49

Recently a friend in the UK sent me few packs of different seeds (flowers, popcorn, ...) most of them are not available in Tunisia. 
The package weight is 200 gr but it was blocked in the post office. 

They said it's not authorized to bring seeds from another country unless you have special authorization. Unfortunately, I wasn't aware I asked the post before they said no problem.

At the end, they give me a paper with it I have fo go to the ministry of agriculture and show him the seeds origin (they didn't give me a sample) it's called 'phitosanitaire'

Do you have an idea about the procedure? Or is there other different processes of bringing seeds?",,,,,,2020-10-29 16:43:41

I‚Äôve ran into an issue however.

As in, can I actually visit them. 

I‚Äôm not really religious, but older religious sites are extremely beautiful to visit, so I‚Äôm really curious if this is something I can get to see! Of course if locals don‚Äôt want me to visit, I‚Äôd avoid doing this so I need to make sure.",,,,,,2020-10-29 21:00:39

However, that being said i'm currently facing a big problem due to the financial restrictions imposed by our government and wondering how i can actually collect my payouts and commissions being a Tunisian resident. 
Note that not all plateforms or sites pay through paypal many of them only pay through wiretranser.
I find this very frustrating and it's breaking me off. So please if any if you is facing the same situation and has found any way to get an international credit/debit card i would be more than grateful if you could give me a hint.

jn7vh6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/jn7vh6/,9,"Hi I just made a sub for all Tunisian social sciences students and graduates, if you are interested."," Here's the welcome post :

""This  sub is a platform primarily dedicated to Tunisian political/social/  science/law students and graduates (or simply interested in politics)   willing to share and discuss the current issues our country is facing,  and propose their personal outlook on the most critical questions.

Currently,  Social Sciences are seldom considered as purveyors of any practical  tools susceptible  to tackle and analyse the most urgent problems, like  water management, food production, or green transition.

But  ! These issues cannot be solved without the effective collaboration of  every actors of the state and civil society. Since Social Science helps  us to understand the society we live in, as it focuses on the  relationship between individuals and the political world, they are  critical in helping us designing better institutions, and thus, increase  collaboration to solve problems.

The  major social sciences are Anthropology, Archaeology, Economics,  Geography, History, Law, Linguistics, Politics, Psychology and  Sociology.

All these disciplines  are intertwined as they increases our knowledge of human nature and  aspirations within a specific group/society.

They are ESSENTIAL for understanding Tunisian society, and shape a better future for us all.

This  sub was created in reaction to the recent horrific terrorist attacks in  France, increasing tensions and hatred between communities and once  again labelling Tunisia as #1 provider of rogue lunatic ""fighters"".

The  more we understand ourselves and the people around us, the better we'll  be armed to fight this horrendous phenomenon that keeps alienating our country from the rest of the world.

Thank you for your participation !""

So i witnessed these sayings (as dumb as they sound) were mostly directed to younger adults in the election time where everyone suddenly become really knowledgeable and fanatic with their opinions about politics.

Maybe to encourage the youth? .. Still , what a disturbing way to do it right?

Anyways hearing this tickled my curiosity so without stretching this post, my questions are  :

&lt;&gt; Could your vote really be directed to one of the corrupted parties even if you did NOT vote ?(knowing that you're registered but decided to just not vote)

I had the chance last year as a part of my architecture degree to study abroad during my 3rd year at uni. Since I am from Quebec, a french speaking province of Canada, I thought that spending a semester in Tunisia would be an awesome cultural experience that I wouldn't have the chance to reproduce later in my life. 

To be honest, the first couple days were pretty tough, my friend and I didn't know much about the place and we weren't really prepared. The language barrier was worse than expected since we don't speak a proper european french in Quebec.

Luckily, the school staff and students were so welcoming, showing us around the city, and being overall really friendly. After a week, we already felt as a part of the group and it was a beautiful experience. We also had the chance to travel around a bit and spent a week on Djerba which was amazing.

Sadly we had to return home earlier because of Covid-19 but I keep very fond memories of Tunisia and its people. I believe it showed me the maghreb in a different light than how we usually perceive it in America.

I am a exchange student in tunisia right now. For myself, I consider myself as being religious. I am 21.

The people I've met here are mostly the complete opposite.

Also, everyone here does not like the ruling party. I have talked with some foreigners who are like me not from tunisia, but have been here for around 3 to 4 years and they have told me that the government actually does a quite good job, but the people do not co-operate at all.

The best example is the curfew and the shops closing. Come on, everyone does not care about the rules but afterwards yells at the government not managing the crisis good enough. I think this is completely bullshit. 

As for now, I would like to know why people here like nahda or do not like nahda. 

BUT PLEASE: be honest and do not joke around like yeah because we are tunisians or something bullshitty like that. Just give me straight up facts why the government is loved/hated. And don't tell me that people vote for them just because they are a religious party.

jpi726,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/jpi726/,37,Rant,"Ok everyone on this subreddit seems to either be a foreigner or doesn't actively live in Tunisia .
1.As an 18 years old tunisian, I don't think tunisian youth are becoming atheist by the day (which is neither a good nor a bad thing since we should respect each others religious identity)
However Nahdha and Religious Tunisians (not all of them)like to pick and choose from said religion using it to oppress woman or lgbtq community while still swearing littering drinking judging other people  and sexually harassing girls and sometimes boys which are behaviours frowned upon in said religion. I can't fathom how the way women dress or lgbtq's community existance can hurt ur religious beliefs . 
2. Since the french attacks redditors even in non political subbredits have shown signs of Islsmophobia .They talk about women oppressed in Muslim countries(which is true )but when a muslim woman tried to explain that while some are oppressed others choose to follow these rules by choice.In conclusion the west ""wants to free women in muslim countries from oppression""but  doesn't want to listen to said  women .Oppression comes in all forms whether forcing women to cover up or forcing women to take off their hijab.
3.This sub talks a lot  about our Amazhigs identity which I'm glad that I've known since I grew thinking we are arabs . An identity is really important to the person and identity eraser is  a form of genocide. But I think it's bit too late to try and recover this identity and thus we should create a new identity . Not as Amazhigs  neither as Arabs or french but as North africans and Tunisians.",,,,,,2020-11-07 01:49:27

jqwbrl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/jqwbrl/,18,Amid terror attacks France and Italy are planning to alert the Tunisia migrant vessels,"  

On Friday, The Italian minister, Luciana Lamorgese, and French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin held discussions in Rome. Italy and France are thinking about airplanes and boats to warn Tunisia to reverse the clandestine boats ferrying migrants north to the Italian coasts.

Tunisians are escaping their nations due to the coronavirus and its impacts on their economy. This year is the largest contingent of migrants that have been landing in Italy. These migrants are directly coming from Tunisia via boats into Italy. 

In past years, most of the transients arriving at Italy's southern shores originated from sub-Saharan Africa and traversed the Mediterranean in boats dispatched by traffickers in Libya. 

Darmanin refused to blame Italy for its treatment of the Tunisian migrants, who arrived on Italy's Lampedusa Island this Sept. They were isolated under pandemic guidelines and got expulsion papers from Italian officials before arriving in France in Oct.

I had never thought that there was something inadequate in how Italy dealt with the case, Darmanin stated, reacting to a question at a press meeting with Lamorgese after their discussions. Rather, he expressed gratitude toward Lamorgese and Italy's intelligence services for exchanging data after the Nice attack. 

Tunisia has been targeted many times by militant attacks and has paid a heavy price for battling against terror groups. Especially for picking the path to freedom and democracy, Darmanin added.

Lamorgese stated that during their discussion, they have decided to deploy maritime or air resources that could make the Tunisian officials aware of eventual departures and assist them with blocking the boats, and in their independence that we would prefer not to disregard, she added.

Under the arrangement, there would be giving an alert to the Tunisian officials to make it simpler to track the boats that depart from that region to go to the Italian coastline, Lamorgese stated.

Both the ministers met a day following French President Emmanuel Macron said that his nation is fortifying its border controls after recent terror attacks. 

French President Emmanuel Macron had comprehended Muslim outrage at the cartoons of the Muslim Prophet Muhammad, however, violence was inadmissible and he'd safeguard his country's freedom, he stated in an interview with Al Jazeera. Many Islamic nations have boycotted French goods in order to protest over the French President's statement on Charlie Hebdo magazine's controversial cartoons.

Tunisia is one of the nations that have a repatriation deal with Italy. However, with a huge number of Tunisians showing up via the sea route and about 100 expelled transients are returned to North African countries via air. 

However, importance has been given to check individuals that are believed to be a threat to the nation. There were no hints that the knife attacker in Nice, Ibrahim Issaoui, posed any such danger, Lamorgese added.

During Darmanin's whistle-stop Tunis meeting with ally Taoufik Charfeddine was focused on Tunisia's fight against terrorism and continuous migrant settlement.

On Friday, Tunisian civil rights organizations urged the European nations not to pressurize the Tunisian administration concerning the issue of irregular migrants and connecting it to terrorism.

jssg55,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/jssg55/,12,"UN organizes Libya talks in Tunisia, making way for lasting peace","UN opened peace talks between the warring factions of Libya. The talk was organised in the neighbouring Tunisia to prepare ground for fair and peaceful elections. For months UN has been trying to reach cease-fire agreement between the two opposing sides, one headed by warlord General Khalifa Haftar and other by Libyan Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj. UN finally succeeded in October when the rival forces agreed to the cease-fire agreement, which further allowed the country to resume its oil production and take necessary steps to move away from a decade of political deadlock.

In a video message, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres told Libyan delegates, ‚ÄúYou have gathered today to continue forging a new era of peace and stability for Libya. You have the opportunity to end a tragic conflict and create a future of dignity and hope‚Äù ‚ÄúNow it is your turn to shape the future of your country. Your commitment to this process will help restore Libyan sovereignty and the democratic legitimacy of Libyan institutions. As you engage in dialogue to resolve your differences, your determination will be tested,‚Äù he added.

The North African country has been a victim to years of conflict and civil war, which started with the downfall of long-time Libyan autocrat Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. The situation worsened with the emergence of war-like scenario between the rival groups, since the siege of the Libyan capital Tripoli which began in April last year.

The head of the UN mission in Libya, Stephanie Williams said the aim of the meeting was to make way for a peaceful government to lead the nation. The meeting, which was attended by 75 Libyan delegates, focused on creation of an executive body, which was ‚Äúcapable of organizing elections and implementing the political, economic and military reforms necessary to bring some normalcy back to Libyans‚Äô lives‚Äù. She said, ‚ÄúThe overriding aim of the National Political Programme is to renew political legitimacy by holding national elections, within an agreed timeframe‚Äù.

She added, ‚Äú‚ÄúEvery day cooperation is increasing, and the transformation of the 5+5 into the ‚Äògroup of 10‚Äô is more than just a slogan; it is a reality‚Ä¶ The new government will launch national reconciliation, combat corruption, and restore public services. Its progress will be monitored; its work will be reviewed on a regular basis by mechanisms that can hold it to account.‚Äù",,,,,,2020-11-12 10:33:13

WEBINAR   
""Le Patrimoine tunisien et les nouveaux usages num√©riques""  
La  Tunisie, pays dont l'histoire est tr√®s riche, a vu se succ√©der des  civilisations marquantes qui ont laiss√© des traces importantes aussi  bien au niveau du patrimoine mat√©riel qu‚Äôimmat√©riel.   
Malheureusement,  ce patrimoine important, nous disent les experts, est en p√©ril car  souvent mal conserv√©, et pas assez mis en valeur pour qu'il constitue un  vrai levier √©conomique pour le pays.   
Par  ailleurs, la Tunisie affiche son ambition de moderniser son  administration par l'outil num√©rique et la digitalisation de sa gestion.  Comment peut-on l'appliquer √† la conservation du Patrimoine Tunisien ?   
Plusieurs  programmes concernant le Patrimoine ont ainsi √©t√© √©labor√©s, dont le  projet d‚Äôinventaire num√©ris√© ""Virgil"". O√π en sommes nous aujourd‚Äôhui ?  Quelle est l'exp√©rience de la France dans ce domaine ?

***Par Sami Bibi -*** Dans  une interview accord√©e √† la chaine Attassia, l‚Äôartiste tunisienne Amel  Alouane a affirm√© avoir √©t√© harcel√©e et agress√©e verbalement par son  sup√©rieur hi√©rarchique √† la t√©l√©vision nationale tunisienne. Par  ailleurs, elle a d√©nonc√© une pratique (qui serait) courante en Tunisie,  en violation quotidienne de toutes les lois qui prot√®gent les femmes et  garantissent, dans une large mesure, l‚Äô√©galit√© entre les sexes.

Sur  la page FB de la m√™me chaine, les r√©actions des internautes ont √©t√©  tr√®s diverses. Plusieurs ont manifest√© un soutien inconditionnel √†  l‚Äôartiste et un rejet sans √©quivoque de la violence. Malheureusement,  d‚Äôautres, aussi nombreux, ont renvoy√© la responsabilit√© de cet acte  inf√¢me, criminalis√© par la loi tunisienne, √† l‚Äôartiste elle-m√™me... car  elle exag√®re, elle milite pour plus de libert√©s pour les femmes, elle  d√©fend certaines libert√©s mais pas toutes les libert√©s, elle ne  s‚Äôhabille pas d‚Äôune fa√ßon d√©cente, elle est contre la religion, etc. Un  internaute a m√™me utilis√© le verset S4-V34 pour justifier la violence  subie par Mme Alouane:

¬´ Les hommes  ont autorit√© sur les femmes, en raison des faveurs qu'Allah accorde √†  ceux-l√† sur celles-ci, et aussi √† cause des d√©penses qu'ils font de  leurs biens. Les femmes vertueuses sont ob√©issantes (√† leurs maris), et  prot√®gent ce qui doit √™tre prot√©g√©, pendant l'absence de leurs √©poux,  avec la protection d'Allah. Et quant √† celles dont vous craignez la  d√©sob√©issance, exhortez-les, √©loignez-vous d'elles dans leurs lits et  frappez-les. Si elles arrivent √† vous ob√©ir, alors ne cherchez plus de  voie contre elles, car Allah est certes, Haut et Grand ! ¬ª S4-V34

Les  violences faites aux femmes ne sont pas sp√©cifiques √† la soci√©t√©  tunisienne ou arabo-musulmane. M√™me dans les pays les plus progressistes  au monde, le chemin vers une soci√©t√© plus respectueuse de l‚Äôint√©grit√©  physique et morale des femmes continue √† √™tre parsem√© d‚Äôemb√ªches. Dans  les soci√©t√©s arabo-musulmanes, le plus grave est que cette violence  habite toujours la conscience de plusieurs de nos compatriotes (y  compris de sexe f√©minin) et elle a m√™me Dieu pour gardien; comme  l‚Äôinterpr√©tation quasi-unanime du verset S4-V34 le prouve.

Cet  usage de la religion pour justifier les violences √† l‚Äôencontre des  femmes m‚Äôa profond√©ment choqu√©. Apr√®s plus de 60 ans de la promulgation  du code du statut personnel, il est non seulement affligeant que nous  ayons encore √† en d√©battre, mais, en plus, il est le sombre t√©moin de  l‚Äôarcha√Øsme de la soci√©t√© arabo-musulmane la plus progressiste en  mati√®re de droits des femmes.

Et pourtant, tous les musulmans  s‚Äôaccordent √† dire que l‚Äôune des finalit√©s principales des versets  coraniques, apr√®s la croyance en un Dieu unique, est l‚Äô√©tablissement de  la justice entre les humains:

¬´ Nous  avons effectivement envoy√© Nos Messagers avec des preuves √©videntes, et  fait descendre avec eux le Livre et la balance, afin que les gens  √©tablissent la justice. ¬ª S57-V25.

On est donc en droit de  s‚Äôattendre √† ce que l‚Äôinterpr√©tation du verset S4-V34 soit coh√©rente  avec le message v√©hicul√© par verset S57-V25. Nous devons m√™me nous  attendre √† ce que tous nos textes sacr√©s doivent concourir √† l‚Äô√©l√©vation  de nos esprits et non √† ce qu‚Äôils participent √† la cons√©cration d‚Äôune  soci√©t√© misogyne et patriarcale. Enfin, comment serait-il possible de  justifier qu‚Äôun verset du Livre qui renferme la parole incr√©√©e de Dieu,  quand bien m√™me s‚Äôagirait-il d‚Äôun seul verset, autoriserait, voire m√™me  conseillerait √† un homme de frapper sa femme, et par extension une  femme, m√™me sous certaines conditions limit√©es!

Comme l‚Äôavait  bien recommand√© Averro√®s depuis le 12√®me si√®cle, le seul moyen de  pr√©server le caract√®re sacr√© et transcendant du Coran est de  r√©interpr√©ter continuellement ses textes √† la lumi√®res des √©volutions  scientifiques et soci√©tales. Comme nous allons le voir avec le verset  S4-V34, l‚Äôune des principales originalit√©s du Coran est qu‚Äôil s‚Äôy pr√™te  magnifiquement bien √† la r√©interpr√©tation de tous ses textes. Le Coran  est, en effet, un texte aphoristique. Il ne peut donc √™tre d√©chiffr√© du  seul fait qu‚Äôon le lise car son message ne doit pas √™tre  syst√©matiquement pris au premier degr√©. C‚Äôest alors que doit commencer  son interpr√©tation.

Il faut tout d‚Äôabord noter que le mot arabe ¬´  Al-Rijalou ¬ª ne d√©signe pas syst√©matiquement dans le Coran le genre  masculin. √Ä plusieurs endroits, ce mot d√©signe un groupe de personnes  (hommes et/ou femmes) de premier plan. Ces personnes sont des d√©cideurs,  des commandants, des professeurs, des dirigeants d‚Äôentreprise‚Ä¶ car,  selon le cas, elles sont les plus rus√©es (raison militaire),  comp√©tentes‚Ä¶ ou parce qu‚Äôelles sont propri√©taires du capital (chef  d‚Äôentreprise). Dans le cas du verset S4-V34, c‚Äôest la raison de la ¬´  Kawama ¬ª,¬† soit la responsabilit√© financi√®re de la famille, qui fait que  la personne (qu‚Äôelle soit un homme ou une femme) soit du nombre des ¬´  Rijals ¬ª.

Le mot ¬´ Al-Nissaa ¬ª ne d√©signe pas, non plus,  syst√©matiquement le genre f√©minin. Dans plusieurs versets, ce mot  d√©signe plut√¥t un groupe de personnes de second plan ou subalternes  (soldats, salari√©s, √©tudiants‚Ä¶).

Le mot ¬´ Kawamoun ¬ª d√©riv√© du  mot arabe ¬´ Kawama ¬ª signifie avoir une comp√©tence ou une richesse  financi√®re qui l√©gitime une position de premier plan ou la d√©tention  d‚Äôun pouvoir de d√©cision.   
  Dans la premi√®re phrase du verset  S4-V34, Dieu SWT nous parle d‚Äôune personne (homme ou femme)¬† qui dispose  du pouvoir de d√©cision dans son foyer car elle a la responsabilit√©¬† de  la charge financi√®re du couple (ou de la famille). Dans la seconde  partie de ce verset, Dieu SWT pr√©cise les r√®gles √† suivre si cette  responsabilit√© revient √† une femme.

L‚Äôusage du genre f√©minin √†  partir du mot ¬´ Al-Salihatou ¬ª¬† prouve qu‚Äôil d‚Äôagit d‚Äôune famille ayant  une femme comme principale (ou unique) soutien. Dans le contexte de ce  verset, ce mot ne signifie pas les pieuses mais, plut√¥t, les femmes qui  disposent l√©gitimement du pouvoir de d√©cision au sein de leur foyer car  elles sont les pourvoyeuses principales (ou uniques) de leur famille.

L‚Äôexpression  ¬´ Takhafouna Nouchouzahonna ¬ª indique le cas d‚Äôun homme qui craint un  comportement pr√©tentieux de la part de sa conjointe, ou m√™me un certain  m√©pris, eu √©gard √† sa position financi√®re dominante.

Le verbe ¬´  Dharaba ¬ª utilis√© √† la fin du verset est √©videment le plus  probl√©matique. Ce verbe peut bien signifier frapper physiquement.  Cependant, cette id√©e s‚Äôoppose √† plusieurs versets coraniques qui  pr√¥nent l‚Äô√©tablissement de la justice entre tous les humains (comme le  verset S57-V25, parmi tant d‚Äôautres) et l‚Äôobligation de respecter les  femmes. Comme plusieurs mots arabes, le verbe ¬´ Dharaba ¬ª est  polys√©mique et peut signifier, selon le contexte, √©lever, insinuer,  √©loigner, etc. Dans le cas du verset S4-V34, les islamologues [Al Ajami](https://www.alajami.fr/index.php/2018/09/06/s4-v34-35/) et [Mohamed Chahrour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM__deYR4e8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;fbclid=IwAR2yTQzgI7Wh3RYRRWY-Br-X3wVKYLleBI0HP6NFQq8m-us_pUMBX19HtmE)  retiennent la traduction √©loignez-vous d‚Äôelles ou quittez les.¬† Les  deux islamologues (et bien d‚Äôautres) justifient leur choix de traduction  pour des raisons de coh√©rence avec plusieurs autres versets coraniques  o√π ce verbe signifie bien quitter. Lorsqu‚Äôon dit, par exemple, ¬´ Dharaba  Al-Ardha ¬ª cela signifie que le sujet a quitt√© sa terre (ou sa ville).

D√®s lors, la bonne traduction du verset S4-V34 devient:

¬´  Les personnes du premier plan ont autorit√©/avantage sur les personnes  du second plan, en raison des faveurs que Dieu accorde aux premiers par  rapport aux seconds, et aussi en raison des charges (financi√®res) qui  leurs incombent. Les femmes qui ont l√©gitimement cette charge sont  ob√©issantes (√† leur mari), et prot√®gent ce qui doit √™tre prot√©g√©,  pendant l'absence de leur √©poux, avec la protection de Dieu. Et quant √†  celles dont vous craignez la pr√©tention, exhortez-les, √©loignez-vous  d'elles dans leur lit et quittez-les. Si elles arrivent √† vous ob√©ir,  alors ne cherchez plus d‚Äôalibis (injustifi√©s) contre elles, car Dieu est  certes, Haut et Grand! ¬ª

Pour conclure, quiconque utilise ce  verset pour justifier la moindre violence contre les femmes est dans son  tort. Il interpr√®te, consciemment ou inconsciemment, le message  coranique √† la lumi√®re de certaines traditions archa√Øques et non pas √†  la lumi√®re des valeurs universelles coh√©rentes avec la volont√© divine  d‚Äô√©tablir la justice entre les humains !

k0o17z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/k0o17z/,45,Blogger jailed in Tunisia for exposing MB extremist imam,"  

The Tunisian blogger Wajdi Mahouechi has been sentenced to two years in prison for posting a Facebook video deemed offensive by a Tunis court last week. Several human rights organizations, both locally and internationally, condemned the Tunis court decision, describing it as a clear limitation of freedom of expression.

Human Rights Watch reported on November 24 that Mahouechi, 31, as a frequent commentator on issues of public interest, posted a video early November on his Facebook page denouncing a Tunis public prosecutor‚Äôs failure to arrest and open an investigation against a local imam linked to the Muslim Brotherhood, who was justifying the assassination of people offending the Prophet Muhammad for Muslims. Prosecutors rather charged Mahouechi with ‚Äúaccusing officials of crimes without providing proof,‚Äù ‚Äúoffending others via telecommunications networks,‚Äù ‚Äúpublic calumny,‚Äù and ‚Äúinsulting an officer on duty.‚Äù The charges stem from the penal code as well as Tunisia‚Äôs 2001 telecommunications code, HRW reported.

‚ÄúTunisia‚Äôs legal codes are rife with vague laws that the authorities use to penalize free speech and silence critical voices,‚Äù Eric Goldstein, acting Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch affirmed, adding that Tunisia recognizes itself for encouraging free speech since its 2011 uprising, but is retreating on preserving that liberty. The imam‚Äôs video after the October 16, 2020 beheading of Samuel Paty, a teacher in Paris, by a Chechen exile after Paty displayed cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad to his students during a lesson on right of expression. 

In his Facebook post, Mahouechi criticized the prosecutor for not examining a 2019 accusation that he had filed against police who allegedly had beaten him. Mahouechi used speech that might be viewed as vulgar but said he was mocking only this authority and not the whole judicial apparatus of Tunisia. Sheriffs from the Hay El Khadra Unit for Combatting Terrorism and Organized Crime caught Mahouechi on November 2 and questioned him for at least four hours in the presence of his attorney, Mohamed Ali Bouchiba. The lawyer is the co-founder of Bloggers Without Borders, a body constituted by volunteer lawyers to aid social media activists and others prosecuted for their ideas and scripts.

Bouchiba told HRW that police officers had come to the Mahouechi‚Äôs family house late at night watching for him. ‚ÄúWe knew he would be arrested,‚Äù stated Bouchiba, adding that the police caught him just one day after his post on the social network. Bouchiba affirmed that Mahouechi told authorities that he was not accusing anyone in his video and only reacted as a whistleblower to the imam‚Äôs video for the single objective of exposing radical beliefs and terrorism.

The Tunis First Instance Court condemned Mahouehchi of ‚Äúaccusing public officials of crimes related to their jobs without furnishing proof,‚Äù culpable by up to two years in jail under article 128 of the Tunisian penal code, harming or disturbing others via public telecommunications networks under Art. 86 of the telecommunications code, which stipulates a sentence of up to two years in prison and a fine up to 1,000 Tunisian dinars (around US$300). Public calumny, under article 245 of penal code; and ‚Äúinsulting a public officer during the performance of their duties,‚Äù punishable by up to one year in prison under Article 125.

According to HRW and Bloggers Without Borders Tunisia is seeing an increase in prosecutions that remind of the arrests and trials of writers and activists in 2017. ‚ÄúThe prosecutions never stopped really. They just slowed down and now they‚Äôre back.‚Äù The lawyer said speaking with HRW. Two reports issued by the international organization, in January and October 2019, revealed the prosecutions of bloggers and social media activists in Tunisia for their peaceful online commentary. In these pursuits, authorities made application of laws on criminal defamation, ‚Äúspreading false information,‚Äù and ‚Äúharm of others through telecommunications networks‚Äù to sue people who post on social media about politics, expose corruption, or criticize authorities and decision-makers.

Since 2017, Tunisian yards have condemned six social media operators to prison for sharing their critical views. The two-year punishment against Mahouechi is the hardest so far toward a blogger for online criticism. Mahouechi is completing his penalty in Tunis‚Äôs Mornaguia prison. His lawyers will contest the judgment. ‚ÄúTunisia has no excuse to prosecute peaceful critics and intimidate bloggers who attack state authorities,‚Äù Goldstein said. ‚ÄúParliament should move quickly to amend or delete laws that are relics of the ousted autocratic regime.‚Äù

k3y58b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/k3y58b/,2,La Poste,"Hey guys,

I've ordered stuff from the UK and China before. I managed to get a refund from eBay after the item didn't arrive for 3 months and thought nothing of it until I got buzzed downstairs in my residence (in the middle of nowhere) with the post guy handing me my two video games (actually, FIFA 18 that I purchased for less than ¬£10 just to see how the post works came first and then two or three days later, a cracked-from-the-pressure-but-sealed Mass Effect 3 for Xbox 360).

Whenever I tried to call the post man back, he'd never pick up my calls so finding out from the local post office (in La Marsa) if any post has arrived for me is impossible.

Then I ordered some SD2Vita adapters for my two PlayStation Vitas - neither came (this was before the lockdown), and then I had the reseller resend another 2 (for free).

I then ordered my wife some lipstick for $2 and it came after a month. Then a few days later another lipstick came. She lives in Ben Arous and doesn't have the number of her local post man.

Now I live somewhere else (in the state of Tunis) and I am waiting for a new bank card (urgently needed, how else will I get money if my current one expires) and a few electronics (USB HDMI capture stick, HDMI splitter, screwdrivers) from China... how long does it take, what tips can you give me to make sure that the post arrives (I put my apartment name, floor, block, road, city name, street, post code and phone number on all packages) and who can I call to check if something has arrived?

If the customs decide that I owe taxes on the cables or USB stick, how can I know that they're being held?

Thanks,

SH",,,,,,2020-11-30 15:40:45

A friend and I are trying to shoot a documentary on pen pals. We are trying to find pen pals from all over the world. All different countries, religions, walks of life. We want to meet people with all kinds of life experiences. We are looking for ***snail mail - written letters sent through post***. I understand some places in the world this is extremely time consuming and maybe not even possible due to the postal situation but we are willing to make this a long process for the sake of story so there are no time constraints.

We will be looking to enter the film into film festivals depending on the final format will depend on where this is shown in the end.

**What we are looking for -**

Preferably someone with a great story that is willing to exchange written and mailed letters back and forth for an extended period of time.

* There is no time frame or amount of letters you have to write - whatever you feel like
* There is no topic off limit
* You can be as vague or detailed about your personal life as you like

Someone willing to take part in some form of video correspondence as well ***(not a deal breaker)***

**What we will not do -**

Share any kind of personal information like full name or address in the film. We will only share first name and country of origin

Share any information you do not wish for us to share - (I.E. - If there is a topic in your letter you don't want us to reveal just let us know)

***I want to be completely open and transparent as possible so if you have any questions definitely ask!***

We will give each participant a viewing of their segment to sign off on that you are comfortable with what we say and show.

If this is something you feel like you would be interested in please feel free to PM me or start a reddit chat and I can answer any more questions you have or give you an address to start!

Thank you for reading this and look forward to hearing from you!",,,,,,2020-12-01 15:13:52

A foreign friend of mine wanted to watch Choufli Hal but couldn't understand Tunisian.  So I thought about making Choufli Hal subtitles both in TUNISIAN and ENGLISH  ( I know that some Tunisian references cannot be correctly translated but it is an opportunity for non-Tunisians to introduce them to our culture.

I started making Tunisian subtitles for the first ep season 1. However, it takes so long ( Sooo long). I think there are over 150 episodes. I can't do this alone. I need some help.

I can only ask for help from you. This is the only Tunisian community I know. This is not only for non-Tunisians but also for the deaf community in Tunisia. (And those who eat while watching :p)

If you want to help, PM me. I'll explain in more detail.

Let me know if such a thing already exists.

Thank you

My French and English are somewhat good.
On the Other hand, in Arab I can just count to 10.
And also is there some inconvenient un that?

Edit:
Thank you for your feedback, my native language is French. I learned English at school and Arabic from local veggies sellers.  I already have dual (African) nationality and this has already proven to be very useful (literally saving my life once).
  But I remember that since I have Tunisian visas in my passport I spend a lot more time at airport controls in Europe lol...Anyway. 
I tell myself that if it is possible why not if it can save me money and prevent some people from no longer see me as a stranger full of money to distribute.

-To be an adult.
-To master a minimum of the Arabic language. But no criteria specifying what this ""minimum"" is, left to the appreciation of the administration. Condition removed for spouses of Tunisian women
-Be sane (ouch)
-Not to constitute a burden or a danger for the national community, that is to say: good life and morals, not to have been condemned for serious acts. This condition can be waived if the conviction took place abroad.",,,,,,2020-12-12 19:38:09

This is the ambition of most Tunisian people, and if someone thinks differently or even suggests a theoretical project/startup idea, he will be advised not to ""dream too much"" and to be more ""logical"", and to most people being logical means joining the rat race, what's surprising is that most people seem to be perfectly fine with this kind of lifestyle.

Older generations can't be blamed since they have been brainwashed to be kept blind average citizens who serve as cogs to keep the big machine going without asking unnecessary questions and believing that's how life is supposed to be for everyone, it's difficult to convince these people but it really hurts to see newer generations embracing this dead end lifestyle instead of trying to innovate or to do something different especially now that technology opened up a lot of opportunities.

In my opinion, the goverment wants people to stay at the bottom of the food chain, that's why they engrave the idea that finding a low to average paying job is considered an ""opportunity"" in peoples' minds and therefore the majority get the illusion of achieving something when they get accepted into an administrative position, especially when they think about the fact that they will get paid even if they are being lazy on the job. What's your opinion about this subject?

*PS: I understand that some people have a tough financial situation and some are forced to work jobs they don't like (with all due respect to all jobs) in order tu support themselves and their families. I also understand that some people just want to work for the money, without really caring about the job itself.*",,,,,,2020-12-13 00:50:16

kcf8tx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/kcf8tx/,10,Necessity of the university degree on the job market,"Following a formal university program is the most efficient way of gaining knowledge in the field in question, there are some fields such as medical and law studies that **require** going to university to gain profound knowledge and be qualified to work as a doctor or a lawyer.

Some fields such as tech do not require someone to go through a university program in order to be a programmer, there are lots of online ressources and books where you can learn how to program in different languages on your own pace, while going through a university or bootcamp program will give you  stronger computer science foundations, it still is not proof that the degree holder is qualified to work as a software engineer. 

Look at it this way: 

1. **PERSON A: Went through a software engineering program in university:** This person applied for a front-end web developer position, showed his degree, a few internships and some school projects.
2. **PERSON B: Self-taught web developer:** This person applied for the same front-end web developer position that PERSON A applied to, however, this person only showed a portfolio of previous real world experience such as projects he created for clients or personal apps, but no degree.

As an employer, would you hire PERSON A or PERSON B?

Most employers will consider PERSON A's degree as proof of being qualified and consider him advantaged over PERSON B, while PERSON B's will power to self-learn and portfolio of real life client work should be considered as proof that the person loves software engineering and is serious about developing a career in that field.

Some companies may hire candidates with weaker degrees (Bootcamp certification/BTP/BTS/) or no degrees at all in order to underpay them for their work, which is basically slavery.

In my opinion, Tunisian companies (or foreign companies who still consider the degree as proof of qualification) should be inspired by big tech companies such as Google and Apple [who no longer require candidates to have university degrees to apply](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/16/15-companies-that-no-longer-require-employees-to-have-a-college-degree.html) and instead implement a universal hiring process for everyone, that consists of a technical interview and whiteboard questions that demonstrate the candidate's algorithmic problem solving skills and decide if the person will be a good addition to the company. Even if university graduates may still have an edge in solving algorithm problems, this will give candidates with no degrees an equal chance since everyone will be hired based on a universal test and paid equally. 

I chose the tech industry only as an example for the purpose of this topic,  there are lots of other fields that do not require a university degree to get a job as long as you put in the necessary effort and self-discipline to learn on your own.",,,,,,2020-12-13 18:02:45

khl8cl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/khl8cl/,21,"Friends of Tunisia, help me propose?"," 

Hi folks,

I'm requesting help from someone within your country to help me propose to my girlfriend. In February this year, I decided that I want to make the proposal as amazing as possible for her as I would hope, it will be a once in a lifetime event for her. I planned from February until June, which is our anniversary, then I started a 365-day countdown to our next anniversary.

In short, I'm getting a photo of a person (or people) from **every single country in the world** (plus a whole bunch of territories), to take a photo of themselves holding a piece of paper that has some specific writing on it. The paper will have 3 things on it, **a specific word, the date, and the country.** Each countries word and date are different so it's being done in alphabetical order, when added altogether, all the words will make a letter, which will end in me proposing to her.

I understand this isn't everyone's kind of thing, chirp away if you must, I can take it, but Reddit has been by far my best place to find people from all over the world (check my post history) and I know there are people everywhere that love this kind of thing too. So far I've been able to get around 190+ countries' photos, now I'm here asking for help from your country.

**To reiterate, all I would need is a photo of you (with friends/family if you like) taking a photo with a piece of paper that has some specific writing on it. You don't need to be from the country, just be in it when the photo is taken.** I can't offer much other than my many, many thanks and the promise that if you're ever in need of a favor, I will do my best to help.

I'd be more than happy to prove this is real with examples, but if you check my post history, you can probably tell it is real. Obviously, as I don't want my girlfriend to find out, I am not posting on my actual account. Also, I know a few of you eagle-eyed folk on here have noticed that 365 days is too many days for the number of countries, I have 223 countries on my list, the remaining 23 days are photos taken in specific locations that hold a significant memory for our relationship.

If you're not in this country, you can see the countries I need (soon or in the future) here; [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iqlbMf3s4KbA9sz4DyRpQn8CiczmY2vvwPQ7HsaTafY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iqlbMf3s4KbA9sz4DyRpQn8CiczmY2vvwPQ7HsaTafY/edit?usp=sharing)

*Please note; by agreeing to send me a photo, you're happy for it to be posted online - each photo will only be in the video for a brief second.*

***If interested either let me know in here or send me a DM - if you do send me a DM it would be great if you post in here too just so I don't miss it (Reddit sometimes doesn't notify me for DM's)***",,,,,,2020-12-21 16:57:53

kkquu4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/kkquu4/,3,"Request for legal help, regarding marriage to a Tunisian woman","Hey guys,

I have a question for you. One does not need to be a lawyer to know the answer to this question, it's mostly for Tunisians married to foreigners:

I would like to get officially married by means of a ""double proxy marriage"" - this is when I and my future (legal) wife give permission to someone, in another country, to act on our behalf to perform a specific task: perform a marriage between us, without our presence under the laws of that country (meaning, our marriage license will be issued by the government of that country, as if we were standing before a notary in a biladeya, like in Tunisia, but not in this case, and will have an apostille and will need to be translated into Arabic but will be completely legally valid in Tunisia thereafter)

I do not want to get married according to Tunisian law and the jurisdiction that I have chosen has favourable conditions for both parties, should we ever decide to separate.

I need to provide them with one document that I do not know how to obtain: a **certificate of no impediment to marriage** \- how can my lady get such a document in Tunisia? Is it available only from Tunisian consulates, or can one get it from within Tunisia? How much does it cost?

Where, and for how much money, does one get a Tunisian document notarised? (we need an apostile stamp on the certificate of no impediment to marriage). I know that it is the job of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but what is the address of the building at which we can get an apostille stamp. Can we just show up or is it by appointment only? Can we pay extra and get it done quicker/delivery service?

I need to get a Tunisian notary to put his seal on a document which gives permission for the people acting on our behalf abroad to conduct our marriage - preferably written in Spanish. If not, then in French. Can a notary in Tunisia give me such a document? Again, how much would it cost?

And finally... assuming I can avoid the whole headache of providing Tunisian documents and procure a marriage certificate: let us assume I have this foreign marriage certificate in my hands with an apostille stamp on it and a translation from an authorised translator within Tunisia, **how do I add my family name to my wife's ID card/passport and birth certificate? To which government department should I submit a copy of our marriage certificate and how long does the process take, from me submitting the documents to her having a new set of documents mentioning our marriage?**

I thank everyone who has taken the time to respond to my questions,

Your favourite neighbourhood hunter.",,,,,,2020-12-26 21:58:55

So I have started to hear stuff about phones getting some kind of new security method that shuts down the phone or something when it's being used by a new owner as a way to combat brakajet and make sure that the thief won't be able to sell the stolen phone.

I apologize if my question doesn't make sense it's just I didn't pay attention to the news lately and recently I received a message called ""Sajalni"" that only told me to register my phone by entering some code to protect it.

But if this is true that we can't sell or buy used phones anymore then this is absolutely the worst idea I ever heard about because not everyone, in fact most of the people in most of the time aren't able to afford a new good quality phone with respectable specs so most of us have to buy used phones at one point of our lives or how about what if one day I decided to gift my phone to a friend or cousin but he can't use it because he is the first owner so yeah this idea is going to be horrible if it's true.

If it isn't true then I'm relieved lol.

I  need words and sentences that are incomprehensible for Arabic speakers  in the Middle East. As you know Darija and Derja from Morocco, Algeria  and Tunisia are hard to understand for those from the Near East. The sentences and words I need can be random or from your own experience, when you talked to someone from the Middle East.

I had an  conversation with a Lebanese friend of mine, who sometimes talks to me  in Lebanese Arabic and he asked me if I have cats. I replied with  ""Ma3andish shi mush."" (""I don't have any cats"") and he couldn't understand anything.",,,,,,2020-12-31 16:49:12
