Their lives are boring because of many reasons which may include :

* 35% of the population is illiterate 

* Most of the population did not have a proper sex Ed or something close to that, so sexual repression is very apparent 

* No sense of independence because of economy and culture :

    Living with your family until marriage makes them a part of your daily life and makes you unable to be truly be free and try out things especially if you have strict religious parents who monitor your time and friends etc

    Shitty economy, bad renting culture because most landlords only rent to families or a group of students and there is no part-time culture that gives you enough wages to afford rent, it can be done, but it's way easier to live off your parents

Bad education plays a huge role in all of the points listed above.",2017-04-06 22:03:37

depending on your time of arrival you have many options : 

* A louage (shared taxi)

* A private transfer service (&gt;100$€£)
* Train from Barcelona station (very economic &lt;15$€£), you'd need to take a taxi from the airport to the station (beware of overpriced airport taxis, always demand to put the meter)

* Hire a car if you are not scared to drive on the tunisian roads (joke). this can be expensive

dkp3m9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/6peqao/,5,"Most Arabic varieties are understandable to Tunisians even though they may be very different. This is due to the continuous cultural exchange (mainly through the media) which simplifies mutual intelligibility. However people who aren't exposed to other Arabic varieties (like foreign-born Tunisians or people who simply don't consume media from other Arab countries) may find most foreign varieties difficult to understand.

Maltese in particular would be rather easily understood to a Tunisian in its written form (many Tunisians are familiar with Italian as well). Spoken Maltese needs getting used to due to the decidedly ""latinized"" intonation. But I believe it's easier for a Tunisian to understand Maltese than the other way round.

Regarding your questions: 

1) Tunis is as safe as in any other capital. That British warning is sincerely bullshit. I suppose it was issued due to the terrorist Attacks on Bardo and Sousse and never reversed. Just beware of tourist traps and potential pickpockets and you should be fine. Carry a photocopy of your passport just in case as some places are still protected by the police/military and they may ask you for id.

2) Malta is well known as a country, if poorly understood nowadays (There was a sizable maltese community in Tunisia during the French protectorate well into the 20th century). People working in the tourism industry in particular will greet you with ""Malta hanina, khobz (ħobż) u sardina"" as soon as they learn you're Maltese. That expression actually originated with the Maltese who used to live here.

3) you should be fine using English or French. Heck, when in doubt throw in some maltese and see if it sticks. No big problems there :)

They could either have an uneasy peace by dividing the south(and the Iberian peninsula) and north med sea, constant warfare like the persian and roman wars or Carthage could have won. Each scenario leads to varying possibilities. 


Without the defeat of the great maritime empire of Carthage, rome might not become an empire at all. The alliance between the latins and greeks might have crumbled. The eastern possession might still be under greek rulers after the conquests of Alexander but with more local influence. Istanbul would still be a small fishing village. Christianity would have a completely different context without roman rule and wouldn't have gotten the state support it needed to expand into europe. 



Who gets egypt is a big deal in this alternate timeline. Egypt is wealthy and played a major role in the early theology of Christianity (like the eastern maghreb). The Persians would probably rule the ME without eastern roman pushback. 


New powers would emerge and undermine both of these powers. Rome could have easily been swallowed up by the neighboring latins. Paganism would surely rule the European continent. 


Without such antagonistic Orthodox rule in the ME, the early arab conquest would have completely different geopolitical situation. It probably would expand solely on persian territories if the other regions of the ME and north africa react differently to the emergent new power.

1st of All, 

What are you looking for exactly ? no offense but I tried starting business with ""ambitious people"" before who are only fueled by their motivation and we failed terribly, not because motivation is bad, but because no matter how bad you want something to happen, if you suck at it, then you're gonna suck at it. plain and simple.  
 

So, 

What are you looking for exactly ? 

I have a game development company and work with a partnership with an Australian company, I know a good number of programmers and artists/graphic designers and even Musicians, Am also a programmer but I really hate business-oriented coding, so I prefer to just stick to developing game prototype and then hire a programmer to finish up the job, And Also of course I can help by investing in this project, but why will I do that ?

The only thing that have been buzzing in my head when I was reading your post is that our finance law sucks and the central bank is run by old school retards, so how do you expect that such a project will be accepted here ? And honestly I don't think any government will like to have a crypto currency in its system right ? 

Finally, say everything went well, what are the problem that your system is going to solve ?

As far as i know the only major issue we have in the county is international transactions for the common people 

* Gamers want to buy steam/psn games.

* شبابنا العاطل عالعمل wants to become a millionaire by betting on football games.

* from time to time someone needs to buy a ~10$ things that only exists in eBay or AliBaba.

These issues are tough to be solved for most people because they just can't pay Internationally.

There is other problems such as the bullshit $3000/year that doesn't make any sense lol

but yeah, these are the problems that I really want them to be solved.

PS : 

Your title says ""hiring"", but the text kinda suggests that currently you are not able to pay, Personally I don't mind that because if i ever joined you then am not gonna join as a programmer so there wont be any ""tough time"" spent for free, but If am going to suggest this to my developers friends, then I don't think any of them will interested in the ""*free exchange of ideas*"" ",2017-04-20 18:33:09

They won first place in 2014 elections after being outsiders in 2012 and hated by almost every political party because they were seen as a resurengence of the old regime. They made a deal with ennahda and eventually had a coalition government.




Jabha sha'bia=popular front, a coalition of small leftist parties with differing strains of communism and overtones of arab nationalism, the type of arab nationalism that supports asad for example. They get a small percentage of the votes.


Free patriotic union lead by slim riahi, a businessman. Participated in a coalition government with nida and ennahda and then left. Now he's part of the new incarnation of ""jabhat al-inkadh""= The rescue front (?)  with mohsen marzouk.





Mashrou' tounis=tunisia's project (?) is a splinter group from nidaa tounis. They broke off from that party because they see the coalition with ennahda as a mistake, they see ennahda as terrorists, they might be called extreme secularists. They also say that the break off happened because of mismanagement in the party and nepotism in favor of hafidh the son of beji kaid essebsi. This party hasn't gone into elections yet but might be a strong contendor because they claim to uphold the true values of nidaa so they might eventually take all their constituents. Hasn't happened yet. nidaa is still high in the polls, neck and neck with ennahda. Marzouk has created the new iteration of the rescue front and gathered new friends mainly from small parties to counter islamism aka ennahda.




there is also tounis al-irada= tunisia the will (?) created by former president moncef marzouki (lost to beji kaid essebsi in the presidential elections in the second round by 44%-55%). He tried to absorb his earlier fragmented party. Not sure if he succeeded. He might be a strong contendor for presidential elections but not parliamentary ones due to his weak party. Personally he might win because he's seen as an honest man who isn't corrupt. I think fresher faces would come up by then. 




There is also attayar al-dimocrati=the democratic current. lead by the abbou couple, they don't have much parliamentary representation or any chances of forming majority governments on their own at least for the next couple of elections. The couple has a strong personal following based on their public statements against corruption and actually unveiling some of that corruption themselves. They're both lawyers. The husband spent time in jail and I think mandala intervened on his behalf to the old regime. They were part of the former president's party but then broke off.




I think these are the main parties and political personalities that may have a hand in current and future governments. Civil society does also play huge role in politics even if they shouldn't at times. Some of the prominent ones are UGTT, Tunisian human rights league, UTICA, Tunisian order of lawyers...

One thing to keep in mind is when you're in a shop that is in a tourist area, you are paying tourist prices for things.  Always negotiate prices.  Sousse is pretty well known for beaches.  You can go paragliding, you can go snorkeling as well.  Your hotel will have more information on where you can go and do these things.    Also, I would suggest going to Hard Rock Cafe for some live music as they have bands there on weekends that are really good and a dance floor.

However, most people are just drawn to Sousse for the beaches so that's where you're going to find most of the attractions.  

However, here are some things you can check out:

[Museum Dar Essid](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/tunisia/sousse/attractions/museum-dar-essid/a/poi-sig/440276/355683)

Also, hotels usually have animation teams which is a show or something going on that are pretty interesting.

There is still a lot of unemployment and a lot of things that need improvement but the government seems to just be neglecting it.  They seem to have things that are stable and are happy with just riding the cruise control for now.

For example, infrastructure here is a mess.  From the roads to electrical grid to internet to water, you name it.  However, their biggest concern recently, was tearing down cafe storefronts that were blocking sidewalks.  Something they've allowed for YEARS and suddenly deemed were a nuisance and tore them down at 3am one night.

On top of that, they tore them down, making most of the cafes close up for months now to rebuild and they never bothered to clean it up.  They left it there.  Lac 2 is a very nice area and looks better than most places but it looked like bombs went off with rubble everywhere.  Their intention was to improve the area but it made it look far worse.  Now, quite a few cafes have rebuild and put their cafes back on the sidewalks with a little less permanent structures but they're still blocking sidewalks (Looking at you Omega Cafe) and they'll let them continue blocking it.

There seemed to be ZERO point in what they did and the focus needs to be on more pressing concerns but there is nothing being done towards the bigger issues.  All that said, they are trying to do what they can in areas that have heavy tourism and they are trying to beef up security (thanks to the US and Germans) and are doing an okay job at it.",2017-02-03 13:27:43

dgpzmib,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/67b9v8/,3,"You can always look up the exchange rate but it actually just took a big dip it went from 1USD = 2.3TND to 2.5 in one day.  They are devaluing the currency on purpose due to some IMF recommendations that are less recommendations and more ""We gave you a loan, so, do it it now or else"" and to avoid a bigger crash.  My suggestion is to wait until the last minute because it's probably going to get close to 1USD to 2.7TND.  

Others say avoid the airport but you can check the exchange rate online before doing it and there are numerous banks at the airport with rates up on a board so you can pick the best one and it's a lot easier than trying to search out a bank itself to do it.

Also, I'd suggest only converting when you need to convert.  Contact your bank and see about international ATM withdraws.  I have PNC and I get 4 free a month because I have a higher than basic/free account and I only take it out when needed because, again, the TND is dropping in value against the USD so instead of converting from US Cash to TND, you can just withdraw from an ATM.

Again, double check with your bank to make sure you can do that.  If so, that's your best bet.

dh18bw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/68sekb/,3,"hey, 

1) The dinar has to drop in value at some point in order to be more competitive (exports, foreign investments and so on). The problem is that it is set to drop way too much. The central bank has to intervene but also the government in general. They've done nothing tangible yet in fighting the informal economy and the anarchical imports. These are structural problems in Tunisia: smuggling, informal economy and corruption. 

2) The finance minister's comments were unfortunate but the PM had the right to sack her. The government has to speak with a single voice and has to be coherent. 

3) The tunisian security forces are the only reason I'm somewhat optimistic about the future of the country. They gained some experience in fighting terrorism and I hope they get support (intel, gear, etc) in order to be even more efficient. The only sure thing that Tunisia has built is a republican army which has no political agenda. I wish that the governement could get this message to Washington and the other global powers. The TN army needs weapons and training and it won't buy them in order the threaten the local or the regional peace.

All that money could be put into education, infastructure, all sorts of things.  It could probably double the current income from tourism in the first year alone.

&gt; turn your freelancing business into a software company which for a technology company shouldn't require a huge investment.

I have few friends who work in these company and according to them what you really need is a good contact list to acquire clients, and for it to work locally (in Tunisia) I don't think internet ""farming"" will do me any good, as a Freelancer i can find job very easily online with foreign clients, but i have no idea where and how to start doing that locally.

df6os8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/5ugwes/,2,"&gt; Can you learn both without them overlapping? If yes, how?

I don't know people that did that at least. The most common route people take is to start learning fusha to a certain level. Knowing even only the basics will help a lot, because it will basically make learning tunisian a lesson in vocabulary.

&gt; Also, where is the best place for two elderly pensioners to retire? 

Assuming you don't decide to buy a house in a ""bad"" neighborhood, you can find most north-east/east coastal cities enjoyable (the capital, Bizerte, Nabeul, Sousse, Monastir...). I would advise you to visit them as a tourist first and then decide on your own. If I had to choose one it would be Tunis (La Marsa, Berges du Lac, Menzah 5-6-7, Riadh el Andalous....)

&gt; Are there people who will try and do dawah to them, because they aren't from a Muslim country?

No, I never saw foreigners say this happened to them. The kind of people that would do that aren't interested in them anyway.

&gt; Will they be scammed?

Tunisians are mostly kind to foreigners, however some of them may try to scam them. These are minor cases though, like merchants trying to sell for a price bigger than normal (they assume you aren't used to them) or taxi drivers trying to hide the timer (happens often when you take one from the airport).

So you use it when you want to speak about the weight of something. 



For example you can say I want rtal tomatoes but you can't say I want shtar tomatoes because you haven't specified a half of what. A correct sentence would be I want shtar kilo tomatoes.

I joke, this was actually planned and was based off ""suggestions"" by the IMF and in the short term, sucks because that means inflation and that means prices going up and prices go up before salaries increase to match.  However, the currency has been over valued for quite a while.  I know that 3 years ago it was 1USD = 1.5TND and now it's 2.5TND and the real value has always been cloesr to 3 TND so you can expect it to get to 3 most likely over the course of this year.

In the long term, this ISN'T a bad thing though because it helps to fight hyperinflation which is the REALLY bad thing.  Greece has started to pull itself out of a hole by devaluing the currency on orders from the IMF (This is what happens when you don't heed their ""suggestions"" when you have a loan through them, which Tunisia does).",2017-04-25 09:48:06

I mean your examples are flawed at their base, ***before I say any more; once again I agree with you***, you mention that Americans are xenophobic and the French are pushy, and Germans ignore you when you don't speak their Language. Some of that is true France and Germany do have that stereotype about them. However atm I would not take the EU as an example for anything at all, its leaning rightward more and more, which is fine, till extremism takes hold. As for Americans, I did not spend much time there, 1 year, but all the people I met were lovely and whenever I spoke Arabic with any Arabs we would always be asked by those around us to teach them, so you overgeneralizing an entire country is hurtful to all the people I connected with over there. There are already plenty of Arabic Language acquisition courses for expats here in Tunis as it is the place with the highest concentration of foreigners and they are filled almost every single semester. The core of our disconnect with our mother language is not in the Tunisian people themselves it is in the incredibly flawed educational system we have in place which needs to be changed for the better ASAP.

Quite frankly as someone who loves their mother language, Fos7a and Derja, I love that there are people such as yourself who are incredibly passionate about them, but its always important to keep in mind that everything in this world tends towards entropy; in terms of language that means that the best case scenario is for your citizens to know as many languages as possible and never to concentrate all your efforts on one.

Also I love that this Sub is in English, It serves as a good place for people who are wondering about Tunisia to ask questions and maybe we can even convince them to come visit us. What we have in this country is beautiful and we should share as much of it as we can( except for shale gas, Shell and BP stop your shit). 

And finally the demographic I'm reaching for is people between the ages of 18-40 from any nationality preferably living in Tunisia, but not necessarily who are at all interested in art. I wrote it in English because I was under the impression that most Tunisians in this Sub would speak English and I would reach a larger demo if I used the Language that 99% of the people on this sub speak. 

Holy god that was Long. 

tl;dr Learn all the languages! Our educational system is ripping the Arabic language away from us. There are plenty of foreigners learning Arabic at the Bourguiba institute for modern languages. And my demo is the last paragraph :P

True, it's the only sustainable way for Tunisia. It has a small internal market the TND at the moment isn't backed by a real economy or enough foreign currency. A weaker currency will increase Tunisian exports. 

Greece has no way of devaluing its currency. ECB sets it.

I have a relative, who got picked on the street randomly, this was a year and a half ago, because ""they had a picture of a terrorist that looked like him"", while in the police station, he wasn't identified by cops, he wasn't shown a picture of this terrorist that he looks like, he was just beaten up, and thrown on the street.

dh7bxug,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/69icc5/,2,"I don't understand people who criticize ennahda for this. It's true that the law is counter revolutionary but they have no choice. They came second in elections and chose to get into government instead of staying outside of it. They are pressured to support essebsi in this law that he's adamant about. Maybe they can soften it a bit. 


Ennahda being in the coalition is better than the left being in it and letting marzoug lead nida. We all know what happened with jabhat il-inkadh the first time and how easily they could have gone even further in the Egyptian model. Ennahda in the open is better than being in jails. 



Ennahda can never bring real change or implement revolutionary demands at least in the next decade. It's still vulnerable and afraid. If they leave power without any deal then they get purged. If they take on their responsibility for their voters and attempt to make real change then they get accused of wanting to make the country like Afghanistan. The former education Minister said just that few days ago. I think the tunisian left has understood the power of islamophobia and has tweaked it to only target ennahda and make it a Boogeyman. It doesn't matter how accurate the accusations are, the old regime propaganda coupled with horrible media representation has created fear in the hearts of people and they exploit it for votes.

The north east is a more liberal area, you should be fine. However, the south and the west are more conservative outside of tourist places like Djerba or Zarzis. Dressing modestly in these places is better for women, signs of affection in public are not very well seen. 
Expect many many road blocks and police check points (I've even seen a checkpoint on a highway two years ago). Most of airline employees are OK, theft incidents are mostly reported by luggage handlers or customs. 
Always bargain in shops (except supermarkets of course), but if your wife speaks tunisian arabic you'll be fine. 
Some parts of the latest travel warning by the US state Dept. are honestly BS (other parts are not), like ""Be alert to the possibility of kidnapping;"", I don't think I ever heard of any tourist kidnapping in the country.

Tunis is actually safer than my current city(Frankfurt). As for theft and pickpocketing, unless you go to ghettos you will be ok security is especially high near poplular monuments. Terrorism is of course a problem like here in europe but Tunisia did not have an attack since almost 2 years and that was before the series of attacks started to hit multiple european cities. As for the airport thefts, I travel quiet frequently to Tunisia and I never had anything get stolen and I dont lock my suitcase that well most of the time. I dont know how common is that however. Make sure to lock your bag just in case.

Let me put in in simple words, for your simple brain.

When you tell someone to not do something, because **YOU** follow a religion that states that **that something** is forbidden, you have oppressed them, and made them follow your religion's rules by force.

The Topnet guy came out yesterday and said the TT guy had to go to Call of Prayer and would be by after, never showed up.

The problem exactly is that no one does their jobs properly.  We're approaching almost 3 weeks now.  They closed our ticket 2 time previously.  The first because it was ""resolved"" without ever checking and the 2nd time, they called my wife who couldn't get to the phone in time.  She called them back and talked to them immediately after.  They closed it for ""unable to reach customer"".  

No one wants to work during Ramadan and want to cut corners because, fuck it, it's not THEIR Internet that is down so what do they care.

Thank you for your long critique. I am Biotechnology Student in Germany. Ofcourse I can talk almost only about the Research in biological field. I give an exemple, my professor told me that she would like to have me for the phd programm. First I said yes but...then I did my research...About Jobs in Germany and USA. I found out that in the industry they often write 2-3 years experience Masters degree or phD degree ...That made me mad!!!
During the phd programm they pay you only 50% or evan 40% of the normal job payment for only 2- 3 years that means if you need more time there is a big possiblity that you need to take a loan or if you are german get the social help means 400 euro per month, which is sad for a person with such a higher education. There are exeptions like in the Mathematics and Informatics you get 100% payment. Because there are less people that study mathematics than biology.
In germany when you finish your PhD you can work as a post doc in the academia. They wont pay 100% in the most cases you will carry on with 40-50% payment, which is sad. Then you have the big problem you cant stay more then 12 years academia including you phD time it is just the law. So if you are 12 Years in academia you need to get a professorship or a perment job., which is very difficult to get. For the industry you are mostly too old that means the companies has to pay you more by law and you have a phd that means your starting salery has to be higher be law but you lack the working experience, something that very important for the industry. You are more expensive to them. They will ask them selves if they really need someone as expensive or they take a younger master graduents that is still open for new ideas and actually can just do the same work. I will link some pages were you can see for your self that the working experience is more relevant than the degree:

If something wrong happens to you, contact your embassy asap.
Don't trust the phony smiles.
There are beautiful places to visit and to enjoy, dishes to try, wine to taste, festivals to attend etc. The problem is with the people and their mentality, not the country, so find the right people.
Further you go from the north and from coastal cities, the more you  have to be careful.
There are problems everyday and everywhere in the country, but it's better to be prepared, you may not face any, but you never know.
Enjoy your stay.

Yes, I indeed plan to obtain each banknote from circulation, or at least 50 dinars (2008 and 2011 series), 20 dinars (2011 series), 10 dinars (2005 and 2013 series) and 5 dinars (2008 and 2013 series). Also, 20 dinars from 1992 and 30 dinars from 1997, if they are still in circulation - that'd make exactly 200 TND.

To my knowledge there is none, only one speech which opened a somewhat heated (though healthy) debate that is naturally dying off as this is barely news anymore. 

But nowhere is something being actually done to qualify as ""pressing ahead"", and I really don't think this will result in anything concrete in the short term tbh, just BCE trying to score some political points while doing nothing, and he's been getting international praise for weeks because of it.

Also, don't forget that you still can visit 3 other states:

* Monastir: Less than 30 min away (electrical train).. You can visit multiple beautiful places in there like Ribat &amp; the Mausoleum of Bourguiba..
* Mahdia: 2 hours away from Sousse using the electrical train.. You can visit places like ""Borj Errass"", have a coffee in Sidi Salem café.. You can also go to the Roman amphitheater in El Jem, but you'll need a car I guess.. El Jem is in the Mahdia state but not very near to Sousse or Mahdia
* Kairouna: At most 2 hours from Sousse (using a car), you can visit the Great Mosque &amp; Bi'r Barouta and eat some hot ""Kaftéji"" x)

This is a major financing, the first of the EIB in favor of a Tunisian public bank since 2012.

&gt;The € 120 million financing contract was signed today in Tunis by Mr. Ahmed Rjiba, General Manager of the Housing Bank (BH) and Ms. Flavia Palanza, Director of Loan Operations in Tunisia. the neighboring countries to the EIB, in the presence of HE Mr. Ridha Chalgoum, Minister of Finance, of HE Mr. Zied Ladhari, Minister of Development, Investment and International Cooperation, who also signed the Guarantee Agreement on behalf of the Government Tunisia for the State guarantee provided for this loan.

&gt;Granted on advantageous conditions in terms of maturity and rate, this financing will be able to significantly improve the loan conditions of project leaders while helping to consolidate the banking sector by diversifying funding sources and reducing costs. financing. It is aimed primarily at SMEs but also at small and very small businesses that offer value and job creation. Civil society is also expected to play an important role in this financing agreement for greater effectiveness of action both in terms of raising awareness and supporting the companies financed.

&gt;This new line of credit will focus on the financing of projects in various industrial and service sectors including Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), public and private health, pharmaceutical industry, education, cultural activities, agribusiness, not to mention the energy transition sector with renewable energies and energy efficiency. Particular attention will be paid to export and access to new external markets.

&gt;""This is emblematic financing that reflects our commitment to Tunisian public banks to accelerate access to corporate finance,"" said Flavia Palanza, Director of Lending Operations in Neighborhood Countries at the EIB. ""I am even more pleased to sign this new financing with the Habitat Bank with which we have been linked for many years by a partnership of trust and high quality. By giving small project owners and businesses the means to develop, we support local employment and economic development in Tunisia, two of the EIB's main priorities for action. With this new line of credit, it is a strong signal that we want to give to civil society to medium, small and very small businesses. We offer new job opportunities to Tunisian youth. ""

&gt;""The Housing Bank is particularly proud and pleased with the signing of this credit line, which testifies to the EIB's confidence in Tunisia and our bank,"" said Ahmed Rjiba, General Manager of BH. ""It is also a recognition by a prestigious and rigorous European financial institution of the performance of BH, particularly for the progress made in the implementation of its restructuring program. The close collaboration with the EIB, which goes back more than 22 years, is thus revived. It allows us to increase our support for the national economy, SMEs and job creation. This loan also contributes to the consolidation of our stable resources. It is a valuable contribution to the realization of our 2017-2021 business plan. This loan is certainly the starting point for developing other avenues of collaboration. Mr. Rjiba also underlined the significance of the guarantee of this loan by the State, once again confirming the success of the bank as a true public-private partnership model.

&gt;This EIB financing is part of the dynamics of the European Neighborhood Policy, whose support for the development and competitiveness of businesses is a strong axis of action. It also responds to the priorities of the Economic Resilience Initiative set up by the EIB to support job creation and financial inclusion of small and medium-sized enterprises in countries affected by the refugee crisis.

&gt;As the first international development financier in Tunisia, the EIB committed at the international conference ""Tunisia 2020"" in November 2016 to support up to 2.5 billion euros by 2020 the mutation of Tunisia . Support for the private sector and entrepreneurship is at the heart of this exceptional mobilization with the aim of supporting inclusive and sustainable growth, a source of jobs for the younger generations.",2017-11-08 22:06:58

You can then go get a 1 month extension.  If you stay after that it's a 10tnd a week fine but being from the US they could waive that fine.  You can go after that and try to have it extended.

I've been here since July 2014 and I went once for an extension and that was it.  I am currently obtaining my residence card which is pretty simple.  You can do it yourself or go through a lawyer.  It's a simple process and cheap to do it yoursel but Tunisia is a pain in the ass when it comes to simple stuff.  They may say ""oh you need this paper"" that you go obtain then the tell you ""Oh you need this paper too"" then you gotta go do that then they tell you ""Oh you gotta go to this place first"" then you find out you didn't need one of those papers, and it can be a pain.  I'm using a lawyer as it's still pretty cheap (about 150tnd so far, probably about 300 total) just to avoid this hassle and headache.

The way they see it, is they're glad you're here spending money.  My situation may be different as I'm married to a Tunisian and it's unclear if you are.",2017-01-28 05:23:42

Is marijuana addictive? Well in Tunisia it is addictive, it's even way more addictive than a lot of scarier substances, and it kills your brain cells, the same exact way as breathing in glue, it leads to basically insanity. Real marijuana is extremely rare here, and i think, educating the people, on what they're doing to themselves, should be our number one priority, and i personally don't think that spreading the word would change things, but at least do it, i think the ultimate solution, is for the government, to handle the situation, by taking production and selling over, And to the guy saying: ""Why does Holland work so well? Because they were alright BEFORE weed. Otherwise legalise and tunisia will.become a drug fueled city at the beginning. Educate them.first"" you're comparing Marijuana, to the drug used in Tunisia now, which is unfair, if we clean the drug that exists on our streets now, a lot of people will need treatment, Marijuana will not be a substitute to it, it will do nothing to them, Marijuana is harmless, don't compare it to that blocs of plastic sold now on our streets.

Isn't that shitty writing?




What I wrote in arabic was a famous expression. What you linked to was a whole blog. 


And since this is a tunisian sub, I have the right to assume the official language of the country is accepted. You on the other hand shouldn't assume french to be accepted. You should have at least made the language clear and offered your help to translate in case I don't know french. 



Now to the islamophobia, the comments there actually claimed that mosques are a trojan horse of the arab occupation, that muslim arabs are somehow continually bedouin...



And the author said salafism is a denial of everything preislamic which is a lie.

I didn't neither assume that all Tunisians speak fluently French, but rather, that in the Tunisian dialect we use French-origin words.

''Tunisian is Arabic'' ?  what do you mean by that ? Arabic as an cultural identity ? but what Tunisian have on common apart from the language and religion ? So if Tunisia is influenced by that doesn't make Tunisians Arabs.
'' we made a huge chunk of this civilization '' by ''we'' you mean Arabs ? if so, the huge impact is due to the religion, as any ideology, have more impact than any other mean of conquest.

der7yi8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/5xadip/,1,"That is not exaggerated at all.  Cab drivers especially will ignore the laws including just going through a red light when it's clear.  They will stop but the rest of traffic will stop and stay, cabs will go on before it even turns green.  Stop signs are ignored as well for the most part and people just roll through them if it's clear to go.  

People will travel the wrong direction on entrance/exit ramps constantly.  People will use the sidewalk and the sides of the road to create lanes of traffic, especially near the airport where it gets backed up.  I had one guy yell at me because I wouldn't move my car because he tried to cut through traffic by going onto the sidewalk and the parked cars were blocking him in.  I was in the parked car and he got upset.

You obviously don't live here and never seen it.  you say it's your hometown of Tunis but I live here and I'm betting you don't.  People cut in front of each other all the time.  Traffic backs up because people will make complete u-turns in the middle of the road.  People park up on sidewalks where they're not supposed to. 

If you dispute any of this I will be sure to show you the cars parked right outside tonight if you want.  I live here and it's not my hometown but like I said, laws are flaunted here regularly.  

I said they FOLLOW unwritten rules like if there's an opening because someone else is turning left in front of traffic stopping it, you can go ahead and turn right since no cars are coming.  I'm telling you, driving here is nothing like it is in Germany, US, France, or UK.

Now I use my topnet connection just to watch videos or any other and had to use ooredoo data plan...and hell those bastard robbed me like nobody else did before XD with an unstable 100-120 ping which spikes to 250 few times...maybe once per minute!
Tried my father's phone which was TT....it was ping 80 stable!
Now I bought a new sim-card and it's stable 75-80 at night and about 85 in the day...and one good thing I noticed is that I can play 2x games with TT compared to ooreedo lol ! No joke.
I recommend trying TT or maybe Orange because it depends on where you live.

&gt; Link good places to visit in tunisia

we might need to put that in a FAQ/wiki for the subreddit. Any further suggestions welcome!

&gt; Add some rules like...

Just so you know all those rules are already in place, just not mentioned in the sidebar (except the related to Tunisia one). You have no idea how many people find the sub and think ""Oh, a tunisian community ? what a great opportunity to advertise my shitty click-baity website!""

Same with the languages of course.

&gt; change the 749 ""readers"" to ""harrisa eaters"" for example
10 are eating harrisa right now

Yeah kinda like the big subs do, I like it but let's update the sidebar first

&gt; A more beautiful banner

The banner isn't exactly that ugly, I mean many big subs don't even have one. Anyway, making those isn't that easy, we could always ask for one in r/Banners I guess. Any propositions are welcome!

That would depend on the business you're going to start though, if it's industrial or selling real physical ""stuff"", then you're totally right, but a service business is doable with that amount i think isn't ? specially if you avoid the capital (am in Bizerte).



&gt; I would suggest that you invest that into an ongoing trust-able business rather than annoying yourself with stuff you don't know.

You mean do something related to my current business (game dev) ?

I actually thought about that, and tried to find people to hire but couldn't find any (online) specially when it come to artists who can draw and animate.

I am more into the game design aspect rather than pure programming (coding is just a mean to reach my goal, i don't *LOVE* it that much), so currently I just have this [old blog](http://alaslipknot.tumblr.com/) that I update whenever i can.

&gt; Im not too sure what you do to generate your revenue 

Many ways, I encourage you to read the comment in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/52xnyc/my_monthly_income_since_i_decided_to_start/) cause I answered many ""how do you make money"" question, but mainly my incomes come from (in order) : 

* Programming other people games

* Fixing and/or do what other client's (beginner?) freelancers couldn't do

* Creating games ""for free"" and share revenue with publishers.

&gt; Who are your clients, and what do they do?!

People who want to get into the game business, some of them are fools who just want to jump on the current hype-wagon of making flappy bird clones (when it was famous) others are great passionate people who really want to make good games, and of course, none of is Tunisian nor Arab, and I personally try to avoid these as much as possible (had many issues with them when i started working)

&gt; Are you a fullstack eng or a game dev?

Hmm, well, Officially i don't have any degree, I dropout of college after 2 years of pure stupidity (Informatique-&gt;Sys Embarqué fi ISET bizerte), so officially am nothing :D 

But, If I am allowed to name myself, I would love to say that I am a Game Creator, my goal is to be a Game Designer and director, but of course you can't sell your goals or dream so you need to have a ""measurable"" skill, and Since there is no way to make a good game or at least understand what you're doing without programming, I found myself hooked to it since the first time i got introduced to it (16y.o, 2emme info). 

During my ""professional life"" (if i can call it that lol), I made games using : 

* Flash (AS2.0 &amp; AS3.0)

* Java (libGdx &amp; LWJGL)

* C# (Unity)

&gt; These look like desktop unity games and nothing mobile. Mobile is mainly Play Store Android or App Store iOS.

I never made a commercial desktop game, I assume you are talking about the ones I participate with in LudumDare ? yes these are Web and Desktop, but my main source of money comes from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.

&gt; I see. Thanks for sharing. I was hoping for Swift, Objective C, Cocoa, core animation/data, RESTful etc and Native Android development.

Like I said before, I don't see myself as a Tech/Programmer guy, I really don't care much about all these, I just want to create games, I tried to get involve with more native library (libGDX &amp; LWJGL for Android) but I found myself recreating **A LOT** of stuff that game developers take for granted nowadays (rendering, collisions, physics, etc..) and that was a waste of time for me, specially from a business perspective. I don't belong to a rich family, and dropping out of college was a FUCKING STRESSFUL decision, having everyone bashing on you and blaming you for it + the fact that you know that you have nothing to ""*ensure*"" your future with, making money was my main priority back then (2012) and that year i pretty much ""wasted"" jumping from tool to tool, I tried native languages, platform exclusive frameworks and multi-platform frameworks, I also tried other engines, to finally settling up with Unity, It was just incredibly fast to make prototype and the balance it has between programming/design was the main reason i kept working with it.

Cause at the end of the day, what matters to me is Players enjoying *my games*, and neither me nor them will care about if the game is created using GamerMaker, Unity or made from scratch with C++ .

Ce qui marque un nouveau record historique de l'indice; le précédent record date du 22 avril 2012 à 10.720 DT.



L'indice Keftaji, un plan tunisien populaire, permet d'avoir une idée sur le pouvoir d'achat du tunisien en mesurant la variation hebdomadaire du coût d'un plat pour 4 à 6 personnes. 

Les ingrédients de l'indice Keftaji sont les suivants : pomme de terre (1kg), tomate (500g), poivron (500g), piment (250g), potiron/citrouille (500g), courgette (250g), œufs (6 pièces), huile de friture (1l), baguettes de pain (3 pièces).

Automatiser serait une excellente alternative pour pouvoir utiliser et analyser cet indice, et on a mentionné la source d'une partie de ces ingrédients dans une édition précédente de TuniData, qui sont malheureusement pas disponible en format ouvert. Peut-être ça serait une occasion de faire une demande d'accès à l'information avec la nouvelle loi 22-2016 à l'ONAGRI.

====

Lol. You almost made me think we're in a theocracy like Saudi Arabia or Iran. 

====
What you (and most people) understand from the wordings of the law couldn't be further from the true purpose behind it. The State isn't controlled by the Religion, or submitting to it. Our modern State actually took control of the Religion (i.e the religious institutions: Mosques, Kottabs, Aw9af, etc ..) and gave itself the permission to monitor it and enforce an ""official"" religious discourse and interpretation through its own appointed ""religious"" employees (State preachers for the Friday prayers, Islamic Education professors...), just like any post-modernist state that encompasses and monitors every aspect inside its borders (to the point where we're now heading to an Orwellian State). Make no mistake, even France controls all religions inside its borders in that sense.

====
In contrast, in traditional Islamic societies, the religious body always had some degree of autonomy via the political authorities. Through the Wa9f institution, they were financially indépendant from the State and therefore could operate their institutions on their own, and decide freely on the interpretation of the Islamic law that was applied by the Qadis, and even confront the rulers when they transgress their limits (that's the perfect model anyway).

==
Contrast this with now, where the Religion is just a ministry, a domain under the thumb of the state, just like Industry, or Tourism.... It either controls the State, or the State controls it. And in the latter case (just like ours), all semblance of religious laws are completely meaningless because they're entirely dépendant on the authorities as to what the laws actually mean or when they're applied on who.

====
(Spoiler alert: It's no coincidence that the ""law in Tunisia that put you in prison for 6 months if you curse the god"" is only ever applied on the poor and middle class if it ever got applied. That's its purpose, a placeholder law so that the conservative-leaning middle and poor class feel good while the bourgeois class embarks itself and the rest of the country through the state institutions towards the West. The bourgeois class controls everything here, including the laws, so there's no way one of their own will ever get convicted for such a ""trivial"" law like this, if there ever was someone foolish enough to accuse them. For the others, the police knows they don't have to do busy work and make the courts do busy work as well, because the state doesn't really care. Unless they need to make a point, like quelling public anger over the DJ public incident, in which case such laws are called to action.)

======
&gt; I know its not active, but its there, and that alone is a shame.

===
What would I consider a shame is that such laws (that are easily circumvented by everyone on a daily basis) are the extent of what we call Islamic laws in Tunisia. It doesn't matter whether your clothes are prude or revealing, whether you fornicate or not, whether you curse or not ... when everyone including the ""religious"" ones are swiped in the post-modernist secular nihilistic current that overwhelms the entire world after 3 centuries of capitalism, colonization and globalization, just because Europe had its Industrial Revolution, and the rest of the world didn't even had the time to that because it needs to catch up. 

==
We poor plebs are arguing over semantics and appearances. We're 2 sides of the same coin, and our thoughts are being infiltrated and modified on a daily basis by something else entirely.

One thing I love about being an American is that I can say anything I want to against anything or anyone as long as I'm not threatening someone or lying about someone.  I can paint a picture of Jesus Christ with feces.  I can make an ""art installation"" of anti-religion stuff or anti-government stuff.  I can wipe my ass with a picture of the president or burn an American flag and there's nothing that can be done to me.

One thing lost on Reddit when people bad mouth the US, yeah, we got some issues but I can at least speak out.  Trump has been mocked all over the place and other than him calling them names, he can't do anything.  Reporters can't be thrown in prison.  They can't commit suicide by shooting themselves in the head three times in the back of the head.

We can also put religious call of prayers to music and though I don't agree with those things (I'm not really that religious) I think someone should have the right to do it.

There has been no infrastructure changes and the only thing the government seems concerned about are superficial things.

They ""cleared the sidewalks"" of Cafe's in Tunis in Lac 2 (maybe other areas but I think mostly in Lac 2) but they didn't clean any of it up.  Now, I hate that cafes have decided to take up sidewalk space as free real estate for their cafes but there HAD to be a better solution than just bulldozing it and making it look like a war zone.  

It saddens me because I really wish I could run for President here.  The first things I'd do is work on infrastructure and that, right there, is jobs.  Thousands and thousands of jobs.  There needs to be better policing, better roads, better utilities like water, gas, power and internet, better public transportation.

Let's look at a small country that has succeeded in transforming its economy into a hub for high tech and we'll see that such a thing isn't possible here. Let's take israel for example. Some people would ask why did israel make it in  such a sector and we couldn't. Israel was an independent country 8 years before us. They had more than half the population educated in European countries with the highest standards at the time. They had extensive financial support from the Diaspora and foreign country. They decided to open their political system for opposition at the end of Ben-Gurion's life at the same time when Bourguiba thought the population isn't mature enough for democracy and he quelled any descent. At the 90's their government started supporting the entrepreneurial spirit, financing such projects and creating incubators. Their military helps with training in high tech and networking. They received plenty of russian professionals in that decade especially engineers. 20 years later they get rewarded for that hard work with some caveats. 



As you can see such sectors, that can be monumental in a small country's economy and give it the edge it needs to compete with western countries who benefit from their empire building past and far Eastern countries who have cheap labor and few regulations, need time and money to be developed. We need to fix our education system first for such a thing to work. We need businessmen to stop stealing and start doing philanthropy like their western counterparts who donate to musuems, universities, research institutions... ",2017-04-18 11:12:12

dgezgjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/65upad/,1,"There has been some accusations that the protests are instigated by the party of former president Moncef marzougi. I don't think that's true. 


The protests are political in the same form social justice and creating jobs are political matters in every single country.



The protests are not unified. Many regions are protecting similar grievances even if they're somewhat different. It's happening mostly in the middle and south of the country. People think they're being cheated out of life. They've been waiting for promises to be fulfilled for a long time. They see multinational companies profiting of their resources and they perceive no giving back. Even if those companies aren't doing anything wrong, the optics are bad, really bad. Spending has increased so much and salaries haven't. 



There are also various other protests that tangentially meet with these other protests but not directly. Taxi drivers are on some sort of strike. Students and professors at law schools and engineering schools have been on strike for different reasons and there seems to be getting better. Judges are sounding alarms about the constitutional court and that might escalate hard. 




I don't see any type of resolution to all of this. The economy is bad and won't get fixed for at least a decade. It's badly formed and our backers are just making empty promises. Protests will keep growing and the government can't do anything about it because they're weak and they'll get weaker as protests get stronger. It's a vicious circle. True reform needs time and requires cracking down on corruption which is impossible to do by weak government and immoral judiciary. Powerful people won't allow it. Foreign interests won't allow it. The labors unions are too strong and too ideologically stubborn to allow any real change that might affect their status. 


Look at the latest nessma scandal. How can we combat corruption with such a corrupt media landscape.

If such a figures arises and has the same analysis as I do now and wants to do good with a bit of force then I will oppose such a thing.

You might look at this and see a contradiction but I don't. I'd oppose this figure because I won't be sure of his intentions, his interests, his allegiances and his will or even ability to quit once everything is fine.

Freedom of speech? Check!

Freedom of assembly? Yes! 

Possibility of punishing corrupt politicians through the ballot? Sure!

A vibrant civil society that can finally work ""in the open""? At last!

Then why not give this goddamn revolution a chance will we? 
All it took is a few years of a hard economic situation and we're already looking for a dictator figure. But the only thing that such a strong man (even a ""benevolent"" one) can bring to the table is provide a cover for the disinterest of the citizens from politics. Like *why should I give a fuck? It's all sorted by leader X!*

But as you said in another comment, as a citizen ""Those things directly affect your life"" so you absolutely should at least pay attention if not get actively involved in the politics of your country/region/municipality. Do protest against unjust laws. Do protest against corruption. Some NGO are doing amazing work, do support them. Just, do give a fuck.*

Yes I don't like him in general, I think he's the reason for so much of the issues we have now. I like some particular aspects about him though. That's a whole different discussion.



Tje figure I'm describing isn't like Bourguiba. Bourguiba started as a somewhat client to the French and persecuted his political rivals from the start (ben salah and falaga). He instituted borderline fascist policies in many aspects of life. The figure I'm speaking of wouldn't do these things and would give up power as soon as the job is done. In another comment I likened the arrangement as a Roman republic dictator who is at first elected then gets more power to deal with an emergency and then gives it back to the senate (in our case Parliament or have other elections)




&gt;Regardless, as they say absolute power corrupts absolutely, and I think that no matter the good intentions, no one man can hold the keys to improving a whole country.



I disagree. The power I'm proposing isn't absolute like at the time of ben ali, it's more negotiated and put together through aliances of patriotic people. 



In our case one man can have tremendous effect, won't change everything but will make first steps. One man who isn't afraid of the existing power structure and deals with it swiftly will definitely bring much progress. He needs to make drastic reforms that the ugtt will oppose and he needs to prosecute corrupt people who will definitely strike back. 



Those two things will begin a truly functional second republic.


Look at the major changes developing countries had to catch up, in japan, china, russia, israel and plenty others, some forms of forcefulness brought political and economic independence.(of course it brought oppression but this is not our case).



Neither of the 4 current powers that can win elections can ever exact change. If not by these people then how are we  going to have the change you're speaking of. From what you said there is no solution for the next decade. 



&gt;The salvation of Tunisia can only come from within its own people. The one that can make Tunisia better, at the risk of sounding cheesy af, is ""all of us"".

We're still in the same situation. The problems wasn't only ben ali and his family. The corruption is systematic and nothing has been done about it. Look at every time people started speaking about justice from the people who tortured them or tax evaders or corrupt politicians and businessmen. They get silenced right away. The people of RCD are being co-opted by all political parties. Abir moussa is everywhere on TV attacking sihem ben sidrine. Isn't this a symptom of the overall dysfunction?



&gt; but what is **our** excuse as Tunisians? 


We didn't get rid of the system when we had a revolution. We were more concerned about their feelings and western opinions and we didn't dare touch the real culprits. Remember all the talk about the French revolution at first?



&gt;The dictator and his corrupt family? We got rid of them!

&gt;Freedom of assembly? Yes! 

&gt;Possibility of punishing corrupt politicians through the ballot? Sure!

That doesn't solve immediate problems. And it won't change anything because voters don't have only economic issues in mind. Politicians will find other issues to inflame to get elected and then rince and repeat. Look at nida tounis, they campaigned on hating ennahda, then didn't get enough votes and had to make an alliance with their rival. The radical faction broke off and formed a jabhat inkadh 2.0 and is now campaigning on hating ennahda. They won't get enough votes and they'll have two choices, either ally with ennahda and disintegrate to pieces like nida or let ennahda form a coalition and lose electorates trust or have another election after failing to form a government. Is this what we're going to live for every couple of years? Are these people going to solve our problems? My answer is no to the second question.

&gt;All those things could never bring economic prosperity and wealth. 

Bullshit. Of course they do, for a resource-poor country like Tunisia, people are the best investment. Also, people need to stop treating freedom of speech as a luxury for the sophisticated. Lack thereof is how corruption thrives. It's not irrelevant. Were we wealthy and prosperous when Ben Ali was ruling? Then why do you expect prosperity and wealth to happen in a few years? I don't know how old you are but the problems we're facing today are not new. We were just not even aware of them pre-2011. It may seem there is much corruption now but there was even more before and no one dared even say the word.

That would be no one..

Not when they are protesting apparently. And voting is just as valid means of protest as any. Again, as I said , the current situation will hopefully teach people to be less susceptible to populist ideas and vote better next time.

But bourguiba did even more harm. He repressed even more people. And his biggest flaw imo is that he brainwashed more people into a personality cult which made change even harder to achieve later on. Ben ali at least wasn't successful in his brainwashing plan, not for the lack of trying by for other reasons outside his control.

And when will that change happen? Is it going to solve anything in this next decade? I think not.




&gt;It's not like the current political class have their hands tied when it comes to corruption either. They just don't really want to fight it that much.. 



You don't really know. We don't know what happens behind the scenes. We don't know which businessman paid which official. We don't which foreign ambassy dictates the actions of which politician. We don't know where the loyalties of former ben ali officials who are still in power lie. We don't know which media organization work against the best intrests of the country. Remember nessma and its role in overthrowing plenty of former governments with the help of few protestors at bardo. Won't poloticians be afraid of channels like nessma who feign objectivity whilst having ulterior motives and being quite influential? Aren't ministers already afraid of the na9aba?


&gt;At one point we need to take matters into our own hands and elect better people next time. 


That will take decades to achieve with every mandate lasting at least 4 years. And we'll eventually have a two party system and nothing will change as evidenced by every western country. The establishment wins in the end, sort of.


&gt; Political parties are not football teams, so fuck them all and let's start over next time what's the harm? 


The problem is that they're the same people being incarnated in different parties and coalitions. The electoral map is so unstable still. I don't we'll be getting rid of these faces for the next 20 years.


&gt;If they are too stubborn to listen to us then they can only blame themselves either in the short term with growing social unrest or in the medium term during the elections. 



I support that. But there is also the dilemma that social unrest hurts people more than the powerful. And the middle class and upper middle class will favor stability over long term gains.

Radicals weren't going to change anything either. They would have just imploded our relations with SA and the west and undermined the moral position of our revolution by cosing up to assad for ideological considerations. 



I'm assuming the opposite of conservatism you're speaking of is al-jabha. Is that right? Do you honestly think they could be able to lead anything in the next 2 decades? I can't see them succeed in ruling.





&gt;Bullshit. Of course they do, for a resource-poor country like Tunisia, people are the best investment. Also, people need to stop treating freedom of speech as a luxury for the sophisticated. Lack thereof is how corruption thrives. It's not irrelevant. Were we wealthy and prosperous when Ben Ali was ruling? Then why do you expect prosperity and wealth to happen in a few years? I don't know how old you are but the problems we're facing today are not new. We were just not even aware of them pre-2011. It may seem there is much corruption now but there was even more before and no one dared even say the word.


And you said it outloud. And screamed from the rooftops. What changed? Nothing at all. Looking at effing america and how much coverage Trump's stupid shit is getting and tell what does that achieve? Nothing at all bro. He's a stupid brainwashed old man and won't listen to liberals even if his life depended on it.



&gt;That would be no one..


But you just said free speech will get you wealth.





&gt;Not when they are protesting apparently. And voting is just as valid means of protest as any. Again, as I said , the current situation will hopefully teach people to be less susceptible to populist ideas and vote better next time.



Fear mongering works better. They'll be terrorized by the notion of ennahda winning and turning us into iran and they'll vote based on that brainwashing and put the same assholes in power and the same assholes who rule from the background.

Are you looking for foreign investment or something? Otherwise using english doesn't make sense at all.


I don't really know for how long we're going to be like this. This is a tunisian sub about tunisia so it should be in arabic. People who live in Tunisia should learn the language. The french are pushy about their language. The germans ignore you when you don't speak german in Germany. And english speaking countries will scream xenophobic shit to you if you don't learn english or ""american"" as some would say there. We need to be like them and institute some arabic learning classes, we shouldn't be xenophobic or overbearing but we should indeed encourage it.



This isn't directed to you OP. You're free to do as you like. It's more of an institutional problem. My city for example just renovated a public park and put some wood there in ways to help kids play and jump and what not. They put one big sign describing the park in arabic and french in equal space and then they made small signs next to every structure and put it only in french. I mean which fucking kid reads signs in french to teach him how to jump? It's so infuriating that these obnoxious elitists think they're in effing paris.

dgq9j7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/67b8gw/,1,"&gt;you mention that Americans are xenophobic and the French are pushy, and Germans ignore you when you don't speak their Language. 



I brought those examples up to show that other people are actively trying to preserve their language and we should too. Many are not like that but some are. 



&gt;As for Americans, I did not spend much time there, 1 year, but all the people I met were lovely and whenever I spoke Arabic with any Arabs we would always be asked by those around us to teach them, so you overgeneralizing an entire country is hurtful to all the people I connected with over there.


I wasn't generalizing, at least I didn't mean to. Your experience doesn't contradict what I said because first those are your friends and second you don't speak only arabic there. 



&gt;There are already plenty of Arabic Language acquisition courses for expats here in Tunis as it is the place with the highest concentration of foreigners and they are filled almost every single semester. 



I don't know the demographic there but I assume like any other arabic language class it's mainly filled with yound people who will eventually leave. I was speaking more about the people who live in tunisia for decades and never learn arabic and our own people (not sure if I can call them that) who are ashamed of arabic.




&gt;The core of our disconnect with our mother language is not in the Tunisian people themselves


I think that's a big problem too.



&gt; in terms of language that means that the best case scenario is for your citizens to know as many languages as possible and never to concentrate all your efforts on one.


That's not the issue here. We're not talking about isolationism. There is an issue in a country where its old folk can't understand anything around them because all signs are in the latin script. 




&gt;Also I love that this Sub is in English, It serves as a good place for people who are wondering about Tunisia to ask questions and maybe we can even convince them to come visit us. What we have in this country is beautiful and we should share as much of it as we can( except for shale gas, Shell and BP stop your shit). 



I don't agree. Non arabic speakers can ask and be answered in the language they can understand. We shouldn't eliminate every mention of arabic in this sub just on the off chance someone might see it. Every sub that represents a non Anglophone country use their own language for most posts. When foreigners chime in, then they help them out with translations. That's how people who have self confidence in their language act.





&gt;And finally the demographic I'm reaching for is people between the ages of 18-40 from any nationality preferably living in Tunisia, but not necessarily who are at all interested in art. I wrote it in English because I was under the impression that most Tunisians in this Sub would speak English and I would reach a larger demo if I used the Language that 99% of the people on this sub speak. 




That's your assumption but it's not the reality of the sub I think. 




&gt;tl;dr Learn all the languages! 


That's not the point at all. I'm actually an enthusiast for everything english. Preservation does not equal isolation.

Personally, I think this is a great step in the right direction.  I know that not all laws (or abolishing of laws) is going to work everywhere but I think that Tunisia is in a prime spot to make decriminalization of marijuana work for them.  This is a go to destination for vacations for people from Libya, England, France, and especially, Germany.  None of these places have legal recreational (Only Germany has for medicinal) and legalizing recreational use can be a HUGE draw for tourism which, lets face it, Tunisia relies on heavily.  A lot more than it should, but that's another debate.

With making it legal, you have the possibility of bringing in hundreds of millions of TND and it's possible to make that a Billion just from marijuana.  I smoked it for medicinal purposes in the US and if it was legal here, I would here too as I very much need it but can't get it and rely on taking a butt load of Dolapraine.

Every place that has legalized it from Amsterdam to specific states in the US, has seen a dramatic increase in tourism and taxable income.  You can still put heavy regulation on it (large taxes, only sold at pharmacies or specialized dispensaries, etc) and that brings up another point.  With the legalizing of marijuana, you don't only bring in the income of just the purchased marijuana but the pipes, papers, etc that come along with it.

With the money that comes from the sales and taxes you can then invest money in infrastructure, drug addiction counseling, as well as programs for those who need assistance for food and housing and not to mention the huge influx of money you can put into schools.

I'm interested if someone disagrees so if you do, please respond.  Let me know why and hoepfully, we can have a great debate. :D",2017-04-27 14:38:56

I know that التونسي نبار بطبعه but repeating that the subreddit is dead every chance you get and being the sub's resident complainer will not help you be taken seriously.. You believe an important subject is being ignored? Feel free to participate! Not everyone has the same definition of ""important"" as you do, you know?

This is indeed a small sub but it's slowly and steadily growing lately (by its own standards of course) and we're trying to improve it with this weekly discussion, in order to have a healthy and rich conversation about topical subjects related to Tunisia.

&gt; I disagree. These people broke the law. By definition they are criminals. Not all criminals should be treated the same but let's not distort definitions.

You're just being a smartass and arguing semantics when my point is clear as day. Yes *technically* if you don't put your seatbelt on you're a criminal but come on now...

And laws aren't the Holy Quran either, that is why they are being amended ALL THE TIME, and why some of them aren't even enforced. Just because it's the law doesn't mean it should stay that way.

&gt; I didn't deny that there is excessive implementation of that law and I'm for this amendment. People need to be given second chances.

Even if you do think zatla is that important, it's excessive to have all these posts about it and nothing else. 


And I'm sure the Tunisian people don't think zatla is the most important subject right now. They would say the economy, the exchange value, tataouine, unemployment, corruption, transitional justice, education, security, elections... I'm very sure zatla is not that high on the scale of priorities for average tunisians. Tunisians who are on the fringe obviously can post about their fringe intrests but when a whole sub turns into fringe central then I have the right to call out the fact that the sub is a niche forum and not representative of everyday tunisians.

I was only speaking about this sub, its focus on this subject, its exaggeration of the facts. I didn't address the law and put my personal opinion at the end which isn't congruent with the status quo. 




&gt;You're just being a smartass and arguing semantics when my point is clear as day. Yes *technically* if you don't put your seatbelt on you're a criminal but come on now...



Yeah they're both criminals. That's what criminal means afaik. But there are different categories of crime and those two don't match. Taking drugs is a crime. Simple as that. 



&gt;Just because it's the law doesn't mean it should stay that way.


Strawman again. 




&gt;So do you believe this amendment makes the law fair enough already? If so why? otherwise why not? 
 



Yeah it's fairer. It allows for taking extenuating circumstances into consideration especially for minors. It might help people not get a record. It gives second chances and wake up calls. It allows for treatment. 



I would be against legalization.

Please continue to update us regularly on the sub's vital status, I'm sure everyone is on the edge of their seats /s

&gt; Even if you do think zatla is that important, it's excessive to have all these posts about it and nothing else.

Users post what they like. And you can too.

&gt; And I'm sure the Tunisian people don't think zatla is the most important subject right now. They would say the economy, the exchange value, tataouine, unemployment, corruption, transitional justice, education, security, elections... 

Everyone is entitled to their opinions. And this sub (and even the Tunisian people) is not a monolith but a sum of individuals that are intellectually independent from each other. 
The Tunisian People^^TM doesn't have any opinions, so please stop putting your own words in everyone's mouths. If an issue is important to you, feel free to bring it up. Do not decide for people what is and is not important to them.

&gt; I'm very sure zatla is not that high on the scale of priorities for average tunisians. 

Very sure huh! So what? Do we need a ranked list of priorities that we should address one by one in descending order?!

The populace sees flagrant corruption and malfeasance and expect that politicians at least clamp down on that if they can't deliver jobs.

LOL Investors aren't dumb. They know that throwing money at a problem won't solve it. That's been Tunisia's problem since the 90's, you can't have investors showing up if you don't have the infrastructure (logistically and politically) that is essential for sustainable projects. We seem to think that some hot shot would show up with stacks of money and starts building roads before building a factory, who would do that knowing that there are many more suitable locations for investment (Morocco  jumps to mind)? So yeah, the devaluation of the Dinar won't bring any investors. 

The devaluation will encourage exports, that is indeed correct and may seem awesome since we export almost everything we produce *but* it sucks for two reasons:

- We also import almost everything we consume, bread, sugar, fruits, energy, cars (don't get me started on those) so the gains from the exports gain will go towards covering the new deficit caused by the imports, it's a zero sum game.

- It is assumed that the export sector is controlled by the state, which is not the case. A devaluation will make the exporters gain more while the rest of the population will suffer, so yeah this equivalent to stealing from the pockets of the poor and the salaried masses and depositing funds in exporters' pockets, people who are already rich for the most part. I am pretty sure that inequality is **the opposite** of why the revolution started by that's like my opinion, man. 

&gt;The finance minister's comments were unfortunate but the PM had the right to sack her. The government has to speak with a single voice and has to be coherent.

That is not entirely true, she was sacked because after she spoke about the EUR/TND exchange rate reaching 3 IMF said they never said so. Given that our country is literally run by IMF, she had to go. Also, she never really had power over the exchange rate, it is solely under the jurisdiction of the Central Bank to control the country's monetary policy. And you know where it gets better? The ministry of finance and the National Assembly have no power over the Central Bank, they can monitor their decisions but they cannot change them (legally that is) so yeah, it's a circus show. 

What seems to be the problem is that, in and out, people in charge have 0 economic culture. ",2017-05-03 20:04:45

Creating jobs is also the responsibility of the government. There are many ways the government is involved and actually responsible for what is going on especially is protectionist economies like ours. The government is lagging on its other duties like education and health which makes it harder to create jobs. Having an educated class that is completely divorced from the job market is very detrimental to creating jobs. Having negligible funds for research makes it difficult to be a competitive country in this globalised economy. The bureaucracy is abominable sometimes. 



All of these things and more are actually the fault of successive governments and their helpers abroad.



China got that many people out of poverty because it has cheap labor and weak labor laws which allows it to defeat any global competitor price wise. And now they're trying to outdo the competitors who have better quality too. China also has massive numbers of state employees and creates major housing and infrastructure projects.

dh856aq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/69lf4n/,1,"Propaganda is a misleading or biased information, how is posting police brutality on social media, and raising awareness, to help the police arrest their bad officers, and make it easy for them to identify through videos, and also identify witnesses to take their statements into arresting these cops, how does this harm national security and public order? Don't you think what they're saying is misleading and biased? Doesn't it make sense that OP called it propaganda? And they are saying that ""internet comments"" might cause disruption and chaos in the security forces ranks, like seriously? Training fighting  running shooting climbing mountains whatever they do god bless them, they can't stay focused because of comments on the internet? Even more misleading information. And the last paragraph is straight up authoritarian, I mean they're basically saying ""if you're being skeptical, you might get arrested."" I don't know what happened so that they don't want people to analyze it, but I'm curious now, imagine if American police started arresting everyone who says 9/11 was an inside job, or saying they didn't kill Ben laden, what they're saying is authoritarian madness, they don't understand that acting this way, they're basically creating more terrorists for themselves to fight ffs.

I believe it's pointing to the accusations posted on facebook and youtube towards the national guard's commander concerning the last anti-terrorism operation in sidi bouzid. Some well-known terrorists' sympathizers claim that this operation was orchestrated by the said commander in order to divert the public attention from the current protests and sit-ins.

Is this propaganda? No, this is a response to terrorist propaganda. The ministry of interior expressed it's concern about the spreading  rumors that pose a threat to national security and reminded the  people not to share unchecked claims that serve the cause of our  enemies, otherwise they may face legal prosecution, which is the obvious outcome. The question is, why is this announcement so vague and indirect ?! That is some serious issue begging for an explanation. ",2017-05-07 19:10:43

I wasn't arguing for or against. I was arguing for the right of a society to set societal norms in public and that this matter isn't religious coercion.

This is not a secular country, as stated in the constitution. So the judge was able to extend the meaning of this law to include eating and smoking in public like in this case. I believe this law also covers cases where people are walking around screaming obscenities.

That law should not have been interpreted  the way the judge did because there's also a part of the Constitution that says, **freedom of belief**, eating in public during Ramadan falls under that.",2017-06-03 19:32:07

Also don't forget the conspiracy theorists, that think Hillary is illuminati and voted trump because they were so sure Hillary will win, because that's the world order, just to troll, so yeah I have to disagree with you, I hope I made some good arguments.

Have we not seen the results of the ""grandiose projects"" that Arab dictators for last 50 decades have started and then they let them stagnate, adding yet another mechanism that drains taxpayer money in the absolutely horrendous and complex bureaucratic state machine?

=======
Do they start these things just to get the desperate people to applaud them for few days, and to appear as they ""are trying"" ?"" Because it seems so. All they do is ""claim fines"", ""claim taxes"", blah blah... At an age where the middle class is slowly eroding to join the poor class, and the rich class is entrenched in guarded habitations and private schools and boats away from the rest of the country that they just don't want to stop f****** with the state institutions, the banks, and the medias they own through their lackeys... Lackeys that keep stealing our funds, our continuous ""tax money"" gained at the expense of our mental and physical health, then they all blame it on ""Everything was better 20 years ago !! Everything was better 60 years ago !! /s""

 They most likely created these posts for some influent rich guy to play with authority. And then they blame our class for being lazy//corrupt//unpatriotic ... 

======
Just get your hands off from us already. You're the ones making everyone want to get out from here, to the point people risk their lives on make shift boats to escape this hell... Let us heal slowly from all the illness in our minds, do not complicate matters anymore by doing stuff nobody asked for.... Damn you those with power, you don't even want to be quiet and let us be our separate ways to escape your foolishness until we have to meet one of your uniformed thug called ""police"", you need to pretend to be ""good guys"" while your bank accounts take in the bribes from your ""benefactors""....

You don't do it to enjoy it, you do it to improve yourself, it's work, people who actually make their work into their hobby are really rare, not everyone will get the opportunity to do that, and your message here is destructive to most people, because again, people need motivation to push through them, and if you managed to find a sponsor aka parents, to let you study as far as masters, they probably would encourage you and help you go through a phd, the audience you're talking to, is probably not that worried about financial status, and money should not be your motive at this high level of education, you're already at the top, ""you can get the same jobs with a phd as without a phd"" I just googled -jobs that require a phd- and guess what? I got a load of them, I have no idea where you're getting your ideas from, please google what I posted and see for yourself, ""you can choose to work your first seven years with minimal income or working for three years in the industry and earn income free time and actually get benefits for working hard hours"", shouldn't you be saying this to 15 year old kids too? 'Hey kid dropout of your studies, you can be a carpenter right now and earn income free time and get benefits for working hard hours, or be a blacksmith or something', what's the difference in what you're saying from what I said? You should always tell people to go as far as they can, they can always fall back on other jobs, after the phd people can go back to get masters jobs, or be a carpenter, but people with masters can't get phd required jobs, ""phd people are cheap labor? Slave to their supervisor?"" Where's all this coming from? Do you have like a personal problem with a particular phd? ""It's not a good deal for you but it is for the university?"" Again how did you determine this? And again phd allows you access to another echelon of jobs and careers, again look at what I told you to google, ""from 100000 only 16000 can become professors"", yeah but there's still a ton of other jobs, again do some googling for god's sake, ""the only good paying job in academia, it's simple mathematics"" LOL ok, I'm gonna stop there, I'm sorry but this is painful, maybe you actually have a point, because universities are a terrible system that has been taking regressive measures for years now, but you present it awfully, you shouldn't discourage people, you're like an unmotivational speaker, this country is already full of people like that, we don't need more please, I hope your next video is not titled ""why you shouldn't get a masters degree"" lol, have a nice day.

That seems insane. Next time, please post those links in the description of the video, so that people can see where you're coming from, also I wanted to ask you something you didn't mention, if you don't pursue a phd right after your masters, let's say you took 5 years to work, have a kid whatever, can you comeback and pursue it later? That might be something worth mentioning. And actually, you didn't mention that some people, do a phd to advance at their jobs (I'm sorry I started watching videos about phds and got a very different views from the one you're expressing). I still don't agree with your video, if I were to make a video I would simply say, a phd is not for everyone, put a plan, see what you want for your future, if it requires you a phd to purchase what you need, do it, getting a phd is the same as anything else, it requires a certain type of person, and a certain kind of ambitions, also certain needs, as some people need it to advance at their jobs. But again as I said in the end of my first response, this time I actually watched videos on how bad the phd system is, it might be an idea for your next video, I mean I watched Elon musk say: getting a phd won't make you useful. My point is: for some people, a phd is crucial, for others it's not, for some people it fits their personality, for others it's the opposite, I think the best way to describe it is to say, a phd is like anything else, it needs reconsideration and a proper planning, that's all.

djrgvxa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/6kr3ij/,1,"hi, to be a resident in Tunisia you have to apply for a residence permit (basically you prove you have sufficient income, aka monthly wiring to your tunisian account). In order to buy an apartment you need to apply for a ""governor's permit"" as home ownership is restricted to tunisian nationals (it's even stricter for buying farms). 

On the second part, you can not have a car under an RS plate as that is a tax advantage only for tunisians living abroad. 

Depending on what you are planning to do in Tunisia, you can probably apply for similar advantages, you will need to ask a lawyer about that.

You can go for a Kaftaji or ""s'han tounsi"" or Lablabi as a small snack at any small restaurant as they are cheap yet signature Tunisian dishes.

I am sure you planned to visit the Bardo Musuem, it's a great place. You can visit the Medina as well but if you're from an Islamic country, you won't be impressed. 

Carthage has a wonderful historic site, it's mildly spacious but the entrance fee for tourists is 20dt, last time I checked, which is expensive in my opinion. You can also visit the old Punic ports near there for free. There's a fish museum next to them I think if you're into that.

I would try and cram everything into one day just so I can have an extra day at Hammamet, you'll be spoiled by the nice sea!

Have fun, good luck and asslema!",2017-08-07 19:52:50
dlaqr9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/6rzaci/,1,"Just read your edit. The money goes to the couple, how it's delivered will depend on the region, it can be during a party or just during a simple home visit.  It's not that big of deal, just laugh, try to turn down the money (they will insist) and thank them. Tunisians ladies are very touchy so be prepared for **a lot** of cheek kisses. 

Edit: oh and try to keep track of who gave how much! The giving back is not a strict rule but it's favorable, especially if it's close family. You won't have to pay back the exact same amount of money but something at least. I am sure you'll get used to this haha",2017-08-07 20:00:32

Downtown has plenty of restaurants, my personal goto is this one as it's not that expensive and the food is great, you must try the kouskous, brik, maybe escalope as a lot of foreigners are not familiar with it somehow. You can go for a Kaftaji or ""s'han tounsi"" or Lablabi as a small snack at any small restaurant as they are cheap yet signature Tunisian dishes.

Yep. And I'm from Istanbul, but the architecture looks very different so I'm sure I'll be impressed.

I mean, 20dt does sound expensive, but I don't think I'll have an opportunity to visit Carthage again, so I think I'll pay.

Shukran! (what's that in Darija? I did a semester of both MSA and French so I'll try to get by with a jumbled mix of MSA/French/English where my knowledge isn't enough in either, I hope that works haha)

dlul7j1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/6uoz5g/,1,"&gt; If they do find out the police will happily take bribes (smh)

I don't think this is a good advice. Especially as a foreigner, don't play the corruption game! Some (not all) of the officers are beginning to be wary of taking bribes what with the video evidence that surfaces from time to time that could cost them their jobs. You can actually get in trouble for trying to corrupt them. 

Most likely no one will find out. They usually don't look that deep into your stuff. If they find them, they'll most likely accept a sincere apology and confiscate the money. 200TND seems like a lot though, but at the same time, if you're taking only one example from each banknote in circulation, we're talking at least 115TND so I understand.. 

It's a risk for sure, but a very small one. Unless you're making it obvious you should be good.

Now it stated it wants to modify the new Constitution written after the revolution from the elected parliament, and Ennahdha the second biggest party can't do nothing about it except help the ruling party pass any laws it wants because if it resits and returns to the opposition it will be gutted like in the 90s from the usual old-regime/leftist alliance and democracy will be lost. So basically a second revolution, a more thorough one is needed.",2017-09-16 01:41:03

I can't take you seriously."" Haha don't worry, I don't act this way. Anyway, your video shows that there's an earnings gap, based on career choices women make, like I demonstrated to you before, in countries where they actually encouraged women to go into stem fields, they still didn't opt for those jobs, and they're completely free to do so, I mean there's still brilliant women in stem fields. Paying two people different wages based on gender is illegal, if you've been compensated unfairly, contact the labor board, because laws exist to protect you. Among millennials, the highest paid demographic are single females, because millennial women are earning way more college degrees than men, and are thus getting better paying jobs, mostly public school education produces more female graduates. There's an earnings gap, meaning all men put together earn more than all women put together, because men work higher paying jobs, more dangerous jobs and more hours, that's why you see the death during work percentage is like 98% males, and also a higher suicide rate among males. So how to fix the earning gap, go work a 99.9% male job like on an oil platform in frozen northern Alberta for 10 months straight. Also you can empower woman and tell them, if you want to make more money than men, don't have kids, which I honestly think it's a horrible thing to say, I mean what's wrong with earning less to have a miracle. So again we're gonna have to disagree, I don't see this as a problem that has a priority, over problems that are actually happening in third world countries, like my country, but it's okay.

Accomodation if you are willing to stay in a hotel i believe you can check online booking sites that should give you a good idea on how much it would cost. As for sightseeing the costliest thing would be transport, if you/your girlfriend has a car it would be much easier. Let’s say you’re visiting 3 places idk (sidi bousiid and umm idk the other places r a bit farther away) give it like a 300 dinar budget.

drifmir,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/74ayle/,1,"Don't Tunisian cops shudder when dealing with European passport holders? I was under the impression that, (not saying I am going to Tunisia with the intention of doing this, but) they'd be afraid of hassling a French citizen too much for fear of what the French government could do to their superiors, who would in turn drill them.

As far as reporting the police officers, if the police officers didn't do anything wrong and the couple had in fact kissed (hence, broke the law, not justifying it's stupidity, but laws are laws) then the cops wouldn't have increased charges and would have been able to fuck the couple up within the boundaries of the law

As for the couple, it was [these two](https://www.instagram.com/blame_me_love_/)",2017-12-20 07:27:28
drihi0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/74ayle/,1,"the stereotype is that they shudder in front of european passport holders but I've heard of enough stories to know that some at least don't fit that stereotype.



The charges I heard of were not just about a kiss. The officers said the couple were undressed and caught in the act because otherwise I think most cops wouldn't care if two people kissed in the dark. And the insults and supposed throwing of the passport in their face is probably what triggered them even more. I've heard couple of news reports that say the whole story about a kiss was a PR move to hide the fact that they were having sex and assaulting cops and that liberal media or activists used this case to argue for progressive laws about kissing in public and further attack islamic values in the country. 



But I haven't heard anything about this story afterwards and I don't know what's the truth. Usually cases take months for a trial. But I believe that some people used this story for a progressive agenda or to just cover for those two people because I've seen at least one author call for people to start kissing in public as a protest.",2017-12-20 08:40:38

I don't think you'll face any troubles unless the people doing this work are total scumbags with a criminal history. You should ask around about these people, preferably ask trusted people who won't then go and tell on you that you're snooping around. People do have reputations. 



Also keep your embassy in the loop about possible dangers and see what they can do for you. 




Usually people don't go to drastic measures to defeat the competition, all business people compete in the country afterall. Religious people (in the orthodox sense or just the popular simple sufi-infused sense) understand that rizq is in the hands of the provider.



I've heard about some issues of competition but they usually involve lawsuits or attempts at monopoly but never physical harm. But at the end, who knows? stay safe.",2017-12-20 09:07:42
