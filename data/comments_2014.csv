What was this guy doing there in Paris exactly? And is she planning on moving to Tunisia for good after they get married? If she is, she needs to know a few things: 

- Only 15% - 20% of the population can speak English. Unless you're going to a touristic areas (near hotels and resorts etc..) you're not gonna be able to communicate with most merchants, cab drivers, government workers etc..

- Marijuana is 100% ILLEGAL. Selling, cultivating, or trafficking marijuana can lead to 10 years in jail.

- Her ""crystal healing"" scheme won't earn her a single Dinar here

- Most of these marriages happen just because the unemployed Tunisian guy is sick and tired of living here and wants to move to the girl's country (""these marriages""=unemployed guy suddenly falls in love with foreign girl, usually older than him, and they decide to get married ASAP)",2014-11-26 15:23:37

cn1mjbs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/2pvm0z/,5,"&gt; especially that he wasn't in a position of power during Ben ali

Although I might be late to correct this mistake, Moncef Marzouki was [the president of human rights league](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligue_tunisienne_des_droits_de_l'homme) under ZABA and one of his main supporters during the beginning of his reign. 

Here is a link to a forum thread containing [some old newspaper articles](https://www.tunisia-sat.com/vb/showthread.php?p=1045264140) about Moncef Marzouki and ZABA. 

There is even one article written by Moncef Marzouki **himself** encouraging Tunisians to vote for ZABA: ""حتى تنجح التلميذة تونس بجدارة""

[This website](http://www.samibenabdallah.info/2012/04/23/la-verite-sur-les-3-mois-de-prison-de-moncef-marzouki-sous-ben-ali/) contained  many source materials proving how Moncef Marzouki became a professor (using his connections with ZABA) and why he was held prisoner in 1994 (Basically, he was running for presidential elections. In Arabic and French press, he said he was doing so to prove that we have real democracy in Tunisia and that anyone was free to run for presidential election if he was eligible to do so. However, he declared to a Spanish newspaper that he was running for presidential because there was no human rights in Tunisia. He was held for defamation).
This website was taken down two weeks ago. I am wondering by whom? However, here is a [cached version of this site](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:zydWb8YPMMoJ:www.samibenabdallah.info/+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=tn) if you want to read more about the subject.

Next time before you spread wrong information, please do your research thoroughly.

**N.B:** When I was searching google to write this answer, I noticed that many sites content has been altered in favor of Moncef Marzouki and that some other sites have been taken down. Moncef Marzouki talks about freedom of press and tries to alter his own history. What a scumbag!!!",2014-12-21 21:52:27

Alors je vais essayer de répondre à la plupart de tes questions mais pour ce qui est des loyers Je peux te recommender un autre site comme [celui-ci](http://www.tunisie-annonce.com/).

Pour ce qui est de la ligne de téléphone mobile, je pense que toutes les lignes disponibles en Tunisie sont sans engagement, vous n'aurez qu'à acheter une puce(carte SIM) et la recharger chez n'importe quelle epicerie mais vous pouvez aussi acquérir une ligne à facture, pour cette ligne je n'ai pas beaucoup d'information la concernant je vous laisse donc la tâche de chercher par vous-mêmes. 

Pour ce qui du meilleur opérateur, je ne peux pas les comparer mais voici quelques noms Tunisie Telecom, Tunisiana ou Orange.

Alors comment s'habillent les filles à Tunis? Et bien comme à Paris ou tout autre ville de France. Mais ça dependra ensuite de votre lieu de résidence, tout ce que je peux vous dire c'est que vous pouvez mettre tout ce que vous voulez du moins que ce ne soit pas trop osé.

ci5zti8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/27z6xv/,3,"I think the best way to do it is to always think about travelling as an adventure and that fear could come from both sides. A co-worker of mine went to California a month ago and was terrified at the thought of going to the USA alone for her vacation. She was scared at the thought that she would be around total strangers, that she could easily get lost , that there are so many criminals around who could rape/kill/rob. She was very excited at the thought of going there but very afraid of what she could be facing. Eventually, she had lots of fun and met great friendly people there. 

What I am trying to say is that fear is natural, but if you stay in your comfort zone you would never get to explore and adventure.

As long as you will be hanging around the right areas, that you will have a trustworthy escort/company, I think you will be fine. Try to get as much fun as possible. You will be meeting great people!

ci64ib8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/27z6xv/,3,"&gt;Would you recommend I go to Tunisia? 


Yes.
&gt;What should I expect when I get there?    

Tunisia from a geographical standpoint has seen a lot of  cultures come and go due to its position in the Mediterranean so there are a lot of ruins and landmarks (e.g. the biggest collection of mosaic in Bardo museum, the last Carthaginian city and a Colosseum).
   
I personally advise you to stay away from hotel food and eat out. Sure restaurant food isn't as good as homemade food but it's good enough as an insight to the culture, hotel food is dull and has no relation to Tunisian food except the bowl of harissa they put on the side and the occasional grilled salad. Try Tunisian fast food (tabouna, Brik, tunisian plate, lablebi ect ). go to the souk   the  closest one works well, but be careful the vendors in the souvenir selling parts can be really grabby sort of so have your friend with you at all times because you may get lost easily in the narrow passages, witch are a characteristic of tho old Tunisian architecture that exists in most big cities like Tunis and Bizerte and are a must visit.   
Do not fear diseases there are more than enough doctors in this country. Wash your hands regularly as usual and you're going to be fine.  

It is indeed the world cup season so expect all cafes with a functional TV that airs the world cup full during match hours. People would be too preoccupied to even think about kidnapping you.
   
Hope this helped. Have a nice trip and don't hesitate to PM me for any needed help.

I think you'll love it. The mentality of the people seemed very modern/western. Especially in the bigger touristic cities (Sousse and Tunis) a lot of things feel western. Now hopefully you'll stay with the family of said friend because in that case you'll have a blast. You'll get an inside perspective instead of doing the obligatory walk around the market beforing heading to the pool of your hotel. Which sadly seems to be what a lot of tourists do.

ci7czmj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/284gtf/,3,"We can't just make overall judgments on an aberrant case such as this one. Women are far from equality with males in the developed countries as well. The male and female wages disparities in the US for example or domestic abuse in the western world. There are certainly many gaps that are still to be brought out and solved for sure. But when it comes to the Tunisia or any other arabic country I still think that the matter goes in deeper since it is related to cultural and religious roots. The only way to change that is education.  

This man has done a horrible deed, the society would never accept something like this and will consider it as a crime. I am a Tunisian woman who grew up in a moderately open-minded family, we are not well off financially but my parents married each other out of love. I do think of myself as a person who has always been enjoying her freedom and has always had as many rights or freedoms as my brother had.

I remember though this one time that Dad saw me coming back from School with two male classmates/neighbors I was having my arms I think very close to their shoulders , almost like hugging, I was very young back then, maybe 8 years old or so and he told me this: "" Don't be leaning too much to guys, especially in public, walk straight and keep your head up, be friendly but not too friendly, it is for your own protection, your true friends are your pen and your Book, one day you will understand how important they are"". I think the way he reacted to it had a positive impact on his ""parenting"", he didn't push me to do anything behind his back and made me never fear his reaction because I knew that his love and acceptance were unconditional. I just knew then that he was putting me on the right track because he knows better given his experience. I am grateful for having a very special dad that way.

We already had meet ups, actually two of them already during the annual Global Reddit Meet up day, you can look up some of the pics posted on this subreddit for that matter. We also attended an event together which was a Zelda special symphony concert in June. 

As for stories about reddit and how amazing of a place it is, I was baffled by so many stories but have not really spoke of it to friends, I showed the website to some to see if they could be interested in joining, but I don't think that they were as nearly as interested as I was. 

Welcome again to this subreddit Tafcha! Hopefullly we will meet one day? ",2014-08-25 22:54:38

Before anything, welcome to /r/Tunisia /u/tafcha (and since I suck at arabic I don't even know what that means, even if I heard it a few times).

Not even there are country, town, state, etc.. subreddits, there are also [country circlejerks subreddits](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/25uswh/what_are_some_awesome_things_im_missing_out_in/chkyqzm) (which I personally find hilarious).

But wait, there is more ! Even if you must have stumbled upon the darker and/or unknown places of Reddit (according to your ""random subreddit policy""), if you like discovering new/interesting subs you can go to /r/wowthissubexists :)

As for this sub, /u/Enti_San (who is a mod of this subreddit, as you can see in the sidebar) pretty much explained everything, so I don't have much to add. Oh, and I unfortunately missed the meet-ups.

Cheers!

cmei6yx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/2nh5u5/,3,"First of all, Tunisia is far less worse than the impression you get by reading about it. Marijuana is indeed illegal, and punishable by law by one year in prison and around 300 dollars fine, but you can get around. Key is to keep a low profile on your consuming and not carry it around. 'nyways, it isn't our topic.  

However, the fact she's moving to another whole country with a guy she just met is alarming.  

 * Once the euphoria of ""an exotic culture that isn't rooted in consumerism"" will fade away, I'm not sure she's gonna like living in here, especially if neither her nor her husband have an over-decent income.

* She must be careful with her future husband's family. If she doesn't have money, she risks ending up being mistreated. (Nothing Hostel-like, but she won't find the company that pleasant.)

* Be careful of citizenship-diggers. It's sad, but most of my countrymen seek in fast marriages as a paved track to end up in a western country.  

My advice to you is to roll along, as the more you try to reason with her the more in love she'll think she is with the dude. Check on her on a regular basis, and be ready to pick her up from the airport, once she'll get a hold on reality.

It really depends on what your work is and what you are going to use the internet for generally.
Your best option though would be getting a 4mbps internet which might not be good to you ( depends on where you're from ) but it's good enough generally and quite stable.
I also think there are companies that have offers for temporary use (6 weeks in your case).
Just google these names and you choose for yourself :

Hexabyte

GlobalNet

Topnet


Edit: DO NOT GET A 3G INTERNET WHATSOEVER. You're gonna struggle with latency if that's something you're concerned about, it has countless other issues that i'm not going to even bother going through.

I've been living in Tunisia for 3,5 months now, and I work on the issue of parity, so I get to meet a lot of officials and civil society members and ask them questions about women in Tunisia. And almost every single one of them told me that there were no issue with women in Tunisia, no barrier to overcome, and equality of chances with men at birth.

That may be half true for a very small minority of well educated women who grew up in rich neighborhoods in progressist families. And still, their freedom is half the one men have (like in ""no walking in the street late at night, no dressing the way you want to, no smoking in public places etc.""). But poor Eya never had any kind of freedom, she was just a token of his father's honor, and trying to act like she was a normal human being, like being a woman was not the predeterminent that would decide all her life, killed her.

Face it Tunisian people : your country might be one of the most advanced in terms of women's right in the arabic world, but most of the population still has very retrograd mentalities regarding women, and there is still a lot of work to achieve in order to get closer to equality.",2014-06-14 12:42:54
ci7c77j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/27z6xv/,2,"First of all, the chances of you getting some tropical disease or being kidnapped are close to null :). You can be reassured about that.

I've been living in Tunisia for 4 months now and I would totally recommand that you visit the country! It has lots of beautiful places and landscape. I personnaly hate big hotels by the seaside with all comfort and pools, but if that's what you're into you can totally find that in Hammamet or Sousse. Personally I would recommand that you go in Tozeur (but it's getting very hot here in the summer) and visit the desert, hav a camel ride etc. Otherwise, there are some really neat roman ruins in Tunisia, my favorites are in Dougga (1,5 hours from Tunis by car/louage) and El Gem (more like 3 hours from Tunis).

Aside the tourist attraction, Tunisia is very different depending on where you go. Tunis is not that different from Europe and has all the noise and the mess of a capital city. Sousse is similar. It depends on where your friend lives. But anyway, food is good and cheap, you can find descent clothes for almost nothing in the market and fruits are cheap and amazing. 

Now something your need to be warned about : yes Tunisian are very nice, very helpful and polite and generous. But there are many, many rude boys on the street. If parts of your skin is showing, if you wear make-up, if you're blonde or just if you're a young girl, etc. You will be observed and catcalled. A lot.

BitCoin is still going strong (quickly check  r/bitcoin and you'll realize that + all the new businesses that are accepting payment with bitcoin and are very happy with it).

BitCoin has a very secure structure (namely the blockchain) that verifies each and every transaction  that happens on the network. 

I acknowledge that some have been victims of theft and lost their bitcoins. Most of them gave blinding trust to online wallets (coinbase for example which many discourage because they keep YOUR your private key to themselves and act like a traditionnal bank) and do not do backups for their private keys..

Bitcoin is now like the wild west, infrastructure is getting better and stronger as technology improves. I think BitCoin is a good investment.

With that out of the way, you could look into women rights. In the very new constitution, the state on one hand 'guaranties the equality between man and woman' but on the other hand is 'protector of the sacred' and 'Islam is the state religion'... in the Quran when it comes to inheritance or legally bearing witness a man is worth 2 women. 

Also the new constitution has something about the '[human] life being sacred' , that could be used to oppose abortion.

ci7d67q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/284gtf/,1,"Yes I agree with you, the western world still has a lot to work on about gender equality a well. And as you said, the matter of discrimination against women lays on deep rooted ideas conveyed by tradition and religion. And there are indeed women like you who had the chance to be given as much opportunities as their male counterparts.

But what really bothers me is how tunisian people act like ""the tunisian woman"" only needs hersalf to succeed, like she is in no way treated differently that men in society.

Another thing, but it seems that it does not really bother tunisian women (I myself found this scandalous) is like women have no access to the public space. The ratio of men to women in the street in something like 5/1, and gets close to 20/1 at night. There are no equivalent of popular cafés for women, where they could socialize with other people of their community, or just CHILL like men are doing all day long. I don't no, but it frustrates me so much to see how women's lives are so different to men's lves here. I believe that in order to be considered the same way (espacially in politics), they must have the exact same opportunities about everything during their lives. 

Not saying that you cannot have a good life when you are a woman and follow the traditions, it certainly please some women. But what if you want to do something else?",2014-06-14 14:04:48
ci7dfx7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/284gtf/,1,"Isn't that actually partially due to how men are in nature? Women are actually very hard workers, they/we already have their own private places to chill, where no men are allowed, have you ever been to a women's Hammam or to a Beauty Salon, some women spend hours just chilling, talking and taking good care of themselves, then they would do plenty of shopping, go to some nice cafés to chill, meet friends etc without having any social standards to ""respect"". Women do smoke/drink freely out in the cafés. I don't think that we really NEED to have a special popular women café to prove that we are equal to men. Take this for example,  a couple who are married, they don't always spend their time together right? The guy would most likely want to spend some time watching football with other guys, the lady will most likely go to a place where she could get her hair fixed, nails done then buying a nice dress. They probably do have different preferences but I can assure you most women would not want to spend their relaxing time in a place full of smoke and rubbish talk.

But there is a huge amount of things I observed and heard here that I could have never heard about being abroad, and I am giving my point of view about these facts.

Also, Eya's assassination is symptomatic of a certain view of what women are in the interpretation of the Kuran that is popular in the region.

I'm glad I went with my friend and stayed with his family though, I don't think I would have felt so comfortable if I was there on my own. I'm an American and my friend is half Tunisian (but can pass as full Tunisian) + everyone else we were hanging out with was Tunisian so.. I really stuck out like a sore thumb. If I was by myself I think I would have had problems, but because I was 1) with other men and 2) with people who look like they belong in Tunisia only one person ever gave me a hard time.

But the people were so great, the food was delicious, and the beaches were beautiful. It was a lot of fun to experience a culture so different from my own, and I plan on going back to Tunisia with my friend next year :)

Despite my irrational fear, I've always believed that people everywhere were mostly normal. Going to Tunisia definitely confirmed that for me. No one harassed me because of how I was dressed (well one guy, but he was a dick), no one tried to kidnap or rape me, no one tried to recruit me to some crazy extremist cult, or any of the other 1,001 terrible things the media told me would happen. I went, I had a lovely trip, met some great people, and ate delicious food :)

10/10, would definitely go again!",2014-07-28 01:22:35
cj9stzg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/2bslha/,1,"Based on what economic theory does a currency increase in value, just because it is used somewhat more frequently or by a larger number of people?

If you want to profit from a rise in popularity, you have to invest in a company that does something Bitcoin-related - mining is probably a bad choice, so something else - or start one yourself. Simply buying some Bitcoin is not gonna do the trick, I would not expect more than the rate of inflation in fiat terms there.",2014-07-28 06:07:04
cja9g2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/2bslha/,1,"I do not claim to be an expert in economics, neither did I study economics in high school. But I look up internet for information and that's my main source.

One of the factors for a currency increase in value is the network used by it. Now let's take the example of Facebook. Imagine if there were only 3 users connecting to it, how much value will those people give it ? Practically none, because it is hard to convince more people to join etc.. It reminds me of Google+ and how little users use it (it has grown mostly because Google is forcing people to use it (by welding Youtube accounts with Google+ for example)
Now that's the same for BitCoin. The Bitcoin was practically valueless in the beginning, valuing some $0.1 at most. But since more people joined, and more services were accepting bitcoins, more people gave it value and had faith in it therefore joined. And it is reflecting on the exchange rate now (1BTC~594USD)

And that is without taking account all the other benefits of BitCoin, whether it is speed of transactions, the anonymity, the decentralization etc..

BitCoin is no different than fiat currency in the sense that one is digital, the other is analog. For those who say bitcoins cannot be backed by gold, how is that true ? I can right now purchase some gold with my bitcoins and keep it in a safe then sell it whenever I like.

cjaenuz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/2bslha/,1,"I don't think you can base the price increase of Bitcoin, over that time, on fundamentals.

The network is certainly one factor for a ""small"" currency, but after a certain point, the effect of this on value levels off. I think Bitcoin might already be past that point.

Think about this: There is no reason why it wouldn't be possible to have 10x, 100x, or a 1000x of the current activity in BitCoin, while still having the same exchange rate to the Dollar. (Or even a lower rate to the Dollar, actually.) 1 BTC just needs to be ""flipped"" more often, for that to happen.

&gt;
The __Foucault pendulum__ (English pronunciation: /fuːˈkoʊ/ *foo-__KOH__*; French pronunciation: ​[fuˈko]), or __Foucault's pendulum__, named after the French physicist [Léon Foucault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9on_Foucault), is a simple device conceived as an experiment to demonstrate the [rotation of the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation). While it had long been known that the Earth rotates, the introduction of the Foucault pendulum in 1851 was the first simple proof of the rotation in an easy-to-see experiment. Today, Foucault pendulums are popular displays in science museums and universities.

Well since the only relative i have abroad is my 70yo unclein france , i doubt that he'll know what Steam is when i'll mention it ...

So i had to find other alternatives to get some games:

[r/FreeGameFindings/](http://www.reddit.com/r/FreeGameFindings/) It's mostly indie games but sometimes big titles drop to 0.00$ in price like Dragon age : Origins (Origin), Payday:The Heist (Steam) in october , and my favourite Battlefield 3 (Origin) last summer ... and last year Valve gave away Left 4 Dead 2 for free during Christmas 

[r/GameDeals/](http://www.reddit.com/r/GameDeals/) this one requires some luck, when a new Humble Bundle comes along people will give the extra games they bought (the ones they already have but got them anyway in the bundle) , they put down the link and first come first get , the only problem is there are a lot of lurkers there which makes your chances of getting one smaller. I got Insurgency latemy from there.

And here's my [steam Id](http://steamcommunity.com/id/recan) if you ever want to add me
