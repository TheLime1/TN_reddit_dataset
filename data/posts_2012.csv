I'm a ProductDesign student who has been given a project involving your country. 

* It is to design a device that will enable someone to move from a wheelchair to a bed on the floor. 

* We were advised to not rely on electricity and it is something that should be made in a local workshop. 

Can any of you give me any advice on how reliable electricity is? or what materials are easily obtained ?
