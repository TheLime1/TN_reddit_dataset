And my dad is working in the  finance filled as a tax inspector (so i couldn't argue a lot with him) he told me that they are overall bad for the economy 
mainly i got these arguments or some variation of it 

+ Not paying taxes 

+ Getting المواد المدعمة that are covered by tax money 

+ Public transport that is also covered by tax money 


&gt; So not paying taxes and getting products/services covered by tax money which are supposed to go to the people who pay taxes aka citizens


But he acknowledged that they have some benefits mainly

+ They work jobs tunisians usually don't do

+ And they accept any amount of paying so they make production cheaper

So my question here, are they that bad for economy cause i really don't see them as that mush of a problem and can I get some arguments to defend my position ?",,,,,,2022-01-02 21:02:38

s3ccyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/s3ccyd/does_the_tunisian_society_repress/,5,Does the Tunisian society repress uniqueness/diffrence?,"I am going to state the obvious to start off , which is the way people have been treating anyone comes up with any fashion style thats a bit unusual and how they get ridiculed and sometimes harassed for their taste .
Not to mention of course the ideological and religious repression that forces many to be afraid of sharing their thoughts and perception to everything . Also i seem to notice how many talented people in fields that aren’t very “mainstream” or “cool” (programming/philosophy /language/academic intelligence at some points/writing…. To state some examples i ran into)are forced to give up on their passions because of the way others from family to school and everyone around them  treat their talents and basically make them feel like those things they worked hard on or hold big value to them are worthless. 
From my perspective i see this as a result of how we tend to not like the fact that someone is better than us at something , gets attention for those things or if that thing goes against the way we were raised .
The problem with this situation though is how i see it as the major reason why a lot of tunisians that we hear are excelling at something that isn’t common tend to disappear from that field shortly after or at least they don’t get the attention they diserve that and of course the number of wasted talents and mental issues resulted from crumbling under the pressure of being unique in Tunisia.
I would like to hear what you guys think about this topic while keeping in mind that all i said is heavily generalized and subject to exceptions as well as it being my Own interpretation without any hard evidence .",,,,,,2022-01-13 23:04:11

Living abroad or traveling can be a rich and awesome experience that can change your life if you know how to deal with it. I feel like most of tunisian's that went abroad they have no ideas why they even went abroad ( habit nokhrej w barra tounis ki zebi) they spend 4 years of their lives studying some major that they have no idea about having a small tunisian circle of friends to hang out with smoking most of the time and watching choufli hall and just waiting for the summer vacation. We are so numbed with the idea of living abroad that we forgot that we can actually live here and fight for it. And I feel that with better living conditions most people we'd rather live here in tunisia than anywhere else. I gave up on living abroad just so I can go after my dreams here with little to no resources and even if things didn't go as planned I'll know that at least I  tried. I might seem a bit naive or over-optimistic but I do have faith in this generation that it can achieve great things and make a huge step forward with this country.",,,,,,2022-01-13 23:49:36

* Tax payers money is not charity to pay for dysfunctional and unneeded public companies ( Tabac company ??) --&gt; Massive reduction in public workforce and expenditure. People won't die from hunger because of the basic income.

I present to you, the magnificient seven of r/Tunisia :

1. **The internet patriots:** These are the future building blocks of Tunisia, they are working on a revolutionary technology that allows them to fix the country while sitting on their ass, pretty innovative, right? they just have to propose or ask for solutions to improve or fix certain things in the country on this sub, then kickback, relax, and hope these solutions will be applied automatically out of thin air, and they sure will! impressive! :-)
2. **The deep thinkers:** These people want to take advantage of their freedom the way it should be done, and what better way to do that than going out naked? or have sex with your partner's bestfriend while your partner is having sex with your sister? these folks have very high self-esteem and no taboos, this is why they constantly want to display and brag about their taboo-free lifestyle to acquire validation, the commodity of the 21st century. :-)
3. **The tubes:** These are trashed encyclopedia britannicas reincarnated in the form of humans, inferior people like us have to shut up when the tubes talk so we can absorb their knowledge and wisdom so we can be qualified to help internet patriots make this country a better place.
4. **The people who answer questions to say they don't know the answer:** These people are the most reliable when you need help, let's say you're lost in a desert and you're looking for water to survive, ask these people for help, they will answer to tell you that you can't find water in the desert which is a very useful answer of a fact you would never know without their valuable intervention. I would call these the tubes++.
5. **The sextoy hunters:** These people would do the impossible to find a sextoy in Tunisia, inserting a rubber object into their apertures will solve their life problems. Life is short to insert awkward objects in your apertures folks, be like the deep thinkers, enjoy unstructured and unapproved sex with everything that moves.
6. **The amazigh:** These are people who are the proudest of their origins, they are proud to the point that they want to remind themselves and other people about it in every thread and comment. 
7. **The Facebook immigrants:** These are toxic people who immigrate from Facebook to Reddit claiming that it's less toxic on here. Perfectly understandable.",,,,,,2022-01-14 14:45:35

Personally as someone who smokes weekly and uses hard drugs (lsd/ecstasy/candyflipping) occasionally as well as drink from time to time i understand why this law has been in place for hard drugs but i cant wrap my head around how weed is included in it especially when alcohol is legal since weed is less addictive , has way less severe side effects with a 0% mortality rate and a much more safe and relaxed effect that and the many more utilities that plant can provide.

To me these people need to grow up and learn that actions have consequences . Its honestly insane how easily they make decisions that can impact the rest of their lives for example it seems like its a new trend for 14-16 years olds to have tattoos and trust those tattoos are usually meaningless and for some reason they its a good idea to have them on their necks,faces and hands AKA the hardest places to cover it makes me wonder if they realize its going to stick with them for the rest of their lives and of course we have the edgy atheists for no reason and without any research along the self diagnosers for real if you are going threw a tough time it doesn’t mean you are mentally ill . My problem with this is how it devalues the importance and the symbolism behind these things or even insults the people who put their minds and souls into these subject or actually suffer from them. My point is , please think before you act or say something .


Edit: thanks to everyone who commented i got to learn about different prospectives and changed my mind about a few things .

YES! اعملو طلة tunisianloverats .com  and you may find  your ""baznes"" friend listed there.

  
A friend of mine was trying to flirt with this German girl and she asked him where he is from. When he told her she replied with ""LOL"" and ghosted him.

So I'm asking you, begging you, to suggest any solution, no matter how bizarre it may sound. I just wanna get rid of this incurable Satan who is haunting my scalp and depriving me from growing my hair or cutting it, peacefully. I am this close from burning my head.

I'd like to buy some as a gift where I just can write a title on it on the outside, hence it doesn't matter if it's fake or doesn't work, and assuming fakes are much cheaper if they exist. 

For context, to those of you who are familiar with brooklyn99 and ""title of your sextape joke"", I want to gift such video casettes with every joke title on one of them (it's getting redundant here sorry!)   


 So it's fine as long as the item in question looks like a video cassette, and I can write/stick something on it!  


[Exemple](https://st.depositphotos.com/3160975/4058/i/950/depositphotos_40582351-stock-photo-old-vhs-video-cassette-tape.jpg) but not necessarily identical

How could you support someone that aggressive in her speech, okay I get it we want to get rid of the Islamists but sorry she's not the one to do it, I don't see any difference between her, Nahdha or Makhlouf's party they both insulting each other such using different arguments (being Fascists), also her past with the old regime is mortifying. She has been at the parliament for two years, I can't find anything good to mention what she did except doing Lives on Facebook and filming others without their approval. I hope the young generation is not supporting this kind of politicians (including Nahdha and Makhlouf's party), her supporters are just as bad as her saying something you don't like about her makes you an Islamic or Nahdha supporter like you can't oppose her.  

 I just wrote here because I wanted  to share my opinion about her here because I think Reddit community is more mature than Facebook's community and less toxic, seeing her growing is terrifying how could you support or trust someone like her?",,,,,,2022-01-20 09:09:19

My question is as simple as:

Is there a law that allows me to take the nationality of my father (In this case he is French) in Tunisia? If so, how is it done?

&amp;#x200B;

(Last time this Thread got taken down for literally no reason whatsoever).

&amp;#x200B;

As far as I've read on Wikipedia, it says:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French\_nationality\_law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_nationality_law)

&gt;French citizenship by birth abroad to at least one French citizen  
&gt;  
&gt;=&gt;The child (legitimate or natural) is French if at least one parent is French.

This gave me the idea to create a subreddit dedicated to Tunisian History which will allow our hidden gem of a country to get the attention it deserves.

r/TunisianHistory

Will serve as the main place for Tunisian historical posts that will also be crossposted to the adequate subreddits.

But for that to happen I need your help

1. For moderation
2. For quality posts.

If you have any good pictures/videos/stories of/about Tunisian art, artefacts, historical places etc please help out by posting them. If you have any good media that is not OC just be sure to mention the source in the comments.

My neighborhood is situated between the said central and a new in-development land where the government is planning big tech/industrial/medical projects.   


Tunisie Telecom started linking this new zone with fiber optics underground cables and although we won't get fiber optic home terminals (for free at least) our landlines got connected to a local hub (cabinet like 50m from my house) that will assure the last mile over optics.   


All good and swell until شباب الحي noticed that the cables being installed are thicker than the usual landlines.

  
And in pure Tunisian fashion at 2AM, they unearthed the cables (from hub to hub) thinking they will make bank selling the copper.  When they found ""العصبة"", they destroyed the 2 fiber optic hubs.

&amp;#x200B;

After 2 days without service, we got a temporary fix with some mediocre equipment. The connection is now intermittent, unreliable and the ping fi السماء.

Today, furious,  I went to the main TT branch and got a ""complaint receipt"" so I can go to the central.

  
The technicians were understanding told me that my whole ""district"" is officially screwed.

One of them showed me the initial damage assessment report:  6.000.000TND

I've been reading online that it is very important to establish physical chemistry early on while dating through touch and especially kissing ,  to not fall in the ""friendzone"" and make your intentions straight. but does the same advice apply here in Tunisia since it is a taboo subject?

Im currently dating a girl who i really like and i have the intention of having a relationship with her(  we only had one date) and im genuinely anxious about applying this and making the situation awkward and her uncomfortable. How should i deal with this ? And if the same advice apply how early on while dating should i do this ? 
Thank you in advance and i'm sorry if i've made anyone uncomfortable while reading this.",,,,,,2022-01-25 17:47:06

Yesterday, I came late to the school and I couldn't find my class and one of the supervisors gave me a wrong direction so I got lost and missed the first hour of my two hour class, so when I finally found it in the second hour I tried explaining it to the professor but he insisted on an entry card (بطاقة دخول) so I just left with an angry face and closed the door without arguing any further but right before I exit the school's gate my classmate came to me telling me that the Professor told me I can come back but I'm still pissed so I told him to not tell him that he found me and just tell him that you couldn't find me and left.

Hours later, I receive a Facebook message from one of my other classmates who told me that our teacher told them to inform me that he is going to send me to the disciplinary board (مجلس التأديب) but didn't tell me for what reason, I asked another one who wasn't there when I was at the class and told me that he is doing it for insulting him and closing the door violently which are complete blatant lies and I'm pretty sure that the whole class can testify with me on that, not to mention that I never got expelled or received a warning in my entire life so it should be really weird to look at how I received my first expulsion in the first year I study under this Professor and in fact, since the start of this school year I felt that he was always waiting for this moment, he commented few times on how I close the door but no one else said anything about it, he keeps complaining about me from time to time but I never thought he would go any further and I've a feeling that he wants me out of the school for life.

Anyways, I'm just telling you all this just to give context to why I'm asking this because I'm really ignorant about all the disciplinary stuff but I had many friends who dealt with it and I've always hated the system for its cruelty and giving absolutely no regard or dignity to students, I fucking hate it and I think no one should be expelled permanently, I think no matter how severe student's crimes can be he should be always given a chance to do better and fix his mistakes and be given a chance to graduate from high school normally like everyone else.

So I'm currently absent and don't plan on bringing my parent and getting an entry card any time soon, so what's the process of expelling a student ? Do I have to be at school to sign something or would I receive a message ? And let's assume I will get expelled permanently, Can I continue my education at a private school or does the expulsion includes all kinds of schools ?

Edit : I forgot to mention that he could use some facts about me to get me expelled which are :

1- I got 5/20 for the first trimester mark.

2- I was ""illegally"" absent for long time.

3- I was ""illegally"" absent in most exams.

4- I always come late to the class.

5- I forged an entry card recently and I don't know if they found out about it or not.

6- I never worked in class and I don't even have a copybook.",,,,,,2022-01-26 10:37:31

What are the legal actions that should be taken in order to protect, copyright and declare my work so that it causes no harm to me, my working team or the audience itself? Are there any guidelines out there that should be read before commiting to movie/short movie creation in Tunisia?

I know it's too much, I kept looking around the internet for so long, watching videos that some were often misleading of a sort. I even asked Multimedia college students and professors that all misguided, even confused me more than I am confused.

I'm still reeling a bit from my internship search. Hundreds of applications didn't get past the initial screening. The only interviews I've sat for I landed through third party referencing (Prepa and School Alumni I reached out to helped). So my main assessment is that it's nigh impossible to even get your foot into the interview booth with just my Tunisian degree (and Tunisian address because not everyone is willing to sponsor an intern). Which is kinda depressing. 

I was lucky to land a graduation internship in France. But my overarching goal is to move to an English speaking country. That's just the language I'm most comfortable with. The plan was to work towards the UK, but US wages in Tech (Software Engineering, ML and Cloud) just seem too enticing (terrible work culture aside). It seems like a pipe dream still.

My point is, if it's hard to get a job (Entry Level to Junior) in **Europe**, without falling for the local degree -&gt; European master/PhD pipeline, then how much more difficult is it to get a job in North America? **Any Tunisian Engineers in North America can share their experiences?**",,,,,,2022-01-27 20:39:52

The music of the old Bourguiba era anthem was way more epic.

We have been working behind the scenes to introduce new strategies and open more doors to every gamer in north africa , in any game he/she likes. We are truely aiming to build a community where gamers belong and their voices are heard and fight the toxicity that exists.

We did get some support since the last post and i appreciate it ! 

Now we are on facebook and instagram to get closer to everyone and hopefully gain their trust and support !

so i would love if you join us , we are still small but lets grow the community together !

After that i took such a beating that a little blood came out of my nose and i got kicked out of my home and my mom said she was going to drop me off school. The only reason why i'm back home and why my mom didn't drop me out is because my aunt told her to give me another chance. In my old post you guys gave me advice on how to study and i followed it and i haven't gotten any progress. And i followed my teachers advice and i still didn't get better. And i know for a fact that if i don't convince them that im special ed and that i need special kind of tutoring i will fail my year again wich will my family forcibly drop me out of school and i won't have any education or future.

Pour les personnes qui cherchent à faire une reconversion vers l'informatique, voici une formation que j'ai donné gratuitement avec l'institut ISSAT Kasserine pendant les 2 derniers mois.
Cette formation présente certains concepts fondamentaux dans le marché du travail: API, REST, SOAP, JSON, XML, Bases de données relationnelles (index, transactions, ACID...) et enfin Elasticsearch lui même. 
L'idée est que cette formation soit accessible à toute personne sans connaissance préalable du domaine. C'est pour ceci que j'ai omis pas mal de détails théoriques (et parfois techniques). J'ai compilé une petite liste bibliographique contenant certains cour très connus à l'échelle internationale comme le CS50 et les cours de Andy Pavlo (bases de données). 
J'espère que ça changera la vie d'une personne au moins 🙏

First off, I loved your country! The people were so friendly and the sites were incredible. I had an amazing time…an underrated gem for sure.

I have a few questions about the modern culture of Tunisia. 

I hope none of these questions come across as offensive or closed-minded. I am just trying to learn more about how things work and expand my understanding, and these are things I was curious about but I couldn’t ask anyone there.

&amp;#x200B;

* Tunisia seems to be one of the most progressive Arab countries I have been to. From what I’ve been told, women either wear a hijab or don’t …it’s a personal decision and it’s not frowned upon at all to not wear one. Is this true? I noticed that the younger women also were dressed very casual, some even showing more skin than I’ve seen in other Arab countries. Has it always been like this? Or would you say it’s a change that is more recent (within the last decade or so)?
* I’m curious about the role of men versus women from a cultural perspective. Are most households dual earners with both men and women working? Or is it mainly the men who work and the women stay home? Are things mostly equal? I’m contrasting this to other Arab countries I’ve visited, as it seems like Tunisia is quite different.
* I was mostly in the well-traveled parts of Tunis, so I didn’t go to any of the poorer areas. But even when driving through many different parts of Tunis, I didn’t see many homeless people at all. Is homelessness not a big issue in Tunisia? It’s a big problem in my home country so it was interesting to not see many homeless or beggars.
* Was daily life very different before Arab Spring? If so, how has it changed?
* What is the main economy in Tunisia? What sort of jobs do people out of college get? Is there much job opportunity in Tunisia?
* English speaking: some people said everyone learns English at school and speaks it, but then I would meet people younger than me who didn’t speak any English at all. Just curious if English learnings is based on if you went to public vs private school or something else?
* What is the biggest problem in Tunisia right now? For ex, in the US our current biggest problems are probably around healthcare or racism.
* I’m curious what Tunisian people honestly think about their country. I’m sure it’s varies a lot. Just trying to understand the general feeling people have towards Tunisia there. 

Thank you very much and thank you for having me in your lovely country!",,,,,,2022-02-08 01:55:47

My fiancé and I are traveling to Tunisia from Montréal later this month. Our itinerary has us in Tunis for a few days, then Djerba, then a Sahara tour, and then back in Tunis to close it all out. We'll be in the country for ten days total. 

I've got a couple specific (maybe weird?) questions that I'm hoping you could answer. Any tips would be massively appreciated.

1) Places to see live music in Tunis. In particular, I'm a huge fan of Anouar Brahem, the Tunisian oud player, so traditional music would be amazing. But any music really (assuming the pandemic hasn't shut all that down).

2) Seafood restaurants in Tunis or Djerba. Not looking for anything fancy, but ideally somewhere that serves octopus. Love octopus.

3) Somewhere where I can buy or develop 35mm film. I'll be taking photos during the trip and would prefer to have them developed in Tunis rather than risk the negatives being scanned at the airport. Somewhere that sells old vintage cameras would be a bonus!

4) Places to buy vinyl records?

5) Tips on getting a PCR test done in Tunis. I tried using the booking website but it seems like we need to either call or visit in person, rather than book online. If anyone can point us to the a reliable testing centre in Tunis it'd be super helpful.

4) And just food recommendations in general, or places in Tunis and Djerba that you think fly under the radar. Or general travel tips/precautions that we should know.

Thanks so much!",,,,,,2022-02-08 20:29:25

I live in France and I will soon come to Tunisia to do a remote internship, but more importantly, I'd like to come to Tunis to learn dialectal&amp;modern standard Arabic. The problem is that I am a bit anxious about the idea of being judged because I have myself Algerian roots and I can barely speak Algerian Arabic.  Usually when I go to Algeria to see my family, I can somehow manage to make myself understand, but regarding Tunisia it's totally different because I will be alone. I'm actually scared not to have any friends, or to be judged by the elders as some kind of fake North African who can't even speak the language of his ancestors. 

My question is the following: Will I have to face remarks from the people of Tunis about the fact that I cannot speak Arabic despite being myself North African? I really have bad memories about younger me going to Algeria and being mocked by my cousins' friends about my poor Arabic skills, and I'd like to avoid that as much as possible.

Years of paralysis, corruption, declining state services and growing unemployment had already soured many Tunisians on their political system before the global pandemic hammered the economy last year   

This 2022 Tunisian Parliament Speaker Rached Ghannouchi was accused of Having an invisible arm behind the persona of    Najeh Hajj Latif outside and inside Tunisia accusing him of managing suspicious financial relations with the Renaissance Movement, these accounts showed documents proving that Latif uses two financial accounts into which huge funds are pumped from the Qatari Emiri Diwan, and that the sums placed in these accounts have no return for them which raises suspicion about them.  sums exceeded, in total, 30 million euros, to be withdrawn in Qatar in cash and transferred to Tunisia, to be entered through the protocol hall at Tunis-Carthage Airport, in cash as well, and spent outside the control of the state  These data have become available to Military Intelligence, and one of the parties that have been briefed on them is the Presidency of the Republic. 

Evidence proves that  Rashid Ghannouchi is involved in crimes and Latif is one of the main keys and also the accusations involved in the cases of the assassination of Chokri Belaid and the Involvement of Qatar.",,,,,,2022-02-11 03:41:29

So 1st of all I was under a SIVP contract so I can leave whenever I feel like it without giving any notice.

I ve been working in a startup for 6 months. Well actually not working. The correct term would be a slave. We were 2 software engineers getting slaved non stop by our boss. Of course my colleague didnt mind it because he was close with the boss.
So any ways, I was always at work at around 8:30 am. I do my 8 hours and just when I m about to leave my boss calls us for a meeting. He sometimes keeps us late at night at around 10~11 pm. He also calls us on weekend to come and work. And ofc u guess it there s no bonus. Just the salary which wasnt even great.
So last monday after getting paid and getting my work certificate, I went to my boss s office and I told him I m quitting. And the 1st thing he said to me that he s going to sue me for leaving because since I already came in I must finish the month. I told him I didnt use my vacation time so count the rest of the month as vacation and I left while he was still nagging and cussing me.

Ps: my colleague was furious at me because I told him he was beeing used too",,,,,,2022-02-11 11:32:22

First-time travel to Tunisia in May of 2022. I'm a freelance writer and novelist and am looking to bolster the authenticity of my book (time-travel sci-fi to the period of the 1st Punic War, ICYI). But, anyhow...

I'll be staying in Tunis. Carthage, Bardo, Tophet, Punic Harbor, (and yes, Roman Baths even though it's outside of period), are all on the menu. Nosh nosh. These'll be self-guided.

I really want to see Kerkouane though too. However, for that, I'd really feel more comfortable if a graduate-level archeology or PhD knowledgeable in this site first, and Carthaginian culture second, could accompany and guide me.

The bona fides and due diligence met, I'd be willing to pay, of course,

Any takers? Advice?

Thanks!

PS: In my novel, I plan to paint the Carthaginian/Phoenician culture in all shades (from what we best know) both the good and the ill, including child sacrifice. That being said, however, aside from the Hannibal fanboys, the varied cultures of North Africa have been painted in a negative light for far too long, as has much of Africo-Meghrebi society.

I studied Arabic at university, and I speak Tunisian dialect (although not bel gdé bel gdé 😅) and I just love Tunisia. I have a few questions, first being, how much would I need to save out for rent (if I were to rent let's say s+0 or s+1 in Sousse for example) and what would be the best place to look to rent an apartment for 2 - 3 months (June, July and August; and not expensive stuff like AirBnb..). Also, since I'll be working online, is there a way to get a good, steady internet connection, because last time I had Orange and it wasn't really good (that was 2019 though). Any help, suggestions are welcome.

I am not looking for a resort. Two more factors are the need to use Internet (I am a PhD student in the dissertation writing stage. Perhaps I could just use my mobile as a hotspot) and the fact that I do not plan on driving, so I would need an area where I can live by walking around, and which I could also reach by louage (for example).

I will be traveling from Austria. I know a small amount of rusty French and a little fusHa (but no Amiya) but am willing to learn and practice during my stay.

I would deeply appreciate any guidance you could provide.

Alternatively, I would not be opposed to renting a flat in a city, provided places of interest and character are nearby, but I do not know how to look for such places. A lot of what I see while searching online tends to be oriented towards those who are looking for rentals in resort areas, or hotels, but I am looking for small accommodations for one person to stay for a medium term (e.g., two months).",,,,,,2022-02-16 06:28:12

Short summary, if you are too lazy to watch the video: A group of guys want to rob the bank. Each of them gets a nickname e.g. 7ai el Nasr, Kabbaria etc. 
7ai el Nasr argues because he doesn't want that name but agrees with it at the end, more or less. In the ""bank"" an employee laughs at him because ""You want to rob a bank with the name 7ai el Nasr?"" He loses his shit and exposes everyone  by taking his and their maskes off, telling their private information etc.

So what is so bad about حي النصر that he felt so insulted about it? Why did he want to be named كباربة instead?",,,,,,2022-02-17 18:43:14

Activities to do with others:

\*Camping

\*Escape rooms

\*Takssir room (the name is pretty explicit: you get protective clothing and goggles, you enter a room with plenty of easily breakable objects, and you release all your frustration on those poor little objects.

\*Scuba diving:

It's maybe not the best spot in the world, but it's really fun and the monitors were serious.""

"" Tabarka: [the Diving Center](https://www.facebook.com/etoile.de.mer.tk/) ""

\*Climbing gym (Marsa: [https://www.facebook.com/ClimbInTunisia/](https://www.facebook.com/ClimbInTunisia/))

Dear Tunesians,

I am a European and I want to travel to Tunisia (and possibly even live there for a while).

Yet, I have some **rare** auto immunity disorders that prevent me from getting \*any\* additional vaccines. I have a basic (although not recently updated) immunization for Diphtheria-Tetanus and Measles. However, as I said, due to my specific illness, I cannot get any additional vaccines.

I am not really worried about Hepatitis A as it's usually mild and well treatable.

**However, I wonder how common Typhoid, Polio, Pertussis and Hepatitis B actually are in Tunesia?** I ve been travelling in many European countries, including Eastern Europe and Southern Europe, and the US without issues in the past 5 years. Are these illnesses much more common in Tunesia than in Europe? Does anyone know where I find information about that?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks a lot!",,,,,,2022-02-26 23:17:21

t2nkgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/t2nkgt/i_feel_that_i_might_not_get_a_job_after/,21,I feel that I might not get a job after graduation (software Engineering),"Hello fellow Tunisian redditors, I'm a 3rd year ENSI student aka future computer science engineer and I have big concerns that I might no be able to get hired for a job after graduation inchallah

I'd like to hear ur opinions and advice on this subject

I'd like to share with you my educational parcours so you can have a good insight before throwing ""its easy bro, just improve forehead kekw"" or ""no honey, it's just imposter syndrome""

It's going to be a long post, so hold with me here or I will just provide TLDR but I'd urge you to go through it especially if you are familiar with the computer science.

TLDR:

studied prepa then ENSI, brainlessly succeeded 3 years without developing skills that can get me hired, struggled to find internship cause I didn't know any technology asked for by companies, found internship at a not so good start up and I'm afraid I won't be able to find a job later on because despite trying to develop skills, I just can't.

Full Story:

I studied prepa and got intro ENSI because that was the ""best"" school my score enabled me to get into, it's not like I wasn't into computer science but my expectations were completely unmet.

Here's how 3 years at ENSI went:

I think the problem is the mentality with which I approached the whole thing, I just wanted to succeed, not caring about having ""bonne formation"" and developing my skills

I just wanted to get over with the subjects and that's it, and it's not like I just worked for the bare minimum, I had 14 moyenne while we just need 8 to succeed in each subject so you can see I did put effort in that.

1st year was full of ""useless"" subjects

I mean i recognize how important probability, electronics, etc... but I see them as useless now

at the time of studying them, contrarily, i found them so interesting and excelled at them but now that I think about them, none of these subjects benefited me in anyway, rarely do I need them and even when I do, it's just a matter of a basic notion

2nd year we did study useful subjects like Genie Logiciel ( **project management and software development** )

I chose spécialité  ""data science &amp; computer vision"" because it was hyped and always heard that in the upcoming years will be sought after.

At the end of the second year, I became somewhat aware of my bad situation when i had to find a summer internship but I didn't have anything to put in my CV. All I knew was basic stuff we got taught like HTML, CSS, JS, PHP (no knowledge of their frameworks or the fact they even existed, I genuinely thought for a long time that developers would write raw HTML CSS JS in their code)

I lied, I listed technologies I had no idea about and lied about personal projects and stuff , just downloaded some GitHub repos, understood them a bit and called it a day (the only real project I had is a game on java that I developed following ytb video literally line by line)

and lied about my extracurricular activities and pretended to have participated in hackatons and clubs.

and despite all that I didn't get a single response for an interview.

Despite the fact that my whole profile was a lie, it still didn't attract people, I felt so bad.

but no worries I found a ""paid internship"" (formation Flutter + internship)

I was asked to develop a simple mobile app, the idea of creating a whole app from scratch was overwhelming for me so I just copied a github repo , modified it a bit and added few functionalities that I was asked to do and were not present in the project I copied, and I spent the internship understanding the github code and trying to modify/add to it without breaking it aka I wasn't developing during the internship but rather rectifying a code, it's like copying a friend homework and changing a bit so you don't get caught.

3rd year:

this was supposed the year we really dive into the ""spécialité ""

but what we got in the school was soooo underwhelming, the teachers had/have NO IDEA what data science is, the spécialité name was originally ""imagerie"" or ""image processing"" which is not really that sought or asked for in job offerings but they changed it that year to ""data science"" just to attract dump students like me who fell for it

we were taught image processing, that's it, all the buzz words were a lie, no data science, no AI, no machine learning, even tho they are written in the ""emploi de temps""

they taught us NOTHING (literally) whether it's an absent professor who has his private formationet, or teaches in private schools etc... or a prof who comes and teaches something unreleated to the subject we are supposed to learn at that session, they just teach what they know basically

and the reason we didn't complain is that we get free pass in exams, an unspoken deal, you don't study but u get free marks and don't complain plz so administration doesn't notice their absence

and because of this shitty system, I had lots of free time, I decided to improve my profile, I tried to learn from YouTube videos, but it's all the same shit whatever the subject is SO MUCH CLICKBAIT, they all teach the basics of programming languages and name it DATA SCIENCE BOOTCAMP or some shit, but no advanced courses

same with with Web Dev, it's either teaching basics or complicated projects that I follow mindlessly without learning how to start a project on my own, I can follow a video series on how to create an amazon website clone or twitter clone but when I try to create let's say a simple portfolio website I get lost.

I then resorted to buying courses, I thought paid courses would be better, I bought data science course with 300dt but it sucked, I followed it , got certificates from the website but deeply I know that I didn't learn much from it.

and now I needed to find an internship for PFE, same thing as last year, I don't get responses

and what shocked me beyond belief is that a colleague of mine who is not even spécialité  data science got offers at InstaDeep related to machine learning and stuff that I ""supposedly"" learnt

she's specialized in Embedded systems (embarqué), I genuinely can't wrap my head around it

I resorted to accepting the 1st person to contact me for 200dt per month and a shitty PFE at a startup

I really feel so lost, I don't know what to do, for the meanwhile I'm just going to complete my PFE, get my diplomas but then I don't know what I'm going to do, I really need help

I sometimes think that I made the wrong decision by choosing software engineering, I feel it's just developer with a bit of prestige, I have been so frustrated lately

I don't even what to work on , should I pursue data science ? web dev ? Microsoft technologies ?...

job offers have all sorts of programs they are asking for and I'm lost

I also feel that the whole thing about recruitment is just having a fancy profile, just look good (especially if you are a girl) and have an exaggerated linked in achievements (making the simplest tasks you did sound so profound and deep and hard) because people from outside the domain don't know if you are exaggerating",,,,,,2022-02-27 12:50:25

t2z4xf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/t2z4xf/seeking_guidance_about_studies/,6,Seeking guidance about studies,"I've reformatted this post about a thousand times before finally posting it. And I'm still unsure.  
I've always been good at being self taught. I've learned computer science to the point where I teach it to friends who study computer science at this point, And I helped people with their PFE, I've engaged in a lot of forms of activities on open source development and I do read online documentation, resources and books often.  
This isn't about computer science, I just love learning. And I spend most of my spare time doing nothing but that.  
And here is where problems begin. I study prepa, I have a concourse at the end of the year, and the way I see it. THERE IS NO WAY I AM GOING TO PASS !!!  
I hate the way they teach us, And no matter how hard I try, I just end up not being able to understand anything the teacher and the course say. When I study it my way (by watching a documentary or reading a book or just looking it up and reading online sources available in english) things work out great. But this is energy consuming and in my university, [attending classes is obligatory](http://www.issatmh.rnu.tn/useruploads/images/%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%BA%20%D9%84%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%A9%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%AD%D9%84%D8%A9%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%B6%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9.jpeg) and teachers suck. Attending the class is both a waste of time and consumes your energy. And the worst part is that your understanding of the subject doesn't matter as long as you can answer the most number of questions right (I found out that most people have no idea WTF we're studying, but they still manage to get good marks. And a lot of them do get relatively good marks. so when it comes to marks, I'm well below average). I honestly don't want any of this, And I've been thinking of quitting for a while now (as the stress is increasing and I'm feeling more and more helpless because this isn't the way I want to do things, But doing things my way isn't effective at all). I've also found out that a lot of companies in Tunisia are opting for the self taught engineers because they seem to understand that the educational system in this country sucks (I read this in a comment here on r/Tunisia). This leaves me with no reason at all to carry on studying (the only reason why I'm still doing this is because it feels risky to drop everything. And I don't think I can convince my parents that easily).  
And if you want me to be honest. I don't even want a job. I just enjoy learning and would like to spend all of my time doing it. Maybe contributing to the open source community and all. And I wish I was living in the US so that I can become a volunteer at [The Venus Project](https://www.thevenusproject.com/) (I mean after all they're aiming for a world without money where you can spend your life learning and helping the civilization evolve). but I don't live in the US :p.  
Anyways, as you can tell, being a tunisian comes with the limitation of always not knowing how tomorrow will be like. I'd like to ask about some guidance of what should I do. The stress is killing me lately.",,,,,,2022-02-27 22:05:48

I've never, in my life in the fucking 17 years that i lived on this damned earth, felt like this.
From the time she started talking about what's happening to her I've started fucking shaking furiously, i bet she cried when she was talking to me about that mf because i felt her, i never say shit like this but yep, i feel like she needs help and i wanna help her.
I couldn't sleep, im fucking overthinking this shit, im trying to find a solution by myself but i couldn't cuz this is the first time some shit like this happens to me, and guess what? I'm the only mf that knows her story (and now y'all are with me), that's what made me think of this as my responsibility because i love this girl (a bit cringe but yeah bear with me guys).
Soooo please, any help would be appreciated.

I’m currently in the process of teaching myself web development and sitting down alone in my room all day reading documentation is getting harder by the day.
Seeing a lot of posts about software development on this sub I thought I’d ask if anyone has any idea about an open internship position that a young guy without a college degree can join whether paid or unpaid, compensation is not an issue here I’m just looking for a learning position, or a mentor of some sorts that can help me improve myself.

I could really appreciate any pointers as well, thank you and have a great day !",,,,,,2022-03-01 08:31:05

My argument was; why  everytime a foreign movie that reflects a social phenomenon (even one that is considered a taboo in our society) is released, it gets praised and the director and actors get applauded by Arab movie viewers, it is discussed merely as what it is, a good movie. however, when it's an arab production it's a big NO under the claims that we as Arab shouldn't make such movies, shouldn't help spread such ""messages"" , and that such movies, ones that discuss taboos, are helping in the normalization of these taboos, while in my opinion, these latter (adultery, fornication, prostitution..) already exist in our society and we don't need to go to a theater to see them and be influenced by them. I hope i don't sound like I'm advocating for depravity and moral degradation here, just seeking opinions here. Am i wrong to think that all movies should be discussed objectively?

I tried switching branches early on in the year to Maths or Science (only 2 available options in my high school.) but apparently you can't switch from Tech to one of those two, as they're higher up in the branch pyramid or some shit idk.

I have no one to turn to basically, as my parents won't let me leave this high school to go to a normal one and study a branch I actually want to (Economy in this case, not because it's easy or anything but because I actually like it and am interested in it), and most of my friends just tell me to suck it up and do the hard work, when I'm trying my hardest but can't understand stuff for the life of me.

Additional information: I'm a young teacher with a degree and currently I'm working in a private school, as you know our country isn't recruiting teachers anymore and to be honest due to the high unemployment rates, most private schools offer humiliating salaries to say the least, i have a co-worker who has masters in chemistry and now works as social studies teacher with a low salary, the examples are unlimited so there you have it
Ps. I'm very thankful for this subreddit and I'm looking forward for your answers ❤️",,,,,,2022-03-03 23:39:58

I’m posting on behalf of a US friend who needs to know the Tunisian Arabic common terms for the following words for use in a writing project. She doesn’t want the dictionary definition, she wants the words that people actually use but she keeps finding answers for Standard Arabic. Regional variations are fine. Word list:

* penis (the equivalent usage of ‘cock’)

* what you call your mother/father/grandparents (Mom/mother/mommy for example) 

* Term of endearment/affection used to address your own child.

* Term of endearment/affection used to address a small child, generally.

* Term of endearment/affection used to address your sibling (gender irrelevant)

* ‘Exectutive’ (as in ‘the person in charge of a company’). CEO is also fine.

There is a certain ""stigma"" concerning being friendless in our society where the majority of people are sociable or at least want to socialize on a daily basis even if they somehow have poor social skills. This stigma makes it harder for someone to admit that he/she is alone. 

But the fact is, sometimes we can't control our circumstances and things tend to get worse for some people.

If you happen to be a loner dm me, let's have a chat and plan to meet someday and create a group of people going through the same unfortunate circumstances that led us all
to lose all or most of our close friends and probably become withdrawing from society as a whole. 

Let's lift each other up and create a support group and encourage each other to start fresh, or we could just make it casual and create a group on Discord or Messenger and plan to meet someday and see how things go. 


Go ahead and contact me anytime. 
Best of luck for all.

Edit: 
I'll be posting an invitation link for a Discord server later this day, for those who don't have a Discord account, go ahead and create one and join us.

Edit2:
Here's the link everyone:

Real conversations started in October 2021. After 2 months, it was the first time I expose my feelings to her. She didn't say yes and she didn't say no neither. She said that she is heartbroken due to a past experience and that she needs more time to recover. I have never fallen for a girl like her and I seriously feel like I found my dream wife. We are actually accomplishing our End-of-Studies projects and she knows well my plans for the upcoming future. For several times, I established a conversation about my/our future according to such relationship, or let's say could we even call it a ""relationship"". Most of the times she runs away from this subject, and sometimes she claims that if she doesn't like me, then she would have definitely kicked me out of her life since the begining. Each time, I decide to just let it go with the flow, and that if it's meant to be then it will be. I will not talk about my bravery with her and how I have always been there with her in every single moment. Back in the days, I had a huge relationship that has lasted for over 5 years, which means that I'm not a childish player. These days, I keep having that mind conversations with myself, telling me that it's obvious, this girl doesn't feel the same as I do and that it's one-sided love. I texted her seeking her honest explanation. She never made anything explicit. 
• Is she afraid to lose me as a close friend once she tells me No ? 
• Is she afraid of harming me by saying No ? 
She is that kind of conservative and straight, she did never even tell me I love you or just I miss you, she is not romantic actually but I still love her like nobody else does. I feel like she took too much time to know  my real intentions and behavior. Now I'm seriously thinking of distancing myself for a while. If she's interested in our relationship then she would feel something missing. 
• What do you think of her acts ? 
• Is there any girl here to explain to me what the f is going on ? 
• Any suggestions about the next move ?",,,,,,2022-03-12 17:12:42

His question still unanswered هل تونس جمهورية أم مملكة أم حديقة حيوانات أم سجن؟","[Zouhair Yahyahoui](https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/زهير_اليحياوي), alias Ettounsi, founded and edited one of the first open discussion forums on the Internet, the satirical website TUNeZINE. 

This 'Zine' (a play on words connecting the genre to the President) drew participants from across the political spectrum discussing women's issues, human rights, economic problems, freedom of expression as well as religion. 

The site itself was often victim of the prevalent censorship in Tunisia (Ammar404) access to it could be difficult if at all possible, and though he used a pseudonym, Yahyaoui himself was tracked down and arrested for creating the site. Imprisoned for eighteen months in the Borj al Amri prison, there were numerous campaigns for his release. 

During his imprisonment, he executed three hunger strikes which helped to draw the attention of the international community. 

I still remember the days where I had to host my own proxy servers to be able to do research for school. Anything and everything where people can freely post content was banned ""Error404"" from Google translate, Youtube, Skype, dailymotion, Wikipedia, Facebook to all the forums and blogs. [Tunisia was infamous for being heavily censored.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_Tunisia)

Zouhair Yahyahoui died for asking a valid question. Still unanswered to this day.

tf6nma,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/tf6nma/visiting_tunisia_for_a_week_in_may/,2,Visiting Tunisia for a week in May. Recommendations (in particular regarding staying in Sousse)?,"Hello everyone,

I'll be visiting Tunisia in May, landing in Enfidha and departing from Tunis after 8 days. I'm mostly interested in visiting the historical and architectural sites, as well as spending some afternoons and evenings relaxing by the beach or at a bar if weather permits. Since a week isn't too much time, I'll be focusing on Tunis/Carthage/Sidi Bou Said around the capital, and the area around Sousse/Monastir/El Jem/Kairouan further south. 

My current plan would be to book an accommodation for 4-5 nights somewhere in Sousse, and 2-3 nights in Tunis. Sousse appeals to me because as far as I can tell it's got nice beaches and good touristic infrastructure, while also being the main transportation hub in the area which would make it easy to do a bunch of short day trips to the other sites by train or louage (I really rather not rent a car). However, I've also read that it can be quite hectic in the touristic season, but I'm hoping things will still be relatively calm in May (would that be the case?) Alternatively, I've read that Monastir and Mahdia in particular are calmer with even better beaches, but of course with the trade-off not not being as well connected as Sousse.

So, does Sousse sound like it would best suit my needs? If so, what particular areas, beaches, or accommodations would you recommend? It doesn't have to be a standard hotel/resort, as a matter of fact I'd be interested in alternative/unique accommodations that you may be familiar with. Ideally tough I'd like to stay within walking distance to a beach and maybe some restaurants/bars.

Thanks for reading!

The time it was supposed to come, 9:40, came and went. Two hours later it finally arrived, and the wagon had no empty seats so I stood, oh well I'm not in a hurry. The train goes normally to Sousse and Sfax, but there everyone except an old man leaves and we're alone there. The train goes a bit further to the west and then it stops. The old man smokes a cigarette, then leaves, and TWO HOURS LATER the train finally starts to go again. Now it's completely dark, I am in an empty wagon without a connection to the others, my phone is at 15% battery. The train was supposed to arrive at Metlaoui at 17, but it came at ELEVEN. The doors wouldn't open so I had to jump out of the back like some crazy drunkard. The streets were empty, but luckily there was one man whom I spoke with, he led me to a place where he said a bus could come. And it actually did.

Could someone please tell me what the fuck I just experienced? Why was my wagon empty after Sfax? How are you supposed to know which station you're at in the dark? Why did he stop for two hours when it was already two hours too late of schedule?",,,,,,2022-03-27 23:25:46

Translation;

How many onions marinated in mouse shit do we have

Cry for yourselves and the ignorance you have

Because you think you are smart

But the only satisfaction you will ever have is to look in the mirror

And say

""How much of an idiot am I""

""How much of an idiot am I""

""How much of an idiot am I, Mr. Idiot""

*Actual singing starts

If you have a dirty mind

Go in front of a mirror and say how much of an idiot you are

If you think you are going to ridicule me

I will react in the most direct manner



You're not even better than the trash in Għammieq Valley

Put a weight around your neck, maybe you'll be cured

Open your ears well

For what I am about to tell you


You onion marinated in mouse shit

You onion marinated in mouse shit


The cretins we have in this country

Told me my tie doesn't match with my shirt


Either because I am against the Church or against the Government

The devil will turn me into a kebab in Hell (my favourite line 😆)


You're not even better than the trash in Għammieq Valley

Put a weight around your neck, maybe you'll be cured

Open your ears well

You carrot brain, a perfect example

Overflown with cow urine from a farm

You can of peas expired with time


You onion marinated in mouse shit

To put things in perspective, I come from an upper-middle-class family. Meaning, we have multiple properties (land, houses, other real estate), multiple cars, etc...


We grew up pretty sheltered and pretty much had anything we ever wanted.


Some background about me: I'm currently 29 yeas old, still living with my family, have a stable job in a managerial position that pays relatively well, have a paid-off car that's worth around 40K, have no debt, and around 220K sitting in a savings account that I have no idea what to do with.


Back to the main issue here. Despite the way we were raised, and even though I can afford to go out often, buy things, travel and enjoy life, I always find myself getting PRETTY CHEAP with any and all kinds of expenditures.


I always try to save as much as I possibly can and always think about the future. Specifically, mine and my partner's, if I ever get to marry someone, someday. PS: No kids for me. I never wanted them and always avoid partners who want to have them in the future.


My questions is, how the fuck do I stop being so cheap and start enjoying life?

We agreed on 1100$ which would've been a game changer since I want to save a little money to get married with my 5 years fiancee.

Unfortunately, this company started insinuating that my budget requirements was too high for them. After a couple of emails I managed to convince them that it was a fair amount since I have a 5 years experience in the IT department .

Next, they came up with the excuse that the client postponed the recruitement process and that they will contact me whenever another opportunity comes up.

I don't want to burden you with more details but to sum everything up, I've had 40 mails exchanges with this company (they take 2 to 3 days to respond) to no avail.

tuz24y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/tuz24y/for_tunisians_abroad_who_bought_property_in/,14,"For Tunisians abroad who bought property in Tunisia, how was your experience?","I'm in my late 20s and have been living abroad for nearly 8 years now. I want to buy property here but it's so expensive (at least 2m dinars for an apartment) that I'd need to pay too much on mortgage every month which would really stress me out financially and given my age it doesn't seem wise to live paycheque to paycheque trying to pay mortgage.

So I've been thinking of buying property somewhere on the coast in Tunisia that I can rent out throughout the year and use for a month or two when I visit. However, there's a few issues with that I'm trying to weigh in my decision, so please challenge my assumptions:

**Pros**

\- Mortgage would be in dinars which means that it's likely it will be cheaper in the future as I get paid in dollars

\- 300-400k dinars would get me the equivalent of a 4-5m property here

\- Any money I have in dinars is always stuck in Tunisia without any use so this gives me something I can use, especially that my family sometimes needs payments abroad but can only pay me back in dinars

**Cons**

\- I don't plan to return to Tunisia permanently anytime soon (maybe retirement) and it seems like there's no way to take rent or property sale money out of Tunisia, so it will have to be used for a mortgage or for my visits to Tunisia. I can't even convert 6k TND most Tunisians can while traveling because I was told I'm not a Tunisian resident. In other words, any money I earn is very much illiquid.

\- Tunisian taxes and complications with my taxes here

\- I want to get a mortgage and not pay in full (makes sense financially) and Tunisia has high interest rates (8% in Tunisia vs &lt;2% here)

\- Instability: what if Tunisian governments whether now or later decide to tax insane amounts or take my property. Not as much of a risk here

tw3gjv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/tw3gjv/my_experience_with_myposte_app_by_the_tunisian/,20,My Experience with myPoste app by the Tunisian Post,"Last week, I saw a Facebook ad from the **Tunisian Post** about their [new updated app myPoste](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tn.poste.myposte&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US).

I had a bad experience linking my old CCPNet account to the app back in October because of a ridiculous error in the myPoste.

I noticed the page is ***verified*** and the posts are somewhat متعوب عليهم.

I also noticed that they recently hosted a fintech hackathon in Kairouan.

&amp;#x200B;

So I decided to give it another try:

\- I updated the app (important).

\- Although I had an old CCPNet account, I decided to create a new account.

\- Everything went smooth. I particularly liked the biometric login and the 2FA.

\- The app comes with all the available features disabled by default. I like that.

\- I went through the FAQ. They are detailed enough but in French.

\- I went to accounts &gt; link existing account expecting hustle with the customers support since the CCPNet system is archaic.

\- Everything was streamlined. You are asked to provide ID, postal ID, and a selfie with your ID.

\- I made sure everything is clear, in focus and all 4 corners are visible. For the selfie I made sure to disable the ""selfie flip"" option on my mobile's camera so the selfie with ID is readable and not mirrored.

\- I accepted the TOS and confirmed the request.

\- Less than 24h later. I went and checked the app. There was a notification. Request approved.

\- I restarted the app and I can now manage my CCP. All other features are still disabled.

\- I went to services and activated the ones I need: managing my Visa cards, cheques, wire transfers.

\- The app asked for BioID, password and then told me to restart app.

\- After restarting the app, everything I asked for was enabled and I can even see 3 years old card transactions and wire transfers.

Things  that can be improved:

\- Video FAQ: most complaints I saw are from people not understanding the verification process : sending scanned copied and blurred IDs.

\- English localization.

\- A Web dashboard. If you try to visit the [my.poste.tn](https://my.poste.tn) with a computer browser your IP will be blocked and you will get Access denied error and you even won't be able to login from the app until you change you IP.

\- Detailed documentation in Arabic. Most reviews I come across are from people clicking aimlessly.

\- System notifications not just in app notifications.

\- UI/UX are decent but can be improved.

I really like the new app and I believe it to be a good start.

They offer contactless online account creation and Card request.

The Tunisian poste was always pushing toward innovation although the Central Bank don't like what they are doing and always try to stop them ""because of regulations"".

I have talked with a lot of people from all over and everyone insists that moving out is an integral part of a person's character development as is teaches a person to be self sufficient and self reliable, while giving them the opportunity to manage money and time, plus it comes with freedom which can be a double edged sword, you might get too lazy to clean/ study...

what's your opinion on the matter? Do you think that moving out is an important part of adulting?

I thought I would share it here for those that are interested in the aviation industry in Tunisia. It was a scheduled flight from Bari to Djerba that unfortunately ran out of fuel mid-flight because of improper instrumentation being installed on the airplane, therefore, the fueling operator put less fuel than required, hence both engines flamed out.

Full report on the incident: https://ansv.it/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/FINAL-REPORT-ATR-72.pdf

Cockpit Voice Recorder: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C3guOp5ygQ (it has been noted that the air traffic controllers are partially to blame due to their inability to properly communicate in English)


I was also wondering if someone here works in the aviation industry in Tunisia (mostly maintenance) and could give some insight into the state of it. So far, I am very thankful that there never was any other incident on a Tunisian civilian plane apart from this one but it would be great to have some insight from those working in this (Maybe Tunisair Technics, or any FOB).

I believe that in modern aviation history, the only civilian flight that has crashed in Tunisia is the EgyptAir 843 on Ennahli: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EgyptAir_Flight_843 (its report: https://www.icao.int/safety/airnavigation/AIG/Documents/Safety%20Recommendations%20to%20ICAO/Final%20Reports/02000860_final_report.en.pdf)

Side note: It seems that this incident's investigation sparked diplomatic tensions between Tunisia and Italy because Italy denied Tunisia access to the A/C, Flight Data Recorder (FDR) and Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR). This is a clear violation of ICAO international conventions as it is mentioned in a letter from the Tunisian embassy in the end of the incident report.",,,,,,2022-04-05 16:00:31

So, this is kind of a silly ""popularity contest"" between cities! I'm using it for ""experience points"", also.

When you have a few free minutes, list ALL the Italian cities whose name you remember in your comment.

You'll have two options to do that:

1) Take this survey on this website (anonymous and registration-free, with a couple of questions more): [https://www.opinionstage.com/ascanio-provenzale/italian-cities-s-popularity-contest-2022-edition2](https://www.opinionstage.com/ascanio-provenzale/italian-cities-s-popularity-contest-2022-edition2)

2) Write that down on a comments (see instructions below)

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*If the Italian users want to play, they can take the online survey, but they must specify their nationality. Maybe it simpler to write a comment on this post.

&amp;#x200B;

*Prizes  will be awarded to the various cities (eg. ""most mentioned"", ""most  obscure one to get mentioned"", ""nobodylovesyou"" etc.) !*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*

I ask you to include in your posts:

Your (COUNTRY)

If you want and you don't risk to be fired/dumped/murdered, next to the names of the cities, the (REASON) why you know them.

&amp;#x200B;

An example:

FLORENCE (ART)

ANZIO (HISTORY)

CATANIA (I HATE HORSES AND I EAT THEIR MEAT AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK)

Thanks to everyone who will participate in this bizarre project!

This is going to be a long post so buckle up.

This is a big issue that I'm currently dealing with. It all started after my father gave me his car. (4 years ago approx).

It's a piece of art when it comes to garbage. For those wondering it's a Renault 19, plate 69 (wink wink).

Since day one the car started being a pain. I learned alot about car defects, mechanical parts, batteries, carburator, alternator, gimbals, breaks, lights, oils...

I have been to almost every goddamn mechanic or electrician in my area. And everytime I say it's fixed and I won't be facing more issues, something else pops the fuck up and commands me to spend more on this old battleship.

I can keep complaining for hours on how the french people fucked up in a billion ways making this trash.

It's resilient, spacious, low cost for mechanical parts relatively speaking. But these few positive points don't mean anything when the car isn't working most of the time.

I have been upset and dissapointed for a long time since basically everytime I ride it I don't feel comfortable knowing that the car can stop at literally anytime and I have to be towed back home.

So, I have been wondering. How people get a new car??

I know people get bank loans which i truly detest. I have an average income and I'm planning to get married next year so a loan isn't an option.

If I have to sell it, it's not worth a lot. Probably 7 or 8 mil tops. And even used cars nowadays cost a fucktone of money. And there is always risks with used cars. (can't afford the same nightmare twice)

I was thinking of finding someone in the family to lend me money (after I sell the car) but mom advised me not to. We have rich family members but mom's ego comes in between me asking for some money from them. (which I will return monthly)

I discussed the issue with some friends, but none of them cared enough. 

They didn't go through the torture of having to push your car and asking strangers on the road for help to get it to a mechanic, They didn't spend a fortune on car parts and repairs, they don't spend a lot of gas money because they have economic new cars (unlike my hungry dumb beast)..

I'm really mentally and physically tired, psychologically destroyed, and helpless since I have to drive to work.

Any ideas, advice, sharing your problem will be appreciated.

As the title states, I'm a photographer travelling to Tunisia later this year. Now, I have some experience with the country and I've never had any trouble with my gear over there, but this time around I'll be packing a bit more than usual. I love the country and never encountered any issues during any of my previous 7 stays over there, but this one seems to be rather specific in today's age and state of the world.

The main thing I'm curious about is drones. I've recently gotten into videography as well and acquired a DJI Mini 2 and having a blast with it. I don't seem to find any specific information regarding drones in Tunisia online, but I'm aware of the state the country is in these past few years and I was wondering if anyone has some sort of experience carrying drones into the country. Both positive and negative alike would be useful to hear.

I've heard of some horror stories regarding drones in Egypt and the nightmares people went through in customs, but I'm not quite sure if those are applicable to Tunisia.

For reference, I'll be landing with a late-night flight into Tunisia most likely and then making my way to Sousse-Monastir-Djerba.

maybe make a rule for the people that already brought $/€ that u can only spend 1/4 of your earnings online  


If you go look at the black market on Facebook/Discord/Telegram you will find a lot of money being traded there and it's not regulated and the country doesn't benefit from it at all

I’m currently an intern in a big corporation - extremely long work hours (I go home at 1-2am most nights of the week), and an overall disregard for personal health/problems of interns/employees. When I got the internship I was really happy about it and expected it to be quite hard but not to this degree. The workload does not bother me since the internship ends in June and I am learning a lot. However, a member of my family is undergoing last stages of cancer in Tunis and I would like to be able to come home for 10-14 days in May. Since they would never allow that, I was thinking of getting a doctor’s certificate attesting that I have health problems hence I can’t work for that time period. I was only able to find a « généraliste » (family doctor) to give me the attestation but a friend of mine who works in a similar corporation said that the attestation looks highly suspicious coming from a generalist doctor attesting that I need 10-14 days to rest bc of « health issues », he said that they won’t take it seriously and that it basically will end up hurting me. I am now looking for a specialist doctor in Tunisia to give me such attestation. I know it’s unethical but I’m genuinely left with no choice. Do you know anyone that could help me please ?

 الحرب على داء في تونس ما تتربح كان بالحرب على سبب الداء. حارب الفقر, هذا لازم يكون الهدف الأول والوحيد. وقف ما تبنيش قناطر و ما تصلحش كيسات خاطر كان شعبك جاهل راهم بش يقعدوا الكيسات ديما مكسرين. وقف أي مشروع مش يساهم في محاربة لفقر و حارب لفقر بكل ما عندك من سلطة و صلاحيات.

 خلي شعبك ياكل و يشبع ماغير ما يخمم في المصروف متى غدوة. خليه يعدي نهارو مرتاح خاطر يعرف إلي مهما باش يصير, باش يروح و يلقى ماكلة في دارو. خليه يعيش مطمان. 

 و باعد  حارب الجهل بالمؤسسات التربوية و دور الشباب و المنح ، أتى وحدك وحدك تبدى ترى في تونس تتحسن. قاعدة تقتل وحدة وحدة في الداء كيما الدوا يقتل فالفيروس وسط لبدن. 

   تونس بلاد باهية و تستاهل كل لخير أما مشكلتنا الخايب راضعينو مع لحليب. علمونا لازمك تخدم مخك باش توصل على خاطر لعباد خدمة مخاخها كي ما لقات شنو تاكل.

The ""EGS Gafsa Community"" server aims to gather all Tunisians, North Africans and anyone interested in Football (whether African/CAF or Worldwide Football) and create a footballing-loving community where we tackle important topics related to the beautiful game on the Tunisian/African stage.

We will be talking a lot about football in the continent here, but we also talk about other topics, such as music, and gaming, it would be great to have as many of you guys there!

uau3aa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/uau3aa/الإسلام_في_تونس/,31,الإسلام في تونس,"السلام عليكم 
اني نحب نحكي على الإسلام في تونس ، و في العصر الحالي .. يطريقة ساهلة و بالدارجة .. و الكلام هذا موجه للتونسيين المسلمين، اللي عندهم شك في الاسلام، اللي عندهم مشاكل مع الاسلام، للي يحب يفهم .. طبعا كل انسان مرحب به هنا 

بش نكونوا واضحين، اني لهنا مانحكيش على الثوابت و الاسس متع الدين الاسلامي الحنيف، فما حاجات و حدود مالازمهاش تتمس، و فما حاجات ثانوية مرنة تتغير و تتبدل حسب المكان و الزمان ..

• باهي، اكيد الكلنا لاحظنا اللي فما فجوة كبيرة (قاعدة تكبر) بين احكام الشريعة الاسلامية/الفتاوى و بين مقتضيات العصر الحالي، شمعناها؟ معناها قاعدين نطبقوا في فتاوى قديمة ماهيش متماشية مع فاش قاعدين نعيشوا فيه توا سواء من مشاكل، ظواهر و حاجات جديدة قاعدة تظهر كل نهار مختلفة على شكان موجود قبل(التكنولوجيا مثلا)، حاجات اخرى تبدلت و الا ولات مختلفة جملة وحدة على شكان موجود في العصور الماضية ..
مانجيش نقول الفتوى هذي من عهد الدولة الاموية/العثمانية/الحفصية و نجي نفرضها و نطبقها على التوانسة بالسيف ..

•من جهة اخرى، كل بلاد و ارطالها، كل بلاد و عرفها (ما يحللش الحرام)، و كل بلاد و مميزاتها، ثقافتها، عاداتها، دبشها، ماكلتها، تاريخها .. كل بلاد حالة خاصة فريدة من نوعها، خليط من برشا حاجات بالضرورة بش يكون ما يشبهش لحتى بلاد اخرى .. معناها مانجيش اني و نقول فما فتوى مصرية/سعودية/مغربية/عمانية/.. نطبقاها بالسيف و نفرضها على تونس ..

&gt;&gt; فما حاجة اسمها فقه الواقع، شمعناها فقه الواقع؟ هو فقه يراعي احوال الناس، فقه مبني على دراسة الواقع، (sociologie/anthropologie) كيفما علم الانسان و علم الاجتماع، دراسة تكون شاملة و دقيقة لكل بلاد وحدها من جميع جوانبها، بش يكون الحكم الفقهي/الفتوى متماشية مع البلاد و مع اهل البلاد و طباعهم ..

// مثلا : في دولة كي السعودية قبل كي كانوا النسا الكل يلبسوا اكحل و غوامق، حرام المرا تخرج لابسة روز، اصفر، احمر خاطرها بش تجبد الانتباه لاها ( من شروط الحجاب انك ما تكونش ظاهرة في وسط النسا ، كيما في تونس ""حرام"" المرا تلبس اكا الجلبابات الفراشة خاطرها حاجة غريبة في المجتمع التونسي)
في المقابل، في دولة كيما موريطانيا وين النسا يلبسوا دبش multicolouleur حرام مرا تلبس دبش لونو اكحل و الا دبش مغاير للي اللباس المنتشر عندهم .

• و اخيرا كل دولة و مذهبها، ماتجيش تفرض فقه حنفي/شافعي/حنبلي على التوانسة اللي فقههم مالكي .. و هو في الاصل اللي كان العلماء يتسماوا عندهم مذهب .. احنا الناس العاديين موش لازم ننتميوا لمذهب، احنا نختاروا عالم دين ناثقوا فيه و نتبعوه، صحيح غالط هو بش يتحاسب في اللخر موش احنا ..


• حاليا، في القرن العشرين، الواحد و العشرين، فما شيخ واحد يتسمى اسس فقه الواقع هو حبينا و الا كرهنا الشيخ القرضاوي.. نعرف اللي برشا يكرهوه اما خليكم بعاد على تاثير البروباجاندا و الاعلام .. جربتوش سمعتولوا محاضرة و الا قريتوا فتاويه ؟ 
اكثر من هكا الشيخ القرضاوي موش كان العلمانيين يكرهوه، السلفيين و الاخوان،  الكل يكرهوه خاطرو ضد افكارهم .. هوما ناس نتعصبين متشددين يحبوا يصعبوا على رواحهم الدين .. 
تعرفوا اللي القرضاوي افتى بان الغناء و الموسيقى حلال اذا كانت ما فيهاش كلام محرم و الا كليبات خليعة ؟!

• باهي، القرضاوي هذاكا شيخ جدد في الخطاب الديني في العالم الكل .. بالنسبة لتونس، حاليا و في الماضي زادا لاسباب معروفة : احتلال الدول ""الاسلامية"" لتونس و فرضها لاحكامها علينا، الاحتلال الاسباني، الفرنسي، و ما نتج عنه من ضياع للمؤسسات الاسلامية في تونس،  الاعلام، تغييب و غياب الشيوخ و تجاهلهم و تكبرهم على الشعب ..

القرضاوي انسان يخطئ و يصيب، و كان بش نقعدوا اي واحد غلط ماعادش نتبعوه هكاك نوليوا في غابة .. اني جبدت القرضاوي كمثال في التجديد في الخطاب الديني و فقه الواقع كهو ما يهمنيش في افعالو بش يتحاسب عليهم وحدو .. 
 
&gt; قعدنا ماعندناش فقه واقع خاص بينا، مافماش شيوخ تجرئت و كتبت احكام فقهية جديدة (جديدة معناها مبنية على الاسس الاسلامية و على الاحكام القديمة) و الا بالاحرى خرّجت/استنبطت احكام جديدة تتماشى مع تونس ..

&gt; قعدنا احنا كتوانسة بالسيف منتمين للحضارة العربية ماعندناش هوية، رغم ان المسلمين في دول كالصين، اليابان، موريطانيا، اندونيسيا قعدوا محافظين على ثقافتهم، لغتهم، ثيابهم، تقاليدهم و طوعوها بش تناسب الاسلام اما ما فسخوش و خذاوا عادات الجمل و الخيمة و الجبة ..


نرجع للماضي و نقول اللي الفاتحين الاوائل اللي جاوا لتونس/افريقية بش يفتحوها ما نجموش مالمرة اللولة، هوما يفتحوهة من جهة و الامازيغ يرجعوا ينكروا حتى لين بعد سبعة محاولات قبلوا انهم يسلموا على شرط انهم ما يتخلاوش على ثقافتهم و يقعدوا محافظين علاها .. 
اكا علاش التوانسة وقتها مالوا و اعتنقوا المذهب الاباضي مذهب متماشي مع صخة راسهم و قريب لافكارهم ..
 المشكلة في الدول اللي جات مبعد،

  وقتاش تم تعريب تونس؟
الدولة الفاطمية في مصر حبت تسيطر على تونس بعثت قبائل اعراب بدو متمردين لتونس بش يسطروا علاها .. جاوا قبائل الهلاليين هذوما بجمولتهم و خيامهم و دمروا تونس و حكماها .. وقتها تم تعريب تونس ..( الكلام هذا ماجبتوش من مخي، اني قريت انثروبولوجيا)
هكا قعد يصير مبعد، كل دولة تجي ما تخرج كان ما رسخت في التوانسة جزء من ثقافتها، لغتها، ماكلتها لين وصلنا ""توانسة""

اعرفوا تاريخ بلادكم و دينكم بالباهي وحدكم و لوجوا بش ما تقعدوش دمى عبيد في يدين ناس اخرى  تحقق بيكم في مطالبها وقتلي تحتاجكم و بعد ترميكم ..]


!!!    مالناس اللي اسسوا فقه الواقع في تونس نذكر عبد العزيز الثعالبي اللي تنفى و تنفات معاه افكاروا التجديدية ..
 و عنا برشا علماء ،، اكثر ماللي تتصور في مخك، نساء و رجال، في الدين، في الرياضيات، في التاريخ، في اللغات، في السياسة .. 

احنا توا حاشتنا بناس تتلهى بتجديد الخطاب الديني في تونس بش تتحرر تونس المسلمة مالجهل، مالعبودية للسعودية و للدول الاسلامية الاخرى، من فرانسا، امريكا و اي بلاد تشوف في التوانسة فارغين لا ثقافة لا دين لا هوية، مالانحراف و قلة التربية اللي انتشرت و ماهيش غلطة حتى حد .. غلطة الناس اللي حاربت الدين و خباتو و شوهت صورتو في نفوس الناس .. 

احنا توانسة. اصلنا امازيغ، و احنا حبينا و الا كرهنا، عرب، اسبانيين، افارقة، فرنسيين، نوميديين، ترك، عثمانيين، مصريين، امازيغ ..

So here goes. This also can work for locals who just want to go on holidays within Tunisia. Feel free to add things, I'll be updating.

&amp;#x200B;

# How to go to Tunisia? And how to move within the country?

* If you're abroad, the most obvious solution is to come by **plane:**

The 3 main airports that welcome regular and charter flights are: [Tunis-Carthage airport](http://www.aeroport-de-tunis-carthage.com/tunisie-aeroport-de-tunis-carthage-vols-depart.php), The [Habib Bourguiba airport of Monastir](http://www.aeroport-de-monastir-habib-bourguiba.com/tunisie-aeroport-de-monastir-habib-bourguiba-vols-depart.php) and the [Djerba-Zarzis airport](http://www.aeroport-de-djerba-zarzis.com/tunisie-aeroport-de-djerba-zarzis-vols-depart.php).

You may choose your flight from either the company you're used to (AirFrance, Emirates, Turkish Airlines, Royal Air Maroc...) or from Tunisian companies (Tunisair and Nouvelair on an international level, Tunisair Express for shorter distances, including domestic flights).

&amp;#x200B;

* Some people in the mediterranean (south of France, Italy etc.) also take the **car-ferry**, which can be a good solution if you want to go on a road trip across the country with your car.  If you do so, you'll arrive at the Goulette Harbour.
* If you're in Algeria, you can also come by bus.

**HOW TO MOVE WITHIN THE COUNTRY:**

**Within towns:** taxis, or a rented car.

* **Taxi etiquette:** the taxis are yellow. Contrarily to other countries, when their light is red, it means they're available, when they're green, it means they're already carrying other passengers. If you get in a taxi as a group, it's always preferable that one person sits in the passenger seat (at the front), firstly to keep an eye on the taximeter, but also because they like to chit chat and they sometimes take offense when everyone is sitting at the back.

**Between towns:** by bus, shared taxis (called ""louage"") or if you go through a travel agency, they can definitely put aside some private cars with a chauffeur for you.

The shared taxis thing have specific station all around the country, in Tunis the stations are in ""Moncef Bey place"", ""Baab Saadoun station"" and ""Baab Alioua station"".

# Do I have to be vaccinated? What about vaccine cards? Where can I do PCR tests when I leave?

Since the [26th of February 2022](https://www.destinationtunisie.info/conditions-voyage-tunisie-change-26-fevrier/) here are the rules of entry:

* If you're +18 and vaccinated (1 dose of Janssen/Astrazeneca OR 2 doses of Pfizer/Moderna): proof of vaccination suffices.
* If you're +18 and not vaccinated: a PCR test of -48hrs or an antigenic test (rapid test) of -24hrs are needed. You will be asked to self-isolate at home for a period of 5 days (no one really checks anymore if you really abide by).
* If you're still under the age of 18, there are no obligations whatsover.

IF and ONLY IF all the restrictions were to be back, here is what was applied before:  proof of vaccination+ PCR test + an online form to fill+ self-isolation at home (and they used to check randomly) or in hotels for non-vaccinated people.

Even if all restrictions stay lifted, please stay careful and respectful of others who wear masks/demand distancing, as the country is barely pulling itself back from the covid crisis.

**WHERE TO GET A PCR TEST WHEN LEAVING:**

* Labs. They usually do a series of tests **BEFORE** 9 am for those who want their result on the same day (if you're leaving at night or the following morning). Most of them are closed on sundays so plan accordingly.
* A PCR test costs 170 dinars (around 50€/ 50USDT). If your country accept rapid tests instead, go for it, it's less expensive.

# Great I'm in Tunisia...what to visit now?

**I'M INTO HISTORY:**

* A circuit that goes through [Dougga](https://whc.unesco.org/fr/list/794/), the city of Thibar, then Testour (they have seriously good cheese) sounds like a good day.
* So does a whole day at the one and only Carthage: the ruins, the acropolium, the thermal baths... however the museum Bardo, home to one of the biggest collections of mosaics in the world is closed to my knowledge.
* The medina of Tunis + Zitouna mosque + St Vincent de Paul cathedral.
* The Ghriba synaguoge in Djerba + ibadite mosques + the old town (the Maltese church is currently in renovation) + all the museums of Djerba.
* El Jem Amphitheatre
* City of Kairouan as a whole

**I'M HERE FOR THE BEACH**

* Bizerte, the whole coast of Ras Engela, also called ""cap angela"": it's known for being the most northenmost point in the whole continent of Africa, but the beaches are great, the water is refreshing if you're here in the midth of summer and the view is diverse (forest/dunes/hills and moutains...). If you can hop in a pickup truck, it's even better for some adventure. The Corniche side of bizerte (town) is not really swimmable anymore.
* Cap zebib: more of a ""local"" hangout, it's a bit difficult to find, but if you ever embark with friends in a good car and they know they place, you'll enjoy yourself.
* El haouaria
* Kelibia
* Korba
* Hammamet (some parts on the side of Mrezga)
* Some more in Monastir
* And obviously, in Djerba

==&gt; In most of these, you can either be in a hotel (so with lounge chairs, pre-set parasols, waiters, music...) or on a public beach (bring-your-own-chair or rent-a-chair depending on the beach). The dress code tends to be more ""free"" in hotels, but overrall there is nothing to worry about, everyone is usually minding their business.

**I'M HERE FOR THE NATURE:**

* El Kef + Tejerouine. You can visit the Jugurtha Tableland mountain, there is a pretty sick view and last time I went they were getting ready for a hot-air balloon show launch. They also have an amazing version of couscous called Borzguen.
* Bizerte (Ichkeul park for example).
* Tozeur and Tataouine, but not after april/may (it gets too hot). You can sleep in troglodyte ancestral housing, visit the desert (and camp there), oases, eat date-based food...
* Islands such as the Kuriat Isles, La Galite, Zembra &amp; Zembretta welcome organised camping trips. Daily trips for the Kuriat isles if you want to see turtles nests and go snorkeling.

My personal advice is to always contact a guide and/or a travel agency, they will be more than happy to offer private tours, and adjust according to your needs. If you say ""hey I want to see some touristy places to cover the basics but then take me to some niche places"" it's not a problem, it can definitely be done!

# Anything I should know of to help me pack my bags?

* Sunscreen. SPF 50.
* You may want to bring a pair of pants (even light, like made of linen or something) + a head scarf **NOT FOR EVERY DAY USE** but for some places that are worth visiting like historical mosques and synaguogues where both men and women cannot enter in mere shorts. The pants can also be helpful for places like administrations and police stations where wearing shorts and flip flops is frowned upon.
* Don't bring a drone if you don't want it to be seized by customs at the airport. They're not allowed in Tunisia unless you have a specific permit from dfferent ministries.

# How to avoid being scammed/pickpockets...?

* For some places, it's obvious. Souvenir shops near hotels that sell Gucci/Ralph Lauren/Prada clothes for 10€ are obviously selling fake items. They will be seized by your local customs once you go back from holidays, so avoid buying such stuff. They're only useful in ""oh no I forgot to pack a swimsuit for the kid"" type of situations.
* In medinas and other places where you may interact with merchants (sidi bou said, old towns in big cities..), bargaining is good. They like debating, it's a sport for them. But there is a limit: always keep in mind that they're artisans and that it's the way they make their living. Trying to prey on the fact that they're desperate to sell to get the prices insanely low (as I have observed some occurences) is not a good practice.
* Shows such as bellydancers, ""pirate ships"" etc. are ways of scamming tourists. They are not inherently linked to Tunisia's culture and just play on the orientalist trope. Save some money, go to local theatres, or see what's going on in the streets of Tunis (La Marsa, Lac...), Hammamet.... If you meet locals, they can get you in on some shows happening at different places that could be more sophisticated or at least in touch with the culture. Heck, why not go to a wedding, you'll have fun!
* In crowded spaces, if you're wearing a camera or a loose bag on your shoulder, wear them sideways (sling them). You have more control over them.

# Is Tunisia kid friendly?

It's definitely a country you can visit with kids. However, it wouldn't be considered kid-friendly by standards such as ""can I let my kids go visit a foreign town on their own while I do something else"", especially if they're pre-teens/juvenile. Some kid parks exist here and there, but hotels are your safest option if you just want to rest, go to a SPA-thalasso while your kids roam around.

# Is Tunisia vegetarian-vegan friendly?

Not really. The culinary traditions are quite heavy on the use of fish/meat but you can ask to get rid of them in your plate, which would leave you usually with vegetables, stew, and/or grains (couscous, bulgur...) As for the use of milk/eggs, we don't use them as much unless specified. But if you really need plant based milks and items caterers or delicatessens in Tunis mainly exist (Jardins de Carthage, Green Foods, Ben Yaghlane...).

# Is Tunisia LGBT+ friendly?

Officially, no. The law prohibits sexual acts between people of the same sex. However, simply ""being"" gay isn't prohibited, and an LGBT+ community exists especially within the night and art scenes. Bars and nightclubs such as Club Gingembre became famous for being lgbt friendly and basically gay bars.

# Tunisia introduction card: 

* The currency is the Tunisian Dinar: exchange rates on the 25/04/2022: 1€ = 3,2 Dinars. / 1 USDT = 3 Dinars. / 1£ = 3,8 Dinars. 
* Almost 12M habitants 
* The official language is Modern Standard Arabic (used in administrations and schools) but on the daily basis, the population speaks a specific dialect. French and English can be used too, French mostly by older generations and English by the younger generations. 
* Our last [Constitution dates back to 2014.](https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Tunisia_2014.pdf)

Next time after bringing the diploma they sent me out again become the certificate doesn't contain any reference number (عدد رتبي) and the deal is that my coworkers renewed their documents with the same template so what's special in me?

Any thoughts and this and if that's really a thing the reference number.

ubia2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/ubia2t/اللغة_العربية_بتونس_في_خطر/,0,اللغة العربية بتونس في خطر...!؟,"ا - مأساويّة اللّغة العربيّة في تونس اليوم :

 طبعاً، لا يَخفَى على أحد، أنّ لغتنا العربيّة المجيدة - لغـتَــنا الوطنِـيّـة والقومـيّة، تعيش اليوم حالة مأساويّة مؤلمة في تونس! فقد أصبحت هذه اللّغة التّعسة منبوذة، غريبة في عقر دارها، إفريقيّةِ عُقبة بن نافع، بلاد الجامعة الزّيتونيّة، بلاد ابن خلدون، بلاد العلاّمة الطّاهر بن عاشور، الطاهر الحداد وأبي القاسم الشّابّي، وغيرِهم كُثُر...
حسبنا أن نُـلقيَ نظرة على لغة التخاطب اليوميّة فيما بين المواطنين التونسيّين - مثقّفين كانوا أم غير مثقّفين- نجدها لغة هجينة، لا شرقيّة ولا غربيّة؛ لا رأس لها ولا عقب؛ خليط عجيب، غريب، من عربيّة دارجة وفرنسيّة محطّمة، ممسوخة، علاوةً على ما يتخلّلها من عبارات سوقيّة مبتذلة، مؤذية للأسماع، وكلماتٍ لا أخلاقيّة، من سبٍّ لاسم الجلالة، وشتمٍ  للوالدين، إلخ !...
أهذه لغة شعب متحضّر، يطمح إلى التّطوّر والتّقدّم، ويعيش في القرن الواحد والعشرين !؟… أيّ شعب في العالم، عدا شعوبنا في المغرب العربيّ، وخاصّة في تونس التي أصبحت ""رائدة"" في هذا المجال، أيّ شعب يتعامل يوميّاً بمثل هذه اللّغة ""الّلقيطة"" ؟ !
لو استمرّت الحال على هذا المنوال، ستموت في بلادنا لغتنا الوطنيّة الدّارجة ومن ثَـمَّ الفصحى، بعد بضعة عقود من الزّمن. ستضمحلّ، وتندثر، رويداً رويداً؛ إذ ستغزوها الفرنسيّةُ، لغةُ مستعمرِنا الذي اكتسح وطننا بالأمس، واليوم يكتسح عقولنا. والأمثلة على ذلك لا تُحصى.
فهناك الكثير من الألفاظ أُلقيَـت في سلّة المهملات، لِـتُـعـوِّضَها ألفاظُ وعباراتُ فرنسيّةُ، كالألوان، والتواريخ، والأشهر، والأعوام؛ وغيرها من المفردات. فمثلاً قلّما نسمع اليوم أبناؤنا ينادون أبوَيْهِم : ""papa, mama"". ثمّ هناك الكثير من الألفاظ العربيّة أو العامّيّة أُهمِلت، بل نُسيتْ تماماً، كالملّيم - عملتنا الوطنيّة- الذي عُوِّض بـــ""الفرنك""، بينما نسيَ الفرنسيّون الفرنك منذ عقدين بعد مجيء الأورو؛ و بالطبيعة الّتي استُبدِلتْ بــ""bien sûr""، وعادي ""normal""، وإمّالا أو إذن ""donc""، وامّالا لا؟ ""pourquoi pas""، وبالضّبط  ""exactement""، وبطاطا مقليّة ""frites"" وخبزة ""baguette""، ورقم أوعدد ""نُومرُو""، وعلم ""درابو""، و أصلاً "" déja""، وعلى طول ""direct أو directement""، وبصراحة "" franchement ""، و بُـقعة "" بلاصه""، والقائمة تطول ولا تنتهي ! ! ! ....
أبِـمِثْـل هذه اللّغة يتكلّم الفرنسيّ، أو الإيطاليّ، أو الصّينيّ، أو الرّوسيّ أوالألمانيّ أو حتى ""الاسرائيلي"" الذي اعاد احياء اللّغة العبرية القديمة التي ماتت في القرن الخامس قبل الميلاد؟.... وغيرهم من الشعوب الأخرى التي تعتزّ بلغتها، وتفتخر بها، وتحافظ عليها، وتثريها. ولا غرابة في  ذلك، إذ اللّغة جزء لاتتجزّأ من هُـويّتها الوطنيّة. واسمحوا لي بأنْ أستغيث في هذا المجال، بامير الشعراء أحمد شوقي حينما  قال :

                 "" إنّما الأمم الأخلاق ما بقِـيَـتْ     فإن هُـمُ ذهبت أخلاقهم ذهبوا"" 

لكن، لِـيسمحْ لي ببعض التصرّف - طبعاً بدون الإتنقاص من قيمته أوالتّطاوُل عليه - فأقول :

       "" إنّما الأمم الأخلاق [واللُّغاتُ] ما بقِـيَـتْ     فإن هُـمُ ذهبت أخلاقهم [ولُغاتُهم]  ذهبوا""

اا - مَـنِ المسؤولُ ؟

1- في نظري، المسؤول الأوّل عن هذا التردّي اللّغوي هم آباء وأمّهات صغارنا، إذ المدرسة الأولى هي الأسرة والبيت. فلو تمسّك الأولياء بلغتهم العاّمية والفصحى، واعتزّوا بهما، ولا يخاطبون أبناءهم إلاّ بهما، بدل لغة فرنسيّة ممسوخة، لَـنَـشأَ هؤلاء على حبّ لغتهم والإعتزاز والتَّـشبُّـث بها.

2- المدرسة ورجال التعليم من معلّمين، وأساتذة؛ ففي وقتنا الحاضر، هؤلاء المربّون - لسوء الحظّ، ومع احترامي لهم- يُلقوُن أغلب دروسهم بخليط من العامّـية الممزوجة بعبارات فرنسيّة أو ""مُتفرنَسة""، بدل تلقين تلامذتهم وطلاّبهم - منذ نعومة أظفارهم- لغة عربيّة سليمة، نقيّة، مرتفعة عن الألفاظ السّوقيّة المبتذلة...
هكذا نشأت الأجيال الأخيرة على العزوف عن العربيّة الفصحى خاصّة، مفضِّلين عنها الفرنسيّة و الانجليزية. لكن الذي يحزّ فى النفس أكثر أنّهم، في أغلب الأحيان، أصبحوا لا يُتقنون لا العربيّة ولا الفرنسيّة على حدّ سواء.

3- رجال الإعلام، ووسائل الإتّصالات المكتوبة، والمسموعة، والمرئيّة؛ فتلك هي الطّامّة الكبرى !.... فالمفروض أنّ مهمّتها الأساسيّة هي توعية الجماهير، والإرتفاع بمستواها التّربويّ، والثّقافي، والأخلاقي. فمثلاً، جريدة ""الصّبـاح""، تلك الصّحيفة العريقة الغرّاء، ذات التاريخ الوطنيّ المجيد، نراها اليوم لاتتردّد في استعمال مصطلحاتٍ وعباراتٍ سوقـيّة في منتهى السخافة، يتململ لها في قبره، مؤسّسها المرحوم الشيخ الحبيب شيخ روحه، كــ""الزّلطة"" و""البراكاج ""، و""الهمهاما""، و""لسيزيام""، و"" التِّـرْمِـنَـال"" ""والتّـيـارسِي""، وما إلى ذلك...
وليست إذاعاتُـنا وتلفزاتُـنا - على كثرتها، خاصّة بعد الثورة - بأحسن منها. فقد أصبح أغلبها مراكزَ هدمٍ وتخريب للّلغة العربيّة، لا تنـميـتَها وإثراءَها والحفاظَ عليها.
أمّا الإشهارفحدِّث ولا حرج ! فـشوارعنا، وأنهجنا، امتلأت كلّها بالملصقات والإعلانات ذات لغة صمّاء، لا تُفهم أحياناً. فـنجد ألفاظا بالعامّية، مكتوبة بأشكال لا رابطَ بينها، متباينة، مختلطة بعبارات فرنسيّة، مليئة بأفدح الأخطاء.
ومؤسّساتنا وإداراتنا العموميّة، ومحلاّتنا التجاريّة، ومقاهينا، ومطاعمنا، كلّها أو جلّها تفنّنت في تزويق واجهاتها ومسمّياتها بالفرنسيّة فحسب؛ أمّا العربيّة فقد كادت تغيب تماماً عن الأنظار، حتّى أصبح المتجوّل في مُدنِـنا يشعر وكأنّه في فرنسا لا في بلاد عربيّة، لولا الفضلات والأوساخ الملقاة على أرصفتنا ….. !!!

ااا - ما العمل ؟

أنا لست خبيراً، ولا سياسيّا، لأقدّم حلولاً ناجعة لمعالجة هذه الظّاهرة اللّغويّة المأساويّة. لكن غيرتي على لغتنا الرّائعة ذات التاريخ المجيد، وحضارتنا الأنسانيّة التي أشعَّت على العالم بأسره، شرقاً وغرباً، طيلة أكثر من ستّة قرون. لقد آلمني أشدّ الألم، أن أراها اليوم تحتضر في بلادنا. فأردتُ فقط تحسيس شعبنا بمختلف شرائحه نحو الخطر المحدق بلغتنا هذه وهي عماد هويّتنا الوطنيّة والقوميّة؛ فإن فقدناها فقدنا هويّتنا.
في رأيي المتواضع، لقد حان الأوان لِـتدارُك الأوضاع، والإسراع بكلّ حزم وجدّ، لوضع حدّ لهذه الفوضى اللّغويّة، وذلك بإصدار قوانين رسميّة، صارمة وجدّية تفرض تعريب كلّ وسائل الإتّصالات المكتوبة والمسموعة والمرئيّة، العامّة والخاصّة؛ وإجبارالمؤسّسات والمحلاّت العمومية والتجاريّة على كتابة الملصقات واللاّفتات والواجهات بالعربيّة، مرفقةً بالفرنسيّة، إن اقتضت الضّرورة ذلك، خاصّة في الأماكن السياحيّة؛ وحبذا لو تكون بالأنجليزيّة إذ هي اليوم الأكثر انتشاراً؛ مع العلم بأنّ أغلبّ السّـوّاح يتقنون هذه اللّغة أكثر من الفرنسيّة، علاوةً على أنّ الزائرين الفرنسيّين هم أقلّية بالنسبة لغيرهم.
إلى ذلك، ينبغي وضع مخطّط جدّي وجذريّ لتعريب التّعليم الأساسي والثانوي والعالي، مع تطوير تعليم اللّغات الحيّة، الأنجليزيّة بشكل خاصّ، لانّها اليوم هي لغة العلوم والتقنيات الحديثة، وغيرها من اللّغات العالميّة الأخرى كالفرنسيّة، والألمانيّة، والصّينيّة، واليابانيّة، إلخ....",,,,,,2022-04-25 10:49:13

Me and my girlfriend are from Bosnia and are looking to visit your country in August and stay for a month - month and a half. We are looking for some tips and experiences from people living there.

We have some basic questions that will determine if we will really visit the place.

First of all, because we come from a poor country, we don't have much money to spend so we would like to know how much would a day of living cost for two people. Not looking for fancy hotels, of course. Couch surfing or hostels are perfectly fine.

Second - if we run short on budget, we have some skills we can use to try and earn some side money. We both know excellent English. My girlfriend does yoga. I can teach programming skills or guitar. I could also play the flute on the street. How welcoming are your people to that kind of thing and how much could we earn per hour?

Third - are your people welcoming towards strangers? We would like to learn and experience your culture as much as possible!

Fourth - how is the weather in August/September?

Fifth - does your country require vaccination proof for entry or is a negative PCR test enough? Do we need to enter quarantine if we aren't vaccinated?

And finally, all in all - what do you recommend the most about your country??

We're looking forward to your answers! All the best!",,,,,,2022-04-25 13:32:07

Currently I am a high schooler in Carthage and hopefully if I succeed in Bac I'm planning on studying in Grand Tunis, I will not get out of here anytime soon, So I need something to use for transport and public transport is trash so I want something reliable I can own, It doesn't have to be fast, Just something I can ride on. I got a bicycle but riding it on a hill like Carthage is a pain in the butt, like I can't go from Kram to Presidence without stopping to take a rest so I need something motorized and the cheapest thing I can get is that scooter above, best thing about it is that I can pay for it bit by bit, so It's the only thing affordable for me.

But my main concern with it is that whether I can fit it in a backpack or not because obviously I can't leave it outside, Would it sound weird to go to the classroom with a large bag on my back ? I don't want any attention, Funnily enough I'm already getting attention for owning a bicycle and hearing comments about it from my teachers and classmates, I'm the ""bicycle kid"", and I don't understand why, so having a scooter on my back isn't going to go smooth and quiet.

Also, do people on the street give reaction to the people riding e-scooters ? Do they make fun of them or anything like that ?

And finally, is it going to be a good idea to have it ? Like would it make life ? Did it make it easier for you ?

**Tl;dr : Where do you put your e-scooter ? Can you fit it in a bag / backpack ? Do you go to the classroom / workplace with it ? Do people harass you for it ?**",,,,,,2022-04-27 03:41:46

Especially not when we don't even have the facilities and they're thrown upon each other in cells with conditions below² average.

Instead, why not make them do community services like cleaning the streets or serving the government with probably another internal affairs branch that takes care of them and keeps track of their progress so that they will fulfill their punishment and be ultimately free again?

This will create more jobs for government (seeing we will need law enforcement officers that will guard them as they perform their tasks for a specified period that will be determined by the law). And it will make our country more livable (be it in terms of seeing how streets are cleaned, or how lenient it has become towards drug users). We know most inmates are drug users and it is unnecessary to destroy their future and their families over something only God can judge them about; over something that doesn't kill anyone nor cause any public disorder except polluting the air which is already being polluted by cigarettes, cars and other factories.

This shall include people who drive under influence too and so on. I hope you get the idea which is straightforward and up for feedback.

This is my first post here and I hope we can make this subreddit another way to communicate our wants with our so lost government. May God protect our country from the people who want to do evil acts.

I am neither with nor against drug use. I had my portion of it and took my lessons out of its use, but seeing people jailed for something that is a crime towards themselves alone is unfair. Because you're only harming your soul (if you're a pious person) and your body as you do drugs.

I don't know about drug dealers, but at least drug users should be treated as drug users not as criminals to rot in a prison cell.

If you think this is a joke of an idea, then at least I made someone laugh tonight. But as ironic as it may sound, I think it can make life more enjoyable while it lasts in Tunisia. I'm pretty sure our country will be better if this is to be applied: Feel free to do drugs, but if you're caught, enjoy community service including taking garbage, cleaning the streets, etc...

(This idea came up a few days ago so I thought I should share it. I have not deeply studied its consequences and I hope we will do so together if you think it's a good one. I know for a fact that some countries already have this implemented.)

what if someone develop an app that could stupidly explain all our rules, especially the road law.

for example, did you know: police cannot stop you for speeding if they don't have a radar. 

also, do you know that fighting with a agent while he is working even if he is not actually doing anything (example baladya or bousta). can lead to prison and a fee(I think). because you are not actually his boss. 

also, is it allowed to record a police officer when he stops me? 

if someone develop an app that could actually tell us what is our right and what's our responsibilities, that would actually help us all. 

business model : probably could be financed by law associations and human right ONGs etc..

Between exams, orientation, bac, and graduating you may find yourself spiraling into anxiety trying to make the ""best"" plan possible for your life especially average students from average and poor families trying to break the cycle.

There is no one-size-fits-all solution that will work for everyone in every circumstances. 

Even following someone else's path may limit your horizons especially in less privileged towns and neighborhood where the usual ***Success Stories*** are ""حرق و ورّق"" , ""D-max w شبكة"" and ""جعّل و دقّ مسمار في الحيط"".

My advice for you is to go through [this blog](https://inkyfada.com/ar/genre/%d8%b3%d8%b7%d9%88%d8%b4%d9%8a/) and read every single story and focus on the ones from people in different circumstances than yours. 

There is also this Post that you have to check: [How much you make in Tunisia.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/t2uh96/how_much_do_you_make_per_month/)

Keep your mind open. Consider the paths less traveled.

Back in the 'Bourguiba'  as well as the 'Zin El-Abiidin' eras/regimes, our family got ripped off of a lot of land, land that was obviously not compensated for.  
My grand-pa, who's no longer with us today, actually tried to get some of the land back or get some sort of recompensation but that didn't happen duh for 'obvious reasons'. Today, I aim at getting some of that wealth back, even a fraction of it. I do believe this is possible beause I heard of 'success' stories from people who managed to win such cases.

So I was wondering what does reddit think of it.

Edit2:
The fact that my kids aren't a carbon copy of me is very reassuring to me. I had a sort of rough childhood, and I believe that my kids must make their own decisions, that's what my parents taught me and provided to me.

My point is that immigration might add up to an already existing age/culture gap that could exist between me and my kid, and therefore be the cause of further disruption in this relationship

I have this question because during the Aïd, I wasn't in Tunisia due to studies, so I fested with 2 friends, one from Algeria and the other from Morocco.

We all are studiying law, and when we have time we do what's called a debate: We take a subject  and we have like an ""abitre"" one for, and one against . Since we fested Aïd together, we took time to do one.

And the question was: Do you think that Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia will be one day one country ?

I was designated as the against part, the moroccan girl in favour part and the algerian the abitre.( it doesn't represent our personnal beliefs)

We had a good debate, althought at the end I won, the abitre told us that it was really hard to take a side, she had a lot of good arguments.( He didn't took the decision with his beliefs, but more about the justess of our arguments and our charisma let's say)

ujbyk6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/ujbyk6/is_there_anywhere_online_i_can_learn_romanized/,8,Is there anywhere online I can learn romanized Tunisian Arabic?,"HI all. I just started taking lessons with a tutor for Tunisian Arabic online. I am half Tunisian but was raised in the US and know no arabic at all. I do not intend to learn any MSA. I only want to learn conversational Tunisian arabic so  I can communicate with family, visit Tunisia, and become close to my family's culture.

After taking one informal lesson, the first problem I'm running into is that I am trying to learn pronunciation without knowing how to spell anything in the arabic transliteration (roman script). I hear phrases I'm picking up, like good morning or how are you, but a) it's hard to pronounce it without seeing it on paper, especially for long term practice and b) it's hard to learn because when I'm just learning verbally, I'm having trouble picking up the patterns that help me contextualize what I'm learning.

So how can I go about learning how to spell everything in the transliteration? Can I use resources for other Arabic dialects without it being incorrect in Tunisian Arabic? Tunisian Arabic is so specific, I don't think I can use resources for any other transliterated Arabic. Or is the best way just to learn form my tutor... Any advice is appreciated.

I'd also appreciate any advice on good starting places going forward to learn Tunisian Arabic on my own. I just started two days ago so this is very fresh for me and I don't want to lose steam bc I'm already feeling confused :,) which will probably be an enduring theme.

This also might be a fundamental misundestanding on my part that there is a consistent romanized Tunisian Arabic I can learn off of when it's just based on the phonetic pronunciation of speaking. I do know which numbers translate to what letters, like 7, 5, 3 etc. But I'm wondering about the spelling of the rest of the word, mainly. SORRY IF THIS MAKES NO SENSE. I can also just ask my arabic tutor. ",,,,,,2022-05-06 01:10:25

اتصالات تونس،اورنج واريدو  والتقاوا حول مشروع جديد يكونوا فيه شركاء... والكل برعاية البنك المركزي التونسي.

يقول القائل، كيفاش #Ooredoo ، #Tunisietelecom و #orange إلي هوما مالمفروض منافسين منافسة شرسة على سوق اتصالات صغير نسبيا، يتلقاو في مشروع موحد في الميدان المالي؟

وعلاش في الوضع الاقتصادي الحالي، تجي الحكومة جمعتين لتالي وتصعّب في الحصول على رخصة مؤسسات الدفع وترفع في الضمان المالي من 5 ملايين دينار إلي 10 ملايين دينار لكل طالب لترخيص؟ خاصة وأن هذا الحاجز كان غير موجود في قانون 2001.

وكيفاش احدى هاته الشركات ملي كانت متهمة بالتنصت على المواطنين ولينا نستقبلوا في مديرها بتشريفات رؤساء الدول؟ 

وكيفاش مجلس المنافسة التونسي يتفرج في الشيء هذا وما يتحركش؟

في الحقيقة، تونس، ماهيش بلد المعجزات يتلقاو فيها المنافسين والاعداء لما فيه صالح للبلاد والعباد، تونس ما عندهاش اقتصاد، تونس مجرد سوق مسكر بالقوة، منتصبين فيه مجموعة هدفها الوحيد الربح الخام على حساب النموا (أعملوا طلة هلى الوضع في لبنان).

 في العالم، مؤسسات الدفع، غالبا ما تكون شركات ناشئة تطور تطبيقات تنافس بيها البنوك في ميدان الدفع كيف مثلا شركة PayPal، في تونس الميدان هذا كان طول عمرو كان مخصص للكبار،اللي هوما اصحاب البنوك بيدهم.

فبعد ما ودينا مجمع تمرزيست الي هو فرد وقت مساهم في UBCI, باول ترخيص مؤسسة دفع Via Mobile، اليوم جاء دور الثلاثي، TT, اللي هو من اكبر المجامع في تونس، Ooredo الي ينشط في اكثر من ربع العالم و Orange الي هو رائد في الاتصالات في أفريقيا، بش ياخو ثاني رخصة مؤسسة دفع.
توة بعد كملنا وكلنا الكبارات الكل، نعملو كيما عملنا في باقي القطاعات... نسكرو الباب ورانا و حكاية الرخص هذه حكاية و ننساوها و فرد وقت نعطيو فرصة للثلاثي هذا بش يبداو صفحة جديدة وينساو الماضي اللي شاكيين فيه بعضهم 17 مرة.

 المرة هاذي للشيء ولى بالمفضوح، وأحنا من جهتنا كأول منظمة حرة للدفاع عن المستهلك بش نعملوا المستحيل بش نفضحوهم ونوقفوا هذه المهزلة عند حدها.",,,,,,2022-05-06 11:29:00

I think using the ""zwalism"" as an excuse is the most stupid thing ever and this is why:
1- The people using the metro are most of the time either poor people or students, so the robber is actually stealing from people who are ""zwewla"".
2- If stealing is really caused by poverty, then why are there many politicians and business men who are stealing despite having millions of dollars in their pockets ?
3- If you really want honest ministers and leaders, why then defending thieves? I mean politicians don't fall from the sky, they are from the people. So if the majority of people are defending robbery than the majority of politicians (elected by the same people) will not have a problem with it too.

Here is the original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/uiv9u0/studying\_in\_europe/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/uiv9u0/studying_in_europe/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

And because I got a good feeling about the potential demand, I want to do a poll and better understand the obstacles that are making it hard for North African students to study abroad.  So If you are interested, please fill out the form (it takes literally 1 minute). Please feel free to share it with other people and friends that potentially may be interested. 

Here is the form: [https://forms.gle/ZtupiEZhRutBjhvg6](https://forms.gle/ZtupiEZhRutBjhvg6)

We're 2 brothers and 2 parents with no extended family or anything. We grew so close and in a really loving environment the longest one of us has stayed away from the other three was when my mom (who's been crying on a nearly daily basis since I heard the news) went for a one-week-log work trip abroad so this will be the hardest part for all of us.

They mistranslated our books on the sole purpose of creating division and conquer, ""divide and conquer"" islam united the rebellious tribes, but then they introduced two different races and even calling berbers as more white than Arabs ""at least not negros"" and providing each group benefits according to their ""whiteness"" to cultivate hatred between the natives.


""De Slane’s liberal use of the notion of race helped generals, ethnographers and doctors avoid having to think about more subtle and complex details of Algeria and its history. For this favour, they made Ibn Khaldūn the most authoritative source on the natives; Ibn Khaldūn, mistranslated by de Slane, became the patron saint of experts. In 1870, the French organising a new system of colonial rule turned to the church of Ibn Khaldūn and its ancient truths about the indigènes, as the new colonial laws called them.""

""So it was Islam, not race, that served as the basis for the official disenfranchisement of the indigènes. Again, however, de Slane’s version of Ibn Khaldūn is important. By representing so many things as racial, and time and again inserting race as a key component of Algeria and its history, de Slane’s translation helped the French to racialise Algerian Muslims into two different peoples: Arabs and Berbers. The division reduced the threat of their partnership against the settlers. Although they might not have understood the fine points of Islamic theology or jurisprudence, the colonists knew that the new racialised Islam benefited them. France’s settler colonists were entitled to receive expropriated land at very favourable financial terms. They also enjoyed a legalised system of protections from the natives. Eventually, French colonisation led not only to the pauperisation of the natives, but also to the emergence of a few very large estates and a large number of poor farmers who depended on the colonial state for their economic survival.""",,,,,,2022-05-09 00:00:44

This experience has shaped my dream of getting into development and choosing it as a career. I have even used their Devex program twice now to extract money I gained from doing a bunch of jobs on the platform which were not only relatively easy but also lucrative, and I am still only a teenager.

So basically, a so called ""journalist"" asks people on the avenue. The majority of these people are either mentally ill or ""clocharat"", being taken advantage just to say contreversies in order to increase the number of views ( usually from Algeria). Here are some examples:

1) This is [a typical video of ""bila kinaa""](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ozsVCJDt7z4) (among hundreds of similar videos) where a bunch of ""chleyek"" talk shamelessly about the crimes they did and how the police are still searching to catch them. Well, i will not talk about the multiple ridiculious things said in that video but i just want to know: why didn't the interviewer call the police? Isn't he also considered a partner in the crime since he didn't report these criminals?

2) The second example is ""réalité tunisienne"". This channel really 3amlet l 3ar b hezzen t7in li dziriya. 90% of its subscribers are actually algerians. The comment section of all its videos are filled with algerians (insulting Tunisia of course). This channel of course knows this since youtube shows to the channel manager from what country are his followers. That's why it uses all means to please algerians ( since they outnumber the Tunisian population 4 times) by glorifying Algeria and demeaning Tunisia like in [this video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xdE7BgQYc0A&amp;t=41s). They also don't mind the exploitation of mentally ill and poor tunisians like in [in this video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1aRNyXQELAw) where a girl (who seems having a trauma) delibrately insults Tunisians and express her wish to go to Algeria without giving any reason. This proves that the journalist is maybe the one who tell people what to say in front of the camera.

There are many other terrible videos and examples but i can't mention them all in one post. These channels use the right of free speech in Tunisia (which doesn't exist in other countries) to demonize it. Even boycotting them by tunisians will not harm them since the majority of their followers are foreigners who believe those videos and feel better watching them. And you , are you ok with this? Is there any way to stop this madness? What do you think about this?",,,,,,2022-05-09 22:47:35

I feel like Tunisia is somewhat of an outlier in the Muslim and Arab world. It is more akin to Turkey in the sense that a significant portion of the population is secular, even actively shunning conservative values outright. Even in North Africa, Tunisia stands out; a large difference relative to Algeria, Libya, Mauritania and even Morocco. And of course an even larger difference relative to the East. This is backed up by [research done in 2016](http://www.sigma.tn/upload/1463395132.pdf) (slide 6): In North Africa, Tunisia is the only country where less than a majority of people think of themselves as Muslim first, and in fact, national identity is a far stronger identifier.

Is this generally accurate? If so, is this something Tunisians feel thankful for, or do they lament it and wish to return to a more conservative society?",,,,,,2022-05-13 08:44:36

i am half tunisian living in europe and was in djerba many times.

i was very curious about the refugee situation there. some people i met there  have seen c0rpses on the beach multiple times. still some of them want to leave tunisia.

maybe some of you know a refugee, or you have been one or consider leaving tunisia. i wanted to highlight that situation in a art project and have some questions....

&amp;#x200B;

what exact situations in your life made you or the people you know want to leave the country?

(for example: medical treatment wasnt affordable and it lead to a relative passing away because of that)

what where you carrying in your bag when leaving the country? (example: passport or do you destroy your passport, snacks, photos,..)

where you leaving with a small boat? what where you leaving with?

where you leaving alone or with other people? how many went with you?

what problems arised while on boat/in a car /etc?

have you heard from people who went away ever since?

have you actually lost someone because this person passed away while fleeing? how you found that out?

what was your destination? where were u going from? how long it took you till you arrived your destination?

As such, i haven't yet had the chance to explore the world and its many different countries and cultures. For 2022, my New Year's resolution is to try to change that. 

I created this account to visit one new country/city/state subreddit each day to just ask, what's up? What's going on where you live? How's life like, what good or bad thing just happened, new music, cultural phenomenons, really anything goes. Open ended discussions are welcome, as are random facts about your country's national bird or what you had for dinner today! 

My goal here is to simply broaden my horizons. By this time next year, i hope to be able to look at any country and know just a little bit more about it than i do now, and have just a slightly better understanding of what life is actually like in places other than my own.

I'll start with the country closest to mine and work my way out. Today I'm visiting r/Tunisia. So, what's up?

If you'd like to join me on my journey, just click my profile and go read the comments from the other subs I've been to. Maybe you too can learn just slightly more about the world around you. 

Cheers, your friendly neighborhood Norwegian.",,,,,,2022-05-16 04:44:03

I’m American- widowed and divorced; fiancé is Algerian- never married. Curious about the documents and time frame for marrying in Tunisia compared to having him come to the US on a tourist visa and marrying in America. 

Birth certificate less than 30 days old seems tricky to coordinate with the issuing county and the flight itinerary. Not certain how to orchestrate the timing. Any suggestions?

As well, do I need both marriage certificates or only the death certificate and divorce decree?

As far as blood tests, which STIs do they test for? And if one of us tests positive, what next? (Note: as an American I test regularly and it remains negative, so I’m more curious about my partner who has never tested.) The entire point of meeting in Tunisia is to wed quickly so I don’t want to waste a trip. If there is a positive test, it’s not necessarily a deal breaker for me- trying to think of all possible scenarios. Nonetheless, I want to confirm if the government would reject our request to marry. 

Lastly, after all this, does it make more sense to apply for the K1 fiancé visa and marry in America or marry in Tunisia and apply for the immigrant spousal visa? We’re both Muslim so we’ll be seeing the imam in Tunisia regardless (for religious marriage, not civil).

I don't see the point really , I know that French is not widely spoken worldwide and most people suck at it (me included) , but I don't see it as a problem , I understand English scientific books and courses just fine as the technical and scientific terms are not that much different except for some words .    
We have the chance to study in English and French speaking countries so that's a plus too.  


If we had the ability to just simply switch to English I would prefer that , but I don't see it as an ""emergency"" that we have to get rid of  , Especially that it would take ages and lots of money to do such a thing (Unless we're reverting to teaching Maths in Arabic xD) .

its just like changing from a language to another both having their popularity because of colonization
if we yes and we should remove them then sure but don't use it then in derja which have italian french and english words from it because they are foreign
and if yes then remove the arabic from derja as it is also a colonization which was done long ago and so like the french should be banned

the logic is bad 
we see french as an outdated language but if we ban it in public schools then private schools will dispense it and they will be a mark of a class only the weathly will speak french and that will be a sign of prestige

a better idea is to increase languages study make it flexible
teach derja instead of arabic make reform in it dont make an academie of derja it will get worse but allow the teaching to follow the speaking and evolution of the language

teach french english and arabic and apply them in domains like in philosophy where they read texts of the three languages same with scientific and other fields so they could integrate into the world scientific and thinking system easily

make derja with latin alphabet similar to french and english script with some characters similar to arabic with same meaning
as latin alphabet has vowels it can help ease comprehension for beginners by removing ambiguity while by using arabic script it help to know and ease arabic characters like the ° can be replaced by the  ' as it is already used in hawaiian to mean a stop
and so on
if u want the language to survive 
it is not by removing languages and making it stale out of date
but by reading and incorporating other languages loan words and other

teach in school how humans normaly speaks and whats the pronounciation differences there is 
and many other ideas 
it can be a great way to allow people to learn new languages and be a way for us to be updated and always having different outlook on life

Should I just never bother recharging it again, such a shame considering I was pondering switching over from ooredoo to escape the intense sms spam and the obtuse sunday 9am biweekly samma3ni call.

Edit: turns out they were using the sim toolkit app to create these popups, the app can be disabled safely however it requires some fiddling around with adb.

If you're stuck with Orange as a provider here's a guide on how to do that [https://hybridsim.com/delete-sim-toolkit/](https://hybridsim.com/delete-sim-toolkit/) you can have multiple of these apps if you have multiple sims .  make sure to disable the app instead of yanking it, they might pull something in the future.",,,,,,2022-05-18 13:35:55

utg3eb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/utg3eb/resume_cv_and_cover_letter_time/,11,Resume (CV) and cover letter time,"Hello all. As it's mainly time for students to find summer jobs/internships (actually a bit late for that tbh..) or masters programs and for workers to start preparing for the new position they want in the upcoming year, a big question comes up: how to properly write a resume and a cover letter? I know that usually people think they know how to do it, and maybe you do even better than me, but I'll be frank and honest: being surrounded by people who own companies/hotel directors etc. I heard too many ""what the fuck is this shit""s while reviewing resumes to know that it's not the case for a good part of the population.

So, I guess this is mainly aimed towards highschoolers/university students looking for internships and starting positions (or programs within other universities). For higher positions, it's slightly different.

# Resume/CV

The CV (curriculum vitae) is THE thing you always need to have ready and updated.

* Unless you have +25 years of experience and a PhD (or stuff like that), it should never be longer than one page.
* Keep it sober. Unless you're a design/marketing student or something along those lines, don't use 10 colours and fonts. [This](https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/themes/x5-child/assets/images/templates/template5.jpg) type of presentation is perfectly acceptable for example. If you want to add some more colours, [Canva.com](https://Canva.com) has a couple of interesting templates. So do Word and Google Docs.
* A picture of the candidate is not obligatory, but often appreciated (especially by boomer employers). Don't put up a selfie. You don't need to specifically be wearing a tux either, you just have to look professional (I've seen resumes with Retrica profile pictures and/or pictures that date back to people's early 2000's emo tumblr phase. Don't do that.). If you choose to put up a picture, a recent one is more than appreciated. Basically, just ask someone to take a picture of you in front of a white wall, or a nice, clean scenery, with you wearing business/business casual clothes and a welcoming smile.
* Don't put up your full address. You can say in which city/country you live, your mail and eventually your phone number in a small ""contact"" frame. Sometimes the phone number is to be avoided (especially for women) to avoid harassment, but on the other hand it helps if the employer wants a phone interview.
* Start with the most recent activity. EX: you finished your studies in 2007, and have been working ever since. The first frame is going to be about your **work experience**, from the most recent the oldest (ex: Community Manager-Oreedoo-Tunis- from 2015 to 2022, then underneath it Freelance Photographer-Tunis- from 2008 to 2015 etc.).
* The second frame is going to be about your **studies**: where did you study-what diploma-what year. Some people like to add if they had hounours (""mention bien/très bien"") but it only really matters if you came from a really good school or if it was an important diploma (implying a thesis or something along those lines).
* Third frame is going to be about your **associative work/internships** (highschool students, you can shine in here, you can bring up all the Rotaract, Youth Club, TIMUN experience etc.). First job seekers, you'd rather put up your internships, even if associative work is appreciated too as it shows you have a life and an actual personality that seeks activity.
* Then, usually on the side, **language mastery**: what languages do you speak/read/write. If you have a certification (IELTS, Goethe Zertifikat, DALF...), put the result. There is usually a european (now worldwide) recognised way of marking that goes from A1 (lowest level) to C2 (highest level). Otherwise, you can rely on Linkedin's way of describing things (from ""basic understanding of the language"" to ""mother tongue"" passing by ""professional proficiency""). You can also do a similar frame if you code, and bring up the programming languages you master.

!! I would say to avoid the technique used by some people where you use stars or dots as a way of expressing your proficiency. seeing ""English: \*\*\*\*\*/ French: \*\*\*"" doesn't really mean a lot.

!!! Underneath each experience, explain in a line or two what exactly it is that you did during your time there. Example: ""wrote contracts in French and Arabic/Walked clients through the creation of their companies/ Collected and analysed data for the firm"" or ""I had the role of communicating to the public the association's activity, explaining our charity related work, designing leaflets and helping my coworkers' intentions better go through""

As important as a resume is, usually employers receive hundreds of them and they barely have time to take a look. So keep it simple, clean, make sure there is no grammar mistakes, no need to overcomplicate things.

# The cover letter

Cover letters are an invention from the devil itself. More often than not, you'll find yourself feeling like you're begging for the job/program/internship and it's frustrating, because well, what reason do you have other than ""money"" or ""I need to finish my degree lol"" right? Welp, it doesn't mean it's okay to bullshit your way through, no one believes letters where the candidate is claiming they ""adore tax law and would love to spend a summer learning how to better use Excel"". So there are a couple of rules here too, but it's more ""free"".

**Note:** if you're applying in anglosaxon countries, they often ask for 2 types of letters, in one of them you literally are allowed to tell about your whole life and explain the whys and hows you even thought of applying there. But let's stay in Tunisia for now.

* 2 pages max. Times New Roman. Font 11/12 (10.5 if you really have a lot to say). All in black.
* Written like a letter. Your name/surname, your identity (ex: 3rd year student at Lycée pilote bourguiba) your mail on the upper-left. The identity of the employer right underneath, on the right (""à l'aimable attention de monsieur/madame \*name\*), their position. Then back to normal way of writing. You put the object of the letter: ""candidature à...."".
* There are different types of schemes you can follow. There is the regular Me/You/Us: you explain who you are first (your background education and interests etc.), then briefly say what exactly interests you in that company/program and then say what the both of you together could look like (ex: if you already know what memoir you'd like to write, if there is a dream job you think you could discover through that internship etc.). You can expand more or less on each part, (if you want to talk more about yourself because you really think that your background is what's going to make the difference for example). It's basically a seducing game.
   * Keep it SIMPLE. The most terrible cover letter I've seen was from a dude that used words he definitely didn't understand with never-ending sentences that didn't make sense. He seemed genuine but for the position he seeked, that definitely wasn't okay. SO, a normal ""I'm a student at such school. I am adressing this application for an internship between the weeks of the 3rd of may 2022 and the 23rd of june 2022. (always specifiy your available dates). My \*background education\* armed me with \*such and such qualities and knowledge\*. I deeply believe that I am a fit candidate as my capacity of \*working hard/regularly/continuously/learning fast...\* would be most profitable"" etc.
   * Never forget formal salutations. Example: ""Dans l’attente d’une réponse que j’espère positive de votre part, je vous prie d’agréer, monsieur/madame, l’expression de ma considération distinguée""

# DOs:

* Send the documents in PDF format
* Write a proper e-mail alongside (not just an empty mail with the documents in it)
* Get a third party to check the spelling for you
* Be confident and go for it :)
* Look up the company and its history to see what are they looking for. Don't retell them their own history, but use the key words in their website and on their job application form to make your application pop out. Some big firms don't even read applications anymore as they receive thousands of them (usually banks, big tech companies and all) but use AIs to filtrate the first couple dozen ""okay"" applications. There are websites used to see if your application can pass this filter, I'll see if I can find them. ",,,,,,2022-05-19 23:32:49

I just saw a tiktok about a house in Hammamet  called dar el bhar. 

It looks expensive🤣, but ive never seen such a beautiful house like that in tunisia !

Maybe you know a few beautiful vacation stays...

I prefer something with a nice view and this traditional/clean Mix just like the dar el bhar. 
But i also like those cave hotels in chenini.
Modern is also fine.

An extra point would be something like a Pool indoors, so women with hijab can perfectly enjoy swimming or relaxing as well. Some Private places have a Patio with Pool, thats okay as well.


Ive also seen tik toks of tourists in tunisia going to Restaurants and Cafés with a beautiful city/ sea view and very beautiful Architecture and artsy Mosaic everywhere. 
But no one actually wants to tell where they were! 
Maybe you can also Name me some of the most beautiful Cafés or Restaurants 🤣

uujkzq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/uujkzq/psa_check_if_there_are_unrecognized_sim_cards/,39,PSA: Check if there are unrecognized SIM cards registered under your CIN IMMEDIATLY.,"Using a SIM card registered under your name use the USSD code  **\*186#** to list all the SIM cards registered with **your CIN** on ***THAT NETWORK***.

If you have multiple SIMs on different Networks do it on each on of them.

Check for your parents and family too.

You are legally liable to anything done using any SIM card registered under your CIN even if you don't recognize it or claim it was lost.

Many sad stories of innocent people being involved into criminal and even national security related investigations because of ""ghost"" SIMs linked to them.

Losing a copy of your CIN is not something negligible or simple.

SIM street salesmen are paid commission per SIM sold. Many of them, as you can guess from the way they harass you on the sidewalk, don't respect the rules and don't stick to the procedure. Some will turn a blind eye as long as they get the commission.

You don't want to find out that your ID has been stolen the hard way like this guy that lost his passport, visa, and job offer abroad and now under ""National Security"" investigations because his ""lost"" SIM card from ""ايامات المبيت"" was used by some criminals.

PS: if you unfortunately found some rogue SIMs under your name do not burn them on the spot. Go to the network provider boutique and ask the agent for when was the last activity of the SIM and if it coincides with your last use then it's ok, just burn it.

But if it is currently being used you may consider reporting it the police if it is being heavily used. Ask the agent for the frequency of the balance recharge since they ""can't"" officially give you the call history without a formal request.

Heavily used stolen SIM usually means the user is selling illegal products.

PS2: Do NOT register any phone on Sajalni.tn for other people. Only register the phones you bought for you or your family.

Some scammers will claim forgetting about the [sajalni.tn](https://sajalni.tn) registration and post in expat groups asking ""who landed in Tunisia recently and can register my phone pleeeeeeeeeease"".

Once an  **IMEI**  is registered under your passport you are liable if the phones where stolen from abroad or if after that been used by criminals (you will be the last known suspect) .

To check if a phone is ""legal"" in Tunisia use   **\*999#**",,,,,,2022-05-21 09:25:30

Are there any other options for unlimited 4G availabilities? Most of the Orange and Oredoo unlimited plans aren't available in that area... hoping there's something else we're not aware of.

More often than not, I found myself scrolling up and down, going through meanless content and double-tapping some fake ass pictures of fake ass lives.Instead of keeping up with shallow friendships through memes sharing, bragging about the “perfect” happy life I’m not living and pouring my heart out to an audience that couldn’t care less about my existence. Instead of that, I thought to myself maybe.. just maybe I’ll have to shut all that shit down and give real life a shot.

The website ""strategy"" is to attract talented streamers (singer, dancers, comedians, etc...) so viewers will watch something interesting. 

However, if you filter by countries, almost exclusively ALL 3rd world countries (arabs included) are using the website as a Live-Sex tool where they start a private group or 1:1 and just offer live sex for gifts, it's crazy how many girls are from Morocco and Egypt, but Tunisia is also a good competitor (especially at night).

Is it because serbia is visa-free for tunisians? If yes, then this is really ridiculous.

v0w6gv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/v0w6gv/this_is_what_ive_learned_about_crypto_so_far/,2,This is what I've learned about crypto so far,"I've seen people interested in cryptocurrencies in this sub in the last couple of weeks and thought maybe it would be interesting for some people to have read what I've learned so far. 

Crypto is based on blockchain technology (almost like a shared database between different clients) which is really interesting and innovative.

Its main goal is to have a decentralized currency used world wide and from person to person (p2p) with no intermediate (third party) meaning the crypto (like bitcoin) is not controlled by a company or a governement which is super great.

Crypto has gained power due to trades : people buying and selling crypto hoping to gain money and usually do because more and more people are getting intrested and investing in crypto.

Cryptocurrencies have multiple goals here's some of them :   
 \- Blockchains : Bitcoin, Ethereu, Solana ... : They built their own blockchain so that people can transfer money throught it.   
 \- Stablecoins : USDC, Tether ... : they imitate the US dollar. It is a form of asset (like gold)   
 \- Decentralized apps : Curve, Aave, Compound : Built on blockchains, they offer multiple financial services like trading or stacking and saving money 

Some other offer very innovative goals like Theta with its streaming platform built on blockchain, saving data on blockchain with filecoin, and blockchain based games like axie infinity or sandbox and of course NFTs (I dont like them) that are unique digital assets.   

My POV : Crypto is an intresting technology but it is mostly used for trading crypto it gets ruined sometimes by noobs, media and whales (rich investors). And when this happen the market go down and all people start to think that crypto is a scam.

Hope this helped someone out here ;)",,,,,,2022-05-30 09:14:02

1/ Will a 9000 BTU Inverter AC be enough for my 16m² room? Remember that we reached 50°C last summer! will it struggle or keep up? Would it be safer to go for 12K BTU or is that an overkill?

2/ Which brand is the best option with these parameters: 9000 BTU inverter. I saw ""Gree"" going at 1650dt and there are other brand at this price range: ""Midea"" ""Coala"" ""Condor"".. I'm really confused as I have no prior experience.

I can't afford to go private schools, so I'm going to a public school, talked to the staff in one of the schools in my state and I meet all conditions to apply. Thing is, they are limited on options for me. Basically I have 1 option, to become an electrician (construction electrician, not industrial). For now that's what's available in my state, haven't looked in other areas because I can't afford to move out and rent somewhere else. 

  
Regardless of everything, is getting a diploma as an electrician worth it, the reason why I thought about it is because I read and heard it's in demand in Canada mainly.  If anyone could offer some advice, whether I'm making a good choice here or not, if you guys have any suggestions about what to study in relation to mainly leaving the country but also in case that doesn't workout something that'll be useful in Tunisia as well.

I'll be traveling to Tunisia at the end of the summer for the first time in my life and I'm trying to find a list of prohibited drugs for the country. I know Arabic countries have extremely strict drug laws so I have to make sure I'm not bringing anything that can get me in jail.  


Could someone find a list for me? I tried looking for a list in English but I couldn't find anything. I know the major drugs like Marijuana, Cocaine, Amphetamines, and so on are illegal but I'm trying to figure out the legal status of some less widespread drugs that's why I need a detailed list of ALL the illegal substances.

Also one more thing and that is that the majority of Tunisians don't really understand that the country is at best ""an average country"" so their continuous complaining sounds a bit like a 4th degree team fans complaining why their team doesn't win the Premier League (in which they don't even play) 🤔 😴 🤷",,,,,,2022-06-02 09:53:46

I gave all the information they needed i.e. the address of the place I will stay at (my friend’s one) and the reason of my stay (I wrote tourism). At the airport, I gave it to a customs policeman who checked it and told me very angrily that I couldn’t write a private address if I’m a tourist and it had to be a hotel. I panicked and I gave the closest hotel to my friend’s place but I’m actually not staying there at all. Does it mean they will check if I actually booked a place at this hotel ? Do I risk anything ?

I enjoy studying speeches and his are a little bit old school but the content is actually pretty good. like all good speeches he is tangential to the populist discourse (which is a bad term nowadays for some reason).

His actions are pretty effective and straightforward and he doesn't seem to care a lot about economy or maybe he just doesn't refer to it a lot.

Which I think is the best way to go about politics. I feel like the economism obsession of our people (all the Maghreb) is dumb and unproductive, as we all know that a good government structure will surely create a functioning economy. Not the opposite. 

Im guessing that the referendum will try to give the executive branch some more power to act, the opposition will use the ""Dictator"" card.

- General introduction
- Some historical facts with a special focus on recent events (From independence to now)
- Fun facts (or achievements done by Tunisians)
- Common misconceptions
- Touristic places and sites
- Food and Culture

I would really appreciate if you could help me in some of the parts, especially the Fun facts and Common misconceptions, so if you have something, leave it in the comments below.

Also, what do you think would be an original and creative way to make this presentation ? I don't want to do it in boring PowerPoint slides, I would like something more interactive; I am planning on including a quiz at the end, but if you have other suggestions, I would appreciate it.

Thank you!",,,,,,2022-06-03 23:26:35

- I'm checking the buses timetable in this website http://www.srtgn.com.tn/site/template.php?code=21, but can't figure out where they depart from and where they stop. Is this information available somewhere online?


- I'm checking the intercity trains timetable in this website https://www.sncft.com.tn/en/search-result/. Compared to the information available on Google Maps, they are different. Should I trust Google Maps in this case? I'm planning on using a lot of the trains with the Carte Bleue.


- I need to be in Yasmine Hammamet around 09:30 in the morning. I'll be staying in Tunis, so the train isn't an option. I heard there's a bus going from Tunis to Hammamet. Can anyone tell me where it departs from, where it stops and how long the trip takes?


- I thought about using Bolt or regular taxi from Tunis city center to Yasmine Hammamet, as it seems to cost less than 20 euros. Are drivers willing to make such a long trip or should I forget about this?

It's actually quite sad because many tunisian dishes have the potential to make great vegan dishes. I can't imagine a tourist coming here who doesn't speak Arabic or french being able to survive on a vegan diet, maybe if they only eat baguettes and olive oil. When you ask someone is this dish vegetarian you can't trust their answer, ever because often times fish and even chicken is seen as vegetarian (?)

I was asked to do a ""declaration de soutien financier"" for him which was fine. 

Then this agency asked for some very personal documents including my ""fiche de paye"" and my bank statements for the past year... and some other documents.

Knowing that this relative has already a ""compte bloqué"" in the name of his father (100k) and  already provided a ""declaration de soutien financier"" from a Canadian citizen and also some document proving the ownership of a house and a piece of land... I started to find this really exaggerated and it did not make any sense to me. 

I went through the Canadian l portal for immigration and tried to simulate the process to check what documents are really required because I'm not just gonna take some agency's word for it as my bank statements contain some sensitive data like my IBAN for instance, my social security number, my tax identifier and medical insurance . None of these documents are officially asked for! When I talked to this relative he said that agency told him that Canada wants to discourage immigration from algeria and tunisia so they do not put all the required documents on the website just to refuse immigration requests later .. which makes even less sense. Here is a link to what I found concerning the officially required documents.

I'm Tunisian and would like to hear how much would a 2 bed room flat cost in Tunis and greater Tunis ?

I live in Switzerland. My wife is Tunisian, and I am in love with Tunisia. I would like to invest (to support locals and create good jobs) in a project in Tunisia (maybe Tunis, Djerba or Hamamet area). Here is what I want:

1. I know Lebanese food and Tunisians and Tourists love it. However, there is a lot of room to take it further.
2. The restaurant theme is the [glamorous Lebanese Lifestyle in the 1960s](https://www.vintagebeirut.com/fashion-style/beirut-byblos-baalbek/)
3. This business is not about selling food!  
***I want to sell an outstanding and unique experience &gt; living the glamour of Beirut in 1960:***
   1. You feel like: ""You land in Beirut, you step out of the plane"" ... and enter the Restaurant
   2. You hear Fairouz, you smell Beirut Winds and Sandal and Cedar Wood, the Garçons are dressed up with a [Lebanese Tarboush](https://www.vintagebeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Beirut-Lebanon-1962-Vintage-gelatin-silver-print-40-x-30-cm.jpg) (similar to Shashia) and will welcome you with a refresher Drink.
   3. Furthermore, you are being treated like a King &amp; Queen. We even take off your Jacket and escort you to the table.
   4. There will be Theme events: Lebanese Mawwal, Classical Oud &amp; Poetry Evenings, Romantic Candlelight Dinners, Family Sundays, and of course: Hardcore Lebanese Dabke and maybe VIP events with famous Lebanese Singers...
   5.  Marketing: We will have a [GlamBot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NzcMfXTiLk), a photo-wall for Instagram, so that the people create a hype (with a hashtag) about this restaurant and make it go viral in Tunisia etc.
   6. The Restaurant is completely data-driven (everything is measured with data including customer feedback to constantly improve the experience.
4. My target customers are the upper class of Tunisia and high income individuals and Tourists who are willing to enjoy this experience
5. Target size: 50-100 Guests with around 25 Tables and 10-15 employees

  
**Here is my Question**

How much initial Budget do you think is needed to finance this for the first 6 Months, including costs for rent of the venue/space (excluding the GlamBot) ?

I would be happy for every feedback! Thank you so much!

A month later, ""el reseaux 9as"" and no phone calls or *???# can be established. Which (after asking a proffesional) seemed to be caused by the fact that the phone's IMEI wasn't saved in https://www.sajalni.tn/ . In other words , the phone wasn't made in Tunisia (And I just found out that they do this procedure to prevent smuggled phones from being bought and used normally). I talked to the guy back on facebook marketplace, and the negotiation didn't go very well.

Another person tried helping me out (A professional has told me that you need someone who came to tunisia in the last 3 months from another country). But it seems like it didn't work. After asking, another friend of mine , he sent me [this](https://thd.tn/demande-denregistrement-rejetee-sur-sajalni-voici-ce-quil-faut-faire/), which seems to suggest that I need that someone to actually be in Tunisia in order to fix the problem in the CERT office (thanks to our amazing online services).

But I would like to ask (or rather complain) why young (as &lt;40 yo) people sit in cafes constantly. I feel like it’s the only entertainment they have.

To majority of people going out means going to cafe. When it’s time to leave house the question that arises is not “What should we do?”, but “Which cafe are we going to?”. 

No walks, no nature, no other social activities. No cinema, bowling, museum or sports. Nothing. Just sitting in cafes for hours. Sometimes not even speaking to each other, just scrolling the phones together. I know I generalise right now, but I feel like way more than 50% of young people live this way.

From what I was told, it wasn’t like that 20 years ago. It’s quite new thing, but why was it adapted so easily? Because it’s a cheap entertainment with the price of a coffee?",,,,,,2022-06-10 09:32:42

I've had a couple ""almost"" romantic relationship experiences  but the more i grow up, it feels to me like ""naah, meeh! I just don't feel like it, I am better off alone"". I mean like I don't even have the willingness or the slightest longing to being in a relationship anymore. I basically came to the point where I see no use of it. I am just fine on my own, i want to make friends and live a free life, without having to be tied up to someone. Just wanna be ""tranquille"". 
I literally lost all sight of what can the advantages of being in a relationship or marriage be. And even when I see those advantages, none of them tempt me, because I know the amount of disadvantages that come along with those, too. The amount of commitment, and the loss of freedom. Modern Romantic relationships are very tangling. Sometimes I day-dream about being loved, in love and with someone, but I am literally always happier, cooler, more balanced when I am single. Who's here like me?

Edit : I am not posting this as if it's a problem or a complaint. I am just stating my situation just how it is, neutrally. And just wanting to see how many of my fellow Tunisians might be feeling the same. You know.. maybe it's a social phenomenon? 🤔",,,,,,2022-06-10 12:30:24

In 15 mins you can be sure you are a considered a  مواطن.

Make sure your personal information are correct and that you are registered to vote.

All you need is you' CIN and a phone number.

&amp;#x200B;

***PS***: 

Some political parties are encouraging people to not register to vote as way to protest, but, in reality they are making sure people can't vote yes if the proposed constitution is actually better than the one that led us to this shitty situation.

All I'm calling for is to register. 

Don't be a sheeple. 

Yes or No it doesn't matter for me. You can even register and not go. 

Although, I hate seeing our youth in lines in front of the gambling stores and only the elderly in the voting centers.

It's not my first time in Africa, and not my first time in a third world country. My first visit to Africa was awesome, and what motivated me to come back. But being in Tunisia is 80% stress and 20% fun. 

I lost count of how many times someone tried to scam me. Taxi drivers, ""guides"", sellers, random people in the streets... Everyone is just trying to get money from me. Today I stepped foot out of my hotel and got approached by a scammer literally after I crossed the street. Seconds after leaving the hotel. 

I had planned to visit several cities in the northern part of the country, but that has also been a failure. I tried to get a train to El Jem and gave up after it was delayed for 2 and a half hours. I could go with a driver or a louage, but God knows how they would scam me. Same for the bus, because I'm pretty sure one of my fellow passengers would try to get some money from me. 

I do believe that the country has several interesting things to see and do, but it's quite hard to do that when public transportation simply doesn't work and you can't leave your hotel without feeling like a walking target for scammers. 

I don't want to leave my hotel room and don't dare trying to buy a postcard or fridge magnet, because they will probably try to charge me 50 euros for that. 

I do understand that everyone in the country is pretty poor and miserable, and Corona only made things worse. But this is the kind of behavior that will make tourists think twice about coming to Tunisia.

So, for me, unfortunately Tunisia sucked and I feel like I threw my money in the toilet by coming here.",,,,,,2022-06-11 11:27:00

Fawzi repented one day and declared ""tawba"" and that was good.

He should ask for forgiveness and try to go back to the right path of God and he will receive help if he is honest. 

Until then he is sinful and mistaken but it is nobody's business. Definitely not the business of Tunisian journalists and celebrities and ""influencers"" who themselves lack lives and base their life stories on what happen in other people's lives.

**In theory** (according to news relayed by a hefty number of tunisians) **:**

Tunisia is the best African country in terms of ease of doing business, flexible startup environnement, digitalization en veux tu en voila, educated people, polylinguism, personal freedom, transparency, and whatnot.

**When In reality :**

The country is becoming a breeding ground for lawlessness and corruption, Youngers are fleeing the country for an infinity of reasons, Regulators are not proactive in the slightest, we (as a whole) don't even have a full command of the arabic language let alone french and english, we allegedly have 20% of illiteracy, police and welfare are a joke.

Are the laws/ courts affected by religion like we have in Jordan is what I'm asking.

second: i asked the police about the time i'd have to wait for it to be ready and they said ""hkeya fergha tfoutech 10 ayem"", is that true?  
last: my id doesnt have undergrad (etudiant) status, would that be a problem? do i need to change my id first?

So few questions are:

1. Which bands are considered the most famous metal bands in the country?
2. Are there any bands that sing only in Tunesian Arabic or Arabic and how famous are those bands?
3. What is the music industry generally like and how hard or easy is for metal bands in it?
4. Where do you metal people hang out? Where are the good shows? How often are there big shows? How is the scene as a metal musician or a metal fan?  
I mean all these questions in the best of sense of course I just want to hear from your prespective.

And of course if you live in Tunesia and you have a metal band don't hesitate to put it in the comment for me.

The little guy isn't as little as to being able to travel with me in-cabin, he's sadly over 8kg, without considering the weight of the transport crate.

I'm looking for people who have done this kind of thing before and how was their experience, especially during layovers. I am worried about his behavior in the cargo hold in the dark while alone. My dog has a little case of separation anxiety, and i'm currently still training him to be comfortable in the crate, which isn't going that well to be quite honest with you, I'm not seeing any tangible results that would alleviate my worries.

almost every week here we see a post titled ""[A question](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/vh9f85/a_question/)"" or ""[I need help](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/vf59kr/i_need_help/)""

The 1st post is asking about a scholarship to germany, and the second about his lost D17 password, and like i said, it happens weekly now.

People should write a self explanatory titles

1.  its for your own benefits btw, because people who really have the knowledge about your topic, when they read the title, they will have more incentive to help, if you don't, you increase the chance of these people missing your question, AND, you end up getting replies from people who randomly open posts just out of curiosity. 

2. if helps the community, googling tunisian shit literally doesn't work, and this is one of the reasons of it, if you write your title correctly, it will eventually appear in google search, and future people may find their answers.  

&amp;nbsp;

tagging all the mods because i don't know the most active ones: 

/u/Enti_San /u/flesmih /u/TeraVonen /u/Lbachch /u/djerbi /u/Stalked_Like_Corn

My current solution for this is to add a ""bad title"" report option so we can help with the cleaning, also I believe bots can detect that, many subs already have this implemented.

- the Capital province (Tunis (capital city), Ariana, Ben arous, Manouba, bizerte, zaghouan)

- the coastal province (nabeul, sousse, monastir, mahdia , sfax)

- the southern province (gabes, medenine, tataouine, kebili, tozeur, gafsa)

- the north western province (beja, kef, siliana, jendouba, kasserine, sidi bouzid, kairouan)

All of these provinces will have a huge potentiel to be developped. For example:

- The southern province will be very rich if not the richest thanks to the petroleum, gaz, and phosphates ressources in tataouine and gafsa.

- the capital and coastal provinces are already more developped and have access to the sea and a big touristic infrastructure. Also, a city like Sfax have huge gaz fields.

- the north-western province despite its lack of natural ressources have a huge agriculture sector. Also, having a border with algeria can help them by trading with them.

The federalism will solve the problem of favorising a region over another. Also it can limit the spread of corruption. Each province will assume its own responsibility and they will only blame themselves in case of failure.",,,,,,2022-06-22 15:09:37

vi9i28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/vi9i28/an_open_letter_to_a_muslim_tunisian/,20,An Open Letter To a Muslim Tunisian,"If this statement doesn’t sit right with you keep reading.

This is a statement by the Tunisian president that looks like he’s playing with words, he sounds like he’s trying to defend secularism with Islam, I know this sounds weird but I hope it won’t by the end of this letter.

In his quick response, he is making the distinction between the Islamic Ummah and the Tunisian country, The most basic and important difference is that the Ummah can only be ruled by “Amir al-Mu'minin” who is appointed by a “Bay'ah”, which is a sovereign ruler that’s only accountable to god, on the other hand, the modern concept of a country is a body that claims to be sovereign, but in reality, this country is accountable to the most powerful countries indirectly and the laws of the united nations directly (Ironically the united nations is the one issuing this fake sovereignty “حق الشعوب في تقرير مصيرها”), even if this outside influence means to go against the Islamic law.

The cognitive dissonance and the unproductive division that this dynamic creates is by far the first reason why the Arab countries never had and will never have stable political races to power, and will always be on the brink of a civil war.

Ergo, the fight around being an Islamic country (which is what Islamist democrats want) or a secular one (which is ironically what the other democrats want) is just a dumb game that will result in the same result every time whether you’re labeled a “secular” or not, the real game must be played somewhere else, this is not a position against Islam, this is a position against the system.

The perversion of the concept of “Islam is the religion of the country” by the so-called “Islamic” democrats became so apparent in the last few years. We see that it became a slogan to use in emotional speeches with no substance (much like BLM or any other slogan that no one can *literally* disagree with) to just rally people behind them.

This movement that controlled the government for so long is the manifestation of the global order inside the country, removing them reduces the influence of such powers, and gives those powers back to the real ruler, after all, If you want to be *ruled fairly,* first of all, you need to be *ruled*.

Stop taking democracy for granted, I’ve seen many of you supporting the idea of a dictatorship in a bid to rid Islam from the constitution is quite stupid and alienating when you yourselves have been liberated from such a thing in 2011.If you really think religion of all things is a bigger problem then say living standards or the economy and would be willing to give your democratic nation for the sake of an article which does absolutely nothing then you are irrational.

I'm studying the origin of ancient Carthage. I am trying to understand a reference in Josephus (in against Apio) to a battle between the king of Tyre and the ""euchii or titii"" people. Scholars don't know what to make of it: they usually assume that ""titii"" is ""tyrians"" (people of Tyre), but that is nonsense: the letters are wrong, and why would the king of Tyre fight himself? Soon after this the queen of Tyre founded Carthage in ancient Tunisia, so I won exploring the idea that ""Titti"" could be ""titans"", i.e., people of Atlas, i.e. Atlas Mountains, Tunisia. (Also known as Atlantians!) The theory  depends on the meaning of ""euchii"" or people of Euch. The only reference I can find to ""euch"" is the ""bir el euch"" well in Tunis. Is this well ancient? Watering holes were very important in ancient times: the ""euchii"" would be the people of the region called ""euch"", around the euch well. But if the well is not ancient then that destroys my theory. :) I know nothing about the bir el euch. Is it ancient? Was euch a name for the region? Does anybody know?",,,,,,2022-06-23 10:04:15

Those who don’t manage to get it will look for other opportunities by themselves. Saudi Arabia universities have heard about this so they started receiving students from EPT for a master degree. The universities are mainly KFUPM (petroleum and minerals studies) and KAUST (science and technology). Here’s the trick many teachers there are Americans and occupy/have occupied important positions in top American universities. So if you manage to build good relationships with your teachers and have good marks, they’ll vouch for you to get a phd contract in USA (with or without scholarships doctorates are always paid because they work in research labs or as assistant teachers).

Im Scottish but live in Germany and know many Tunisians here and also I tried to learn some Tunisian dialect this year so talked to people online and would really love to visit Tunisia soon!! (Also it’s weird but also I’ll do my masters on soils in North Africa)

They are the most patient people I’ve ever met, also passionate and proud people; very confident and don’t let people take advantage of them, they are super friendly but you also have to be able to take a joke because they make fun of everything (I like that because it’s the same in Scotland but here in Germany it’s not common) and always extremely competitive and sometimes like gossip (but not two faced, they will just tell you what they said about you lol). Also the friendships of Tunisians I find to be so sweet, they will lend you money or give you a place to stay no questions asked etc which is much different to people in Europe. 

Every Tunisian I met was light hearted and fun (bearing in mind I’ve only met/talked to Tunisians in their 20s) obviously these are generalisations and I don’t think EVERY Tunisian is like this, but I just mean this is the general vibe I get :) you can also tell me your perception of Scots if you want !

Btw if anyone wants to teach me some Tunisian phrases in the comments I’d love that :)",,,,,,2022-06-26 10:58:29

Turned it on again and the fan turned for ten seconds and stopped again.

so i'm studying something that is not computer science related, and i wanna build some programming skills that may help me to land job someday, like a plan B if i couldn't achieve what i want to achieve in the field that i chose to follow, one cant really rely on their creativity all the time especially mine. so that's why i wanna work on improving other skills in a different field, the thing is i'm not sure i can find a job without a computer science degree or even go abroad. i learned some programming languages such as C and i'm learning python, i also learned HTML/CSS and a little bit of js. i really like web development especially front-end, but i'm not sure what skills should i have to be able to land a job as a front-end developer, i really don't have an idea from where to go from here or whether i should keep doing this, it's really discouraging because as i said i don't study computer science in college.

the other thing is, now i'm financially unstable, and i don't wanna get a crappy job takes most of my time when i need to work on my skills and invest in myself while im still young, i wanted to work an English tutor, but i can't find people to teach, although i heard there are some online platforms where you can teach people English and you get paid somehow, i checked some but they requested a degree, or a certificate in English, and i don't have nor can i afford to take the IELTS test.

anyways i'm really stuck and don't wanna end up a pathetic loser, moan and blame the system. so like i'm trying to find ways to help myself so i don't end up that way in the future.

my questions are :

after learning html/css and js what should i do in order to become a front-end web developer?

can i find a remote job after one year of self-learning?

how can i find a job online as an English tutor that doesn't require a certificate?

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR: Tunisianet is falsely advertising products + removing standardized extras that are available in other countries (including 3rd world countries like ours)**

&amp;#x200B;

It's a bit of a shame that I have to write this. Been buying from Tunisianet for over 5 years. But the last year I started noticing a downgrade.

I'm not talking about the workers there. They're always overworked so I have no beef with them. They're also really patient so I value their effort.

My problem is with the products advertised on the website (which still, like most Tunisian websites, offers no option to turn off most of the tracking.)

95% of the time, the product is as advertised elsewhere. But when it comes to electronics, pay extra attention and do your research.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are two separate case studies:

&amp;#x200B;

**First case study:**

I needed a laptop a while ago. I did a thorough research on the model, including the extra parts it comes with as standard (such as a sata connector for sata SSD's).

&amp;#x200B;

I also cross-referenced different reviews from different countries (went as far to watch reviews in languages I didn't understand. But I know hardware pretty well so I can get the gist of it).

&amp;#x200B;

So I went there to finalize the purchase. Informed them in advance that I will return it if it lacks the accessories it comes with as standard. 

I opened the laptop box and did not find any of the accessories it should come with. This is a huge deal breaker because it meant I had to shell out over 1K DT for an equivalent simply because they didn't have a sata connector (I already own a Crucial MX 2TB Sata SSD).

&amp;#x200B;

To their credit, they did accept the return (always keep the guarantee paper). This is one of the advantages of buying from them. Still, did not expect them to remove standardized extras.

&amp;#x200B;

**Second case study:**

The old man needed a new TV receiver. Did a thorough research as always. But this time, my research led me to far more egregious findings. They were falsely advertising, seemingly with impunity.

&amp;#x200B;

The product in question is a Vision-Edge 4k receiver. But the picture has nothing to do with the product itself. It was most likely a knockoff. How did I know this?

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the image from the [official website](https://vision-ma.com/fr/recepteurs/2-vision-rec-edge-4k.html):  


https://preview.redd.it/xkwu1i8x0l891.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88826d60068abbe97d8ebdb9674261d67b25682e

Now here is the one from [Tunisianet](https://www.tunisianet.com.tn/recepteur/45759-recepteur-box-android-vision-edge-uhd-4k-avec-15-mois-iptv-volta-tv-15-mois-sharing-forever.html):

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m04vew1b1l891.png?width=666&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3960e1b63b7748d4c59c90e577aa4780b49731f9

&amp;#x200B;

Now you might think it was an updated/outdated model. So did I.

I checked all the models on the official website. Nothing came even close. So I went back to check a variety of reviews online of different receivers. Yay, fun.

&amp;#x200B;

I found a deluge of receivers with the same hardware as the second image (red receiver) but with different names imprinted on them (Samsat....).

&amp;#x200B;

Tunisianet, get your $hit together.

First of all: Congrats to everyone who got their bac, good luck to those still taking their resits, and better luck next time for those who didn't get it this year, to each their pace.

Now, I know that in Tunisia, the general rule is ""study all year long for bac, and then think about orientation, since it will depend on your bac grade"", and orientation posts have been flowing (no problem in that, you should definitely ask around before committing to a field). 

**However,** this rule isn't exactly applied around the rest of the world (at least, not fully). If your goal is to go abroad, the main rule to keep in mind is: **It's not a last minute project.** You cannot, by the end of june/beginning of july start wondering ""maybe I'll go to France, still unsure tho..."". 

The reasons are: 

* It's an administrative hell that you should be ready for months beforehand. 
* Universities abroad usually look at your grades of the last 2-3 years of high school, not just bac grades. So if you've been skipping classes, and having max 12 GPA and got a random 13-14 during bac...your file may not be at the top of the pile. 
* By july we are beyond the subscription deadlines of many universities. 

**Though,** some places have adapted to the Tunisian system and added a specific longer deadline for Tunisians and have a quota of foreign students, so if you can still luck out there, go for it. 

**Basically:** 

* **If you're still in high school:** start working on your grades (15-16 GPA maintained throughout high school), do side projects (associative work, personal work if you're into art or coding or writing..), work on your language skills (B2 is the minimum required at the bachelor/licence level in most countries), and search up the needed paperwork (do you need to sit for the SAT? Do you need to sit through an interview? How long will it take for the university to give you proof of subscription so that you can get your visa? What are the procedures for the bank? etc.) 
* **If you just got your bac:** you're going to need to rush through all of the above. If it works out, awesome, time to go find a place to live and start your new student life. But always stay updated on the administrative side of things. Yes you're technically allowed to study anywhere in the world: South Africa, Canada, Russia, but doing things last minute may make you lose opportunities.",,,,,,2022-06-30 10:10:04

Tunisians who haven't seen much of the world seem to believe up to today that we really are special and more intelligent than others. Funny actually. 

My friends and cousins ask me when I am home ""what do they (Europeans and Americans) say and think about us?"" and I am like ""hmm they don't think about us that much actually and many many of them don't know that we exist"". 

In Scandinavia there is something called ""jantelagen"" which basically is about the following: ""no matter how much you know or how highly you think of yourself or how intelligent you think you are or how much you achieve, YOU ARE NOTHING"". Now, that is a bit extreme but you get the point. 

In 2011, only a few months after releasing Levels which soon became an international hit, Swedish DJ Tim Bergling was asked by the TV reporter about his ""success"" so he answered ""no no I can't say I've succeeded of course, success is something bigger than this"" whereas Tunisian actor Jihed Cherni (you find the link down), after having played in a series or two which were watched by a couple hundred thousans in Tunisia, on a radio interview he said ""my success didn't come from nothing"".

Transportation was already a problem and now it's even worse especially for lower/middle class citizen who don't own a car, or (worse) old people who are disconnected from technology. Feels like taxis are collectively pressuring us to go through these apps and soon it will become a requirement.   

Most of the taxis now work without ""blayek"" and many times I have stopped taxis who shamelessly forced me to pay a bolt ride instead (can cost more than x2). 

I understand being a driver can be tough with all the traffic and the heat but at this point they're just exploiting the system since nobody is reacting and it's becoming a societal concern. It's not normal to pay 20dt for a simple ride (besides the obligatory mobile data), I can get a train ticket for this price.  

Anyway I wanted to know your thoughts on this, how often do you pay for these services and if you have any stories to share about this.",,,,,,2022-07-01 17:14:26

These are some notes I took while watching the Netflix documentary series.

“How To Become A Tyrant”

This is kais' favorite documentary

-Vision + VERY strong belief

-Outrage sells, show them that you understand their problem and their enemy is your enemy. Common grievance brings people together.

-Be a man of the people. Show your people that you are one of them.

-Brand your movement slogans, symbols, etc.

-Build your squad. Nobody governs alone…. People with diverse skillet: a trusty assistant, the organizer, ruthless military man and the war hero (in the doc they go into details explaining their roles)

-Choose the right time to strike and take over

-Crush your rivals, establish dominance every rival must be controlled and put to place.

-Be everywhere (secret police and trusty network of informants) and buy loyalty

-Put your people in charge 

-Everyone is EXPENDABLE, even family

-Conceal your brutality

-Choose a scapegoat

-Indoctrinate the youth

I advise you to watch the documentary series it’s very interesting.",,,,,,2022-07-03 19:46:16

vr3v87,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/vr3v87/tunisia_should_not_be_inspired_by_arabs/,28,Tunisia should not be inspired by Arabs,"Tunisia should not be socially, culturally or politically inspired by Arabs.

Every Arab country is a failure, except the ones with oil.

* Fear of minorities which turns into hatred.
* Refusal of making compromises. When they are strong, arabs say « I am strong. Why should I compromise ? » and when they are weak, arabs say « I am weak, how can I compromise ?! »
* Dialoguec can be seen as a sign of weakness. 
* Intense emotions at the expense of pragmatism
* Obsession about honor
* Toxic Masculinity. Sorry but it's true. Men must inherit twice as much as Women. If a family has a daughter, the money must go to her uncle. In Saudi Arabia, a female school burned down with girls inside instead of letting them leave, because they had no veil. In Egypt, a woman was sent to prison for criticizing harassment.
* Deep insecurity over humiliation.  It’s very hard in Arab culture to admit a mistake. Mistakes are associated with humiliation. It’s exceptional to hear  Arabs say *« We made a bad mistake. We apologize and will try to fix it »*
* Difficulty to think in nuances. (« They are partially right»). Thoughts are only expressed in extremes (« They are right » « They are wrong »). 
* Blind obedience to authorities figures. Fear of contradicting them. (« Professor,  I disagree with this idea »).

Every human is flawed but these characteristics are all arab cultural traits.

That is not to say Arab culture don't have qualities like Generosity toward strangers or courage on the battlefield. But I think in the case of Tunisia, the flaws outweight the benefits.",,,,,,2022-07-04 09:54:45

تنشر الموافقة على هذا الدستور على إثر إعلان الهيئة العليا المستقلة للإنتخابات بأن نتائج الإستفتاء أفضت الى موافقة الشعب بأغلبية الأصوات المصرح بها

الفصل 139 من دستور قيس سعيد :
يدخل الدستور حيز التطبيق إبتداء من تاريخ الإعلان النهائي عن نتيجة الاستفتاء من قبل الهيئة العليا المستقلة للإنتخابات.   

Saied deliberately removed the part where the ""yes"" vote is mentionned as a condition for the adoption of the new constitution.

This really means that Saied will adopt the new constitution no matter the result of the referendum, whether it is Yes or No. 

I brought up the problem of the chapter 139 here in the past, however, many people defended Saied saying that it is just a misunderstanding. But after seeing Belaid's draft, it became very clear that Saied intended the literal meaning of the chapter 139.",,,,,,2022-07-04 18:27:43

But now I know why. It was dangerous and stressful and you need to be an idiot to do it. Each day I was taking a risk by sharing the road with cars that can easily kill me if they get distracted or something goes wrong with their vehicle. 

I recently moved to a European city that is trying to make riding bikes safer and when that happens people start to use bikes to go everywhere. But as everywhere people tend to resist creating such infrastructure because of the initial cost and the car people complaining of less parking and road space. However, generally when these projects are implemented quickly everyone benefits even the car people:

* Less people take cars, so smoother circulation
* Better Air quality
* Less noise

I think that also in Tunisia we need some lobbying to get these projects started so people can see their benefits and people can start expecting them everywhere.  Basically is there such a group or organisation trying to promote biking infrastructure and more urban planning centred around it.",,,,,,2022-07-04 19:11:21

I can only imagine it's much ""worse"" on a larger scale.

anybody else noticed how many men in this country are openly misogynistic? you don't believe it ? take a look at social media, precisely facebook, any post that discuss women in Tunisia or marriage or jobs or trending videos made by women or even women's achievements in this country(which outnumber men's achievements anyway) and you'll almost always find bunch of dudes insulting and/or ridiculing women, and it's not like few of them it's most of them. which is something you rarely see in neighboring countries social media \[quite pathetic isn't it\].

Irl, I had ""friends"" that would start calling women ""97ab"" just because these women didn't reciprocate interest \[if you think you are one of these men please seek psychological help, you are  dysfunctional\]

I came to the conclusion that the rebel nature of Tunisian women is threatening to many men which makes them go really defensive and hateful towards women, since, apparently most of men in this shithole seek ""conservative"" women (basically want slaves in their houses and not an actual person to continue the rest of their lives with)

As a person that lived in a western country for a while, I know how valuable most Tunisian women are, \[other than the fact that they are gorgeous\] , they are exactly in the ""goldilocks zone"" when it comes to dating/marriage since they manage to be quite moderate( not the crazy liberal men-eating feminist nor the submissive useless woman), so cherish and appreciate them.

I failed this year's Bac exam and I want to try another year in my public school but I've few issues which are :

\- I repeated the previous year in Bac and also one year in 2nd grade secondary school and 7th grade middle school.

\- My total school year's mark of this year is below 10

\- I was expelled for few days

I tried getting my marks report both online and by going to school but I couldn't and I asked a school administrator about my situation but she was clueless and added that both the school principal and head administrator are taking a vacation so she also told me that I have to wait until August or even September therefore I'm currently unable to find out if I can repeat another year or not.

I searched online and I read somewhere that I've to be not over 22 (I will be 22 years old on 12/31) and got a total school year's mark no less than 10 so according to this I'm not able to repeat the year but I also read that school council can suggest to the ministry to let me repeat another year but then again I am a student who was expelled for few days (unfairly) and to make it worse, I also read that my situation needs to be handled before August or they won't let me do another year.

I cannot go to a private school because I cannot afford it and I want to specifically study in my school because it's the closest one that has Arts section and I cannot afford transportation to a far school so if I'm not able to do another year it'll also mean that I'm not able to do Bac at all.

Also, Since I'm unable to afford private school and transportation it means that I can't do vocational formation as an alternative to Bac since it's not free, I'm completely financially broke so my only hope in life is odd jobs and it honestly doesn't seem like a good choice.",,,,,,2022-07-07 21:39:02

أود أن أعرف ما إذا كان هناك أي تونسي يرغب في المساهمة في ذلك عن طريق إرسال نوع من الأوراق النقدية المحلية لي: جديدة ، قديمة ، عالية أو منخفضة القيمة ، لا يهم.

إذا كان لدى شخص ما ورقة نقدية يريدون إعطائها لي أو استبدالها أو بيعها ، فلا تتردد في إرسال رسالة إلي. أدرك أن الخدمة البريدية المحلية قد تصنف الأوراق النقدية على أنها عناصر محظورة ، ولكن إرسالها كجزء من خطاب قد يكون حلاً.

Need some advice on where to settle.,"I'll be moving back to Tunisia in about a year and a half. I'm looking into buying property but unfortunately I don't really know the country that well, the last time I lived there I was a child. I'm looking for specific qualities and I was hoping that you could help me narrow it down. I'm single and work remotely, so I'm prepared to move anywhere. 

I hope to find a place somewhere green, somewhat secluded (low population density), ideally not landlocked, with fast internet (essential to my job), an hour or so away from a major city.

Basically what I imagine is a countryside house on a secluded piece of land in a mountain/forest/coastal area where I have peace and privacy but can easily drive to a modern city for a night out, hopefully the kind of city where I can make new friends.

Do you know places that fit the profile, even partially?

The thing is Kais Said and I know this for a fact when he sacked the the judges one of them is a corrupt judge who only became a judge to get immunity as my family tried to prosecute him for violating the law when he was a the governor of ben arous (an immunity position to prosecution) and he even tried to get into the government after that but denied due to suspension for curruption. My entire family business which is a coffee shop open since 1975 just disappeared as if it didn't exist and all of it was a setup by him and a business man.
I am not saying I like Kais Said but as Tumisian youth we should take in charge of our future I don't likr that you need to be at least 35 to be able to be a member of parliment or at least 40 to be a president I think we should create the youth a political movement to ""youthify"" the political grounds I don't know how we can do that but I m so fed up of being represented by incompetent corrupt old dudes who constantly put their own benefit first.

I do really see a future with her and i intend to see it through but what if my parents have another say or they use (محناش راضيين عليك) and at one time they even accused her of being a @#$% because i came back late at eid's eve.
What do i do ?  Shit this is hard.",,,,,,2022-07-13 22:26:56

I've been scouring the posts these past couple of weeks and I've noticed a huge amount of posts about loneliness and people trying to find friends (mostly by teenagers) which is awesome TBH. But it's conserning.

I was surprised of the amount of posts and I wonder if it's only on Reddit or is it a societal phenomenon that's developping in the new generation. (I don't remember it being this bad when I was a teen).

I live in France and loneliness among youg people is a big issue here too. and Covid made things even wors by isolating everyone. 

Could any of you guys give some insights?

there's some awfully disrespectful customers who mess everything and leave / verbally abuse for prices you didn't obviously put 

we're all having daily goals in which is measured by n numbers so me and my coworkers always work under pressure and we sometimes fight of customers just so we can reach our daily goal,  


the attitude of managers is so disrespectful ( except only one ) , i mean what did i expected from girls who've been working there for more than 5 years and have nothing to do with their life except waiting for marriage and stay on the phone all day , we can't pull our phones in our shifts but they can and they come to work just to scroll mindlessly through socials and make stupid tiktoks ( they're in some shape or forme freret )   


I didn't like all of this and it's not about the money , it's true that i need the money especially that i'm renting a house alone and i have to cover all expenses ( thank god i don't smoke nor drink  cuz that shit's expensive ) but if i want to chase the money i'd stuck in that job 

so one day i was working and pathé called me , they said they need staff asap and they called me the first one because i left a really good impressions there , i told i need to at least finish my month so i can come but they said they can't wait anymore ( fuckin minions trend and thor ) and if i don't complete my month ill get a less paycheck and without the extra money ( we had a prime ) , so i shoot my shot and said fuck it , i went there and said that i want to quit , and since that moment everybody was basically harrasing me , and btw as soon as i said that , they started calling people for job interviews , so i quit and signed my quitting papers , i only took the pathé job offer because of my bad experience at indigo ( fuck indigo man ) and because i saw chances in pathé that could help me in the and the job overall is great for me , i know it's with a less pay but with every extra hour i work i get paid on it and they already told me that I'll start working extra hours , the base salary is 450 and it's decent for a three day a week work .  
 i just wanted to know your opinions about the decisions I make 

oh i also gave them some bipolar acts before i left xd ( said yesterday that i'm ready to work extra hours and can't wait formy promotion but as soon as i got the call i quitted immediately )",,,,,,2022-07-15 08:42:47

حسب وزير السياحة، جاونا عام 2019: 9 مليون سائح، أي 9 ملاين متمتع بمواد مدعمة أغلبها مستورد بالعملة الصعبة :

- فيليب ياكل الخبز المدعم المخدوم من الفارينة المستوردة بالدولار في وقت الفارينة سومها طالع في العالم جرة نقص العرض بحكم الحرب الروسية الاوكرانية
- يحوس بالمازوط المدعم اللي سومو في تونس من اقل الاسوام في العالم رغم اننا دولة غير نفطية
- الكليماتيزور بالكهرباء المدعمة اللي تتولد من الغاز المستورد بالدولار

هذا فيليب خلي عاد ميلود...

إذا علمت أن السياحة الكلها (مداخيل مباشرة و غير مباشرة) تساهم فقط ب 7% من الناتج القومي الخام (قرابة 3 مليار دولار) و أن كل ما تنتجه من ثروة بالكاد يغطي صندوق الدعم.

و إذا علمت أن الوتلة تخدم في ناس خدم هشة، ما تديكلاريش عليهم، برشة فلوس تقعد في الخارج، الكياس الي يوصل للوتيل مبني من فلوس دافع الضرائب، برشة إمتيازات..

التسعة ملاين سائح، يجيو في فصل الجفاف، في بلاد فيها فقر مائي والماء مقصوص في برشة بلايص، و سي السائح يدوش 3 مرات في النهار و يغطس في البيسين و يلعب ال golf و هذه أمور تستهلك الماء المفقود الي محرومة منه الفلاحة.

زيد على ذلك قطاع حساس جدا: فترة كوفيد التوريزم يتقطع والنزل تسكر وتطرد الخدامة.. خلي عاد في صورة عملية ارهابية لا يقدر كيما في صار في 2015 السياحة متاعك تموت حرفيا وماعاد يجيك حد واقعد قداش من عام باش تركح في امن البلاد وترجع الثيقة.

زيدهم ميزانية وزارة السياحة (باريس يزورها 60 مليون سائح و ما عندهمش وزارة سياحة).

كي تسمع 9 ملاين سائح، و تراهم يقضيو من ال monoprix دبوزة ماء و كعبات ياغرت و يركبوا في النقل المدعم، يمسخوا في الشاطئ و يمصوا في المائدة المائية.

إحسب، قداش خسرت البلاد من نقطة نمو، جراء هذا النموذج التنموي الفاشل في العشرين عام الإخرانيين.

موش وقيت نركزوا اكثر على قطاعات اخرى اكثر استقرار واستدامة فيها قيمة مضافة حقيقية؟

علاش الدولة ما تركزش اكثر في دعم الطاقات المتجددة. علاش ما نشريوش كميات كبيرة من les panneaux الشنوة -جودتهم باهية وسومهم معقول مقارنة بالالمان

عنا آلاف الاراضي ملوحة في الجنوب تلهب فيها الشمس نجمو نستغلوها ونعطيوها لشباب الجهة يعملوا مشاريع طاقة شمسية ويبيعوا للدولة الطاقة

نعملوا محطات طاقة شمسية ضخمة في الجنوب ويولي عنا فائض طاقي وترخص الكهرباء وتنقص تكلفة الإنتاج للسلع وبالتالي تنقص الاسوام.

فائض طاقي يوفرلنا الطاقة الضرورية باش نبنيو ونخدمو محطات جديدة لتحلية المياه ونحاربو الشح المائي وقصان الماء في الصيف ونوصلوه للجهات اللي مزالت من غير ماء في 2022

vzx4m0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/vzx4m0/tunisian_is_such_an_iteresting_language_but_how/,20,"Tunisian is such an iteresting language, but how could develop its writing system?","•To start, we have to know that Tunisian could be written in both Latin script and Arabic script. What i'm going to discuss the way tunisian is written in the Latin script since the arabic one is already canonized. You can call this ""a spelling reform"" where we speak about how tunisian words should be spelled. Spelling reform is not a new thing or rare. It was organized for multious languages before such as English, French, German, Spanish, Croatian, Italian...

The 9 most important points that i see should be adopted in writing Tunisian are:

1-Only long vowels are represented, short vowels would not: So baisically every short or reduced vowel shall not be spelled as long as it's not in the end of a word, for example:

Sidenote: The ː represent the long vowels 

Mchelk [mʃɛːlək] →Notice how [ɛː] is represented (by 'e') cuz it's a long vowel however the reduced sound [ə] was not not represented cuz it's reduced.

Djeja [dʒɛːʒæ] → Again the long vowel was represted, however the short vowel [æ] was represented as well because it was at the end.

But some will say ""So how would we distinguish long vowels in the inital or the middle place of a word, and the longs vowels in the end of a word"". Since only [uː] and [iː] are the only long vowels that could be in the end of a Tunisian word. Then 'u', 'i' would represent the long vowels in the initial and the middle of a word, and 'ou', 'y' would represt the same long vowels in the end of a word.

2-Definite nouns: If a word starts with a solar letter then we ought to doubling its first letter twice to make it definite and if it was a lunar letter then we add 'L' to the first, for example:

Tsswira (a picture) →Ttsswira (the picture)
7arf (a letter) → L7arf (the letter)

3-No diacritics, nor accents: Standard Tunisian would have no accents such as ""à, é, ï, û"". It would be just like English with no accents. Only lownwords like (Café - Nîme...) would still have accents. This point was suggested to make Tunisian much easier and simple.

4-Pharygealized consonants: so to not make it complicated pharygealized consonants are those who are pronounced back to the pharynx (a part in the food hole) which are in arabic ""ط"" [tˁ], ""ص"" [sˁ], ""ض/ظ"" [ðˁ]. So since phonetics says that pharygealized ane non-pharygealized equivalents are indeed pronounced in the same place for eachz we'll make it simple and represent each parygealized consonant twice the letters a non-pharygealized consonant would need, so simply:

Tt = ط [tˁ]  |  T = ت [t]
Ss = ص [sˁ]  |  S = س [s]
Tth = ض/ظ [ðˁ]  |  Th = ذ [ð]

So basically ""a pail"" would be ""Ssttl"" and ""the pail"" would be ""Sssttl"". ""a table"" would be ""Ttaula"" and the ""the table"" is ""Tttaula"". Some would say ""is it ususal to write 3 Ts in a row?"", but Welsh got 4 Ls btw as in ""Llanfair....drobwllllanty..."" So it's a normal linguistic appearance. Other would say ""Well but some words will completely have no vowels"" however it's so normal since a lot of the slavic languages never write their vowels such as ""Srpski"" and ""Strč prst skrz krk"". And no this writing way of Tunisian would nolonger be difficult if you gave it a shot and practises it as usual.

The same ""Th"" represents both ث and ذ just like English

5-""W"" would be only used if it's after a consonant. So words like ""طاولة، ناوي، يدواي"" would be ""Ttaula, Neui, Ydeui"" not ""Ttawla, Newi, Ydewi"". The reason behind this point is that many major languages treat ""w"" as a consonant not a vowel and so i considered that it's pretty logic to use it as a consonant.

6-Apostrophes are either used as definite isolater between the ""L"" and the vowel-starting word like ""L'anania"" (The egoism) - ""L'ist9tlel"" (the independance), or used as pronounciation isolated, for example: 
""sh"" (ش) - ""s'h"" (سهـ)/ ""tth"" (ض/ظ) - ""t'th"" (تذ)

7- The letter ""c"" would be used as [k] sound and i sound that this is a revival of the way 'c' is pronounced in African romance that lived for long in the provinve of Africa (Tunisia nowadays) but there will be some rules. 'C' would be only used before consonants and all consonants (a,e,o,u,i,y) just as in as usual-ish way so:
Crrasa - كراسة/Clit - كليت /Cnna - كنا/
Cassecroute - كسروت/ Ces - كاس/ Cteb - كتاب...

It's also so usual for languages to use 'c' as [k] always (Latin and Old English did it atleast).
Small info: You can use 'K' before ""e,i,y"" instead of 'C'

8-Loanwords in Tunisian that their pronounciations are being kida shifted shall be written the same way as in their original languages but pronounced as in Tunisian, that means you'll be writing ""Citerne"" but still pronouncing it as same you used to [sitirnæ]

9-The only accepted diphthongs/Triphthongs in this new writing system are ""Th"", ""Tth"" and ""Ch/Sh"". No others are allowed like ""Kh, Gh, Dh"" because they're phonologically incorrect, rather numbera will still be used as a way of representing the wanted sounds such as ""2,3,5,7,8,9"". Oh yeah and not other numbers are allowed to be used.

And those are the 9 most important notes to develop the latino-Tunisian script as it is so useful nowadays. And i think you liked them...",,,,,,2022-07-15 19:33:07

I always notice how badly everyone of them talks about Tunisia as if it is hell on earth. Just the other day, an old Tunisian guy, whom I had not asked for his opinion, told me how bad Tunisia supposedly is. He even devalued whole professional groups, according to him Tunisian doctors are nothing compared to European doctors and their diploma is worth nothing. After talking with him for a while I found out he himself lives like a dog, he survives from social fraud and moonlighting as a cleaner and has achieved nothing here even after 30 years. 

Guess how many here share his situation and are highly indebted, even those with good education. They only get the dirty jobs, are exposed to constant humiliation and have sold themselves and their dignity just to show off 1 time a year with an expensive rental car in their home country in front of everyone and thus create false illusions.

This first generation of immigrants children were allowed to grow up in socially deprived areas and had to go through a bitter childhood marked by identity crises, humiliation, discrimination, devaluation of their own origins. Its actually an insult for many native children to call them or someone 
Tunisian, Moroccan or Turkish. 

Until today, every generation goes through a process of assimilation attempts on the part of society on the one hand and the desperate attempt of the parents to convey the traditions and culture on the other hand, many schizophrenic personalities emerged.
These poor souls have developed their own culture, which is neither here nor in their homeland contemporary and took only the worst of both cultures. 

They have reinterpreted Islam and are quick to forgive themselves, but very strict with others. Fasting is voluntary, praying only a workout suggestion done once a week on a Friday and interest is allowed. Drunk and wasted after their third glass of vodka they’ll happily explain to you how someone somewhere in Saudi Arabia once said something that somehow it would be allowed after all. Haram meat is allowed because living in the West is a particularly difficult hurdle and you would unfortunately have no choice despite the 1000 alternatives. However, woe betide you if you get caught with a pork salami, all hell breaks loose here.
I don’t care if you’re religious or not, or what ever you believe, but this kind of stuff… just lol. 

Btw, we weren’t welcome, we are still not welcome and we will never be, even after all this time and all that our parents had to put up with and go through. Children of the 3rd and 4th generation are still not accepted as native. We learnt to live with that and move on. 

Unfortunately, all the cake is gone. Even before the current economic crisis, a large proportion of people in European countries are barely able to save money and will be affected by severe poverty by the time they reach retirement age at the latest. At the same time, they pay far too high taxes, which are squandered or embezzled for the stupidest things. It is true that consumption is quite cheap here, but assets in any form are damn expensive. You can buy many consumer goods here relatively cheap on an average salary, but you will never own anything important that could accumulate wealth. Real estate is unaffordable even for two academics working full time, your only chance would be to have parents that could pay half of the costs for you and even then you would be in debt for at least the next 25 years. 

Why do so many still believe that this is the promised land? 
Newly immigrated North Africans are at the bottom of the food chain and most of them are just waiting to be deported. During their stay here, however, they go to great lengths to disgrace themselves and their compatriots. So where does this subservience from all sides to Europe come from?

Don't these people realize how ridiculous they sound? How many still want to sell their values and standards in the hope of finally being accepted by their colonial master? Do these people really think that they are seen as equals? That they are something better? We are perhaps half a crisis away from Europe going after refugees and people who look like us. 

Many things are indeed better here, like free health care and social security (although for how long will this go on well?) but that is only due to the (unfairly distributed) wealth that countries like France had grabbed from the raw materials of Africa through exploitation and robbery and still benefit from it until today.

And as I said, it's not about condemning desperate people who want to flee despite the dangers of drowning in the sea und such. 
It’s about self hating bootlickers who have achieved nothing in either country, but have decided to boost their self-esteem by badmouthing their homeland and their countrymen.



PS: yes, my plan is to come back and live in Tunisia (or Morocco) in the next 5 years and I invested a lot of money already, so it’s not just all smoke and mirrors.

So to introduce myself, I am an Algerian who hasn't visited Tunisia since long time ago, and since the border are opening up again, I am planning to visit Tunisia this days. I've always had a good image of Tunisians, being welcoming, cultivated and good living people.

Lately browsing social media mainly Facebook and Instagram, I stumbled upon lot of posts and videos from Tunisians expressing an obvious hatred toward Algerians tourists, hatred ranging from calling to rise the prices on us to literally inciting violence and asking us to not come to Tunisia.

Now of course I know from experience in my own country that social media never reflect the general opinion and it tend to promote the extreme opinions since such opinions is what brings more clicks and engagement, but what's bothering me is that it seems like there are lot of people who have this opinion in Tunisia, and its becoming kind of trend.

So I would like to take the opinion from reddit since people here tend to be more reasonable and have rational points of view.

PS: I am in no case stating that Algerian tourists are angels and that they dont abuse their presence in other countries, but that doesn't justify the trend I am seeing.

So my aim is to include those weird or lewd topics, the songwriting genre I have in mind for those songs is mostly 60s pop, like The Kinks. Beck is another influence. These songs for the most part won't be very serious sounding, it's kind of like social commentary but at the same time taking the piss. With that said, if you guys have any ideas I'd love to hear them. I write a lot.",,,,,,2022-07-17 13:28:25

I've been looking into purchasing a laptop for intensive graphical work (3D, rendering) and also good CPU performances, preferably with similar specs to these : 

\-RTX 3070 8GB mainly (RTX 3060 if the performance is less than 20% loss)  
\-MUX Switch preferably

\-i7 11th or 12th generation or equivalent in Ryzen (ryzen 5 or 7) since there isn't an important difference  
\-Optionally 2K and good refresh rate above 144Hz, FULLHD is good as well   


The models I've found so far after a couple of weeks of research and benchmark comparison :  
\-Legion 5 pro

\-Aorus 5 SE4  
\- Asus Rog Strix G15 (2022)  
\-Zephyrus M16 (might require a higher budget)

Anyone want to meet up and chat?,"(Sorry mods if this type of post is not allowed). Hi, I’m an American guy in my 20s staying in Tunis for a couple days with another American friend. I’ve spent some time in Morocco before and I’m a big fan of the people and culture of the Maghreb, so I’ve been wanting to visit Tunisia for a long time. I’d like to meet up with any young people who are free and just chat about life for a bit. Drinks (coffee, tea, juice, beer, wine, whatever) are on me. I also speak French pretty well and would love to practice, or you can practice your English. Leave a comment or DM me if you’re interested and maybe we can hang out. Thanks!

Edit: I’m staying near Place de la Kasbah in Tunis, but it’s possible I may end up in another city and I’m happy to visit other neighborhoods of Tunis. Wednesday, Thursday or Friday are the best days. And I just offered to cover the drinks as a friendly gesture, but if you want to pay for your own or even mine that is fine by me as well!",,,,,,2022-07-19 16:30:21

My boyfriend is currently abroad and this job will allow him to come back home and be with me once again. He's having a hard time at the country he is at.

My best friend recently lost her job and is currently on the search for a new job. She does not have an income at the moment.

There is an opening that each of them can fill. If I refer my bf, he will certainly get the job and if I refer my best friend, she will certainly get the job. However, if I refer them both, my bf is most likely to have the job. 

What should I do ? Who should I refer? Should I refer them both and wait?

I think my best friend is more in need for the job, but also, my bf will know I referred her and not him and it will be a bad situation.. I cant say that I dont want him to get this job and come back too because I do..

CLARIFICATION:

This is a fully remote position and the work environment is perfectly healthy.

UPDATE: 

I just spoke with my bf, told him that there is an opening and that I will refer both of them. He told me he would pass and I should refer my best friend because she is more in need for a job and he will do his best to find another job allowing him to come back 🥺💔

[Geography Now](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmmPgObSUPw1HL2lq6H4ffA) (\~3m subscribers), likely the BIGGEST Geography channel on YouTube, is working on the Tunisia episode (they make an episode on every country, going by alphabetical order). As the channel has grown they've been putting more and more effort into the videos making them longer and more detailed. aH we are so far down the alphabet LOL.

Anyways, this will most likely be the **BIGGEST video on Tunisia in ALL of YouTube.** Lets make a big impression! He loves asking the people of the country to directly contribute to his videos, answering questions for each of his segments. I have emailed him already, and sent me the questions/information he would like to know about our country! I will paste what he has asked in the email in this post at the bottom. You can either reply to this post (I will try my best to compile and send him an email back) or you can directly email him at **the email in the reply to this post**. I am pretty busy nowadays, so don't trust me on taking all of your suggestions, I will do the best I can. I'd prefer if you could email him your answers directly! Here is the email:

&gt;Hey Malek again!   
So basically I'm asking all my Tunisian Subscribers a bunch of questions and if you'd like to help feel free to answer any (or all) of these questions!  
ALSO If you are interested in recording yourself for any special segment in the show (Like the famous places, food, language, culture or other stuff let me know and I'll write a segment for you in the video!)    
What are some secret cool places to see in Tunisia that not many people know about?  
2. FOODS - Top foods that are DISTINCTLY Tunisian. Like you can only find them in Tunisia- What are they?  
3. What is a ""Tunisian?"" Like if the Arab world was a family, how would Tunisia fit in? What is their ""role"" or what are they ""known"" for? What do they specialize in?  
4. Tunisian dialect- I've been told Tunisian Arabic is pretty unique and has a mixture of many different influences. Can you explain a little bit more about Standard Arabic vs. Tunisian Arabic? (I am also looking for Volunteers to record themselves explaining more on this! Would you be interested?)  
5. What are some of the economic specialties of Tunisia? What drives your country and what are you ""good"" at?  
6. What are some of the controversies Tunisia is facing today ?  
7. SPORTS! - What should Art say in the Sports segment in the episode? What are some Sports highlights of Tunisia?  
8. HANNAH'S CULTURE SEGMENT! - What is DISTINCTLY Tunisian Culture? What are Tunisians known for with customs, traditions, practices, beliefs, lifestyles, folklore, ...etc. What makes Tunisian special and unique from all other Arabs/ Maghrebi people?  
9. KEITH'S MUSIC SEGMENT- What are some of the top things people should know about Tunisian Music? Are there any distinct styles, genres, instruments, or themes that are ONLY done in Tunisia? Or Dances? And who are some of the most famous Tunisian Musical Artists? (Modern and historical)  
10. LAST CHANCE- what are some things you think I absolutely CANNOT miss in the episode? Things you want the whole world to know about Tunisia? Are there any weird/ interesting facts nobody knows? What do you think? Let me know!  
\-Barbs

I have already typed out my response to the first part which is usually cool geography, and focused a lot on the northwest (wilayat jendouba, beja, bizerte, kef) in where Tabarka and Ain Draham are really underrated beauties in the whole of North Africa They actually are one of the fastest growing tourism areas of tounes. In fact, Tabarka has the most rainfall of any coastal city in the Levant or North Africa, and Ain Draham the most rainfall in general! We are blessed to have these two exclaves of rain and dense forest in our country (in fact the vast majority of the Mejerdah's flow comes from the Kroumirie). It is not typically North African, and is a small part leftover from the African humid period thousands of years ago. I want him to mention these, as people only think desert when they think of Tunisian geography (in a large part bc of Star Wars).

**Anyways, please help and contribute as much as you can! This will likely be our MOST VIEWED, and honestly, INFLUENTIAL video on YouTube!!**

Then, she started staring at the boys around us and smiling and making small talkings or saying bad words out loud so they can notice her. One of them was clearly minding his own business but she said that he's looking at her, she went to swim next to him even talked to him but he was avoiding her which made her upset, she even asked me if her boobs are clear enough and other questions about her being sexually attractive. I tried to keep her away, advicing her without sounding like a mom, but I eventually got out and left her trying to get the boy's attention

My problem is, if one of them just gave her the attention she was craving for, or just seized the chance, would it be ""taking advantage of her""? would it be his fault or her fault? she was 17, her 18th birthday could be tomorroww and she'll be legally free to make her decisions but it felt so wrong, I felt that she was so young to think that way! I felt confused because while she's 17 I'd say it was the boy's fault but when she'd be 18 (which could be after one day), it'll be hers because she was kinda ""asking for it"" .

we should always support the victim but should we have ""biased standards""?I always think that life is not ""either white or black"" but our standards should be, is that wrong?

""Photos of women in full Islamic attire - faces covered and in long dresses - next to old pictures of women in short skirts from the 1950s and 1960s in North Africa and the Middle East are often put together on social media to make a point.

The underlying message is: ""Look what has become of Arab societies during the past 50 years or so.""

To those who share such photos, it is the most visible sign of how their countries have regressed and abandoned the ideals of progress and modernity, exemplified by adopting a Western lifestyle.

But for the conservative forces that have shaped the region in the past few decades, it is quite the opposite: it is a positive act of asserting Muslim identity in societies that had for long been colonised and had a Western lifestyle imposed upon them first by colonial rulers, and then by Westernised elites out of touch with local culture.

From Morocco to Egypt and beyond, the issue of ""Islamic dress code"", in particular the veil or hijab, has been one of the most controversial piece of clothing.

By all accounts, its spread within the region has been down primarily to one factor: the emergence and eventual success of political Islam, the phenomenon also known as Islamism.

The whole of North Africa has powerful Islamist movements that either came to power or nearly did as in the case of Algeria in the early 1990s.

Even after they were removed from power, their influence over societies has remained considerable.

But that is beginning to change, according to many observers. And one of the most obvious ways to assess that is by looking at the most potent symbol of the impact of Islamism: the hijab.

Many observers have noted that the past few years have seen a steady decline in the phenomenon in North Africa.

In Moroccan news website Al-Yaoum 24, columnist Said El-Zaghouti recently wrote: ""It's not hard to notice that the extent to which the hijab was worn in our Arab world, and in particular in Morocco, has gone down relatively, and that retreat and decline is to a large extent due to the decline and ebb of what is known as the Islamic current.""

Young Moroccan women have spoken to local media about the social pressure, even harassment, they have to endure when they take off the hijab. But that has apparently not deterred them.

In Tunisia, where wearing the hijab was once an act of defiance because it was banned by successive autocratic regimes, it became popular for a brief period following the 2011 Arab Spring, but has started to fall off again recently.

Writing in the Arabic Independent, Tunisian journalist Huda Al-Trabulis highlights the complex motives for the appearance of the hijab in the country and its subsequent decline.

The hijab was once an act of resistance and opposition to secularism imposed from above during the rule of the post-independence autocrats, Habib Bourguiba and Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali.

It then became popular in the short period after the revolution in 2011 that saw the rise to power of the Islamist Ennahda movement, to the extent that the veiled woman was promoted as the model to follow for the Tunisian public.

But then it fell out of favour as successive Islamist-dominated parliaments failed to solve the country's many problems and Tunisia plunged into a deep economic and political crisis.

In Egypt too, arguably the birthplace of the hijab as we know it today, the appearance and relative decline is tied up with the political fortunes of the Muslim Brotherhood.

Egyptian women began throwing off traditional face coverings nearly a century ago and by the mid-twentieth century the veil had almost completely disappeared.

But the hijab made its first re-emergence in the mid-seventies when then-President Anwar Sadat gave a green light to the Muslim Brotherhood to operate on university campuses to fight off political rivals from the secular left who had developed considerable influence over society in the previous decades.

The spread of the hijab continued almost unabated until 2013 when the Muslim Brotherhood President Mohammed Morsi was removed from power.

Hostility to Islamist symbols - the hijab foremost amongst them - was palpable.

There were persistent reports of restaurants denying access to women wearing the hijab, or swimming pools refusing entry to women wearing the burkini, the supposedly Sharia-compliant swimsuit.

Today there is palpable decline that is hard to quantify due to a lack of objective surveys. The evidence is largely anecdotal.

Still, the hijab remains one of the country most divisive issues - a cultural and political fault-line not dissimilar to the one surrounding abortion in the US, with cultural and political rows breaking out at regular intervals on the matter.
Most recently in Egypt reactions to the stabbing to death of a young university student in broad daylight by her suitor after she refused to marry him were as shocking as the crime itself.

To everyone the crime was abhorrent and duly condemned. But as soon as it emerged that the victim was unveiled, reactions began to diversify.

A famous tele-preacher urged women to cover their bodies properly to avoid meeting a similar fate. He actually said: ""Cover your face with a basket.""

And when her university sought to pay tribute to her, it produced a poster of her with her photo apparently doctored so it appeared as though she was wearing the hijab.

Both reactions triggered a barrage of angry responses from the secularised sectors of society.

The young man has been sentenced to death by hanging. But a campaign has swung into action to defend the convicted murderer.

No-one knows for sure who is behind it, but many suspect wealthy Islamists in exile have hired the highest paid lawyer in the country to defend the culprit in the appeal proceedings.

An intervention by al-Azhar - the highest religious institution in Egypt - to calm tension has ironically poured more oil on the fire.

The Grand Imam of al-Azhar, Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayeb, has said that not wearing the hijab does not make the woman a renegade, but simply a woman who disobeyed God.

The statement that was meant to assuage secular sectors of society enraged women's rights and other secular groups even more.

Once again, social media were full of impassioned pleas for the hijab as an inalienable part of the faith and equally vociferous condemnation of the cloth.

Although support for the hijab appear to be waning in the region, especially among the young, the perception that it is inseparable from Muslim identity has become entrenched far and wide.

So much so that whenever any government - especially in Europe - introduces restrictions on wearing it in public institutions, that is usually denounced as a war on Islam itself.

Merely criticising the hijab in Western democracies has also become almost synonymous with ""Islamophobia"" or attacks on minority rights.

But in Muslim-majority societies it is still regarded as part of a legitimate campaign for the liberation of women from stifling tradition.""",,,,,,2022-07-21 19:57:19

Many people still think Kaisoun (the president) cares about democracy or the state of the law the way the other parties look at it. 

Kaisoun has chosen a very clear way, similar similar that of El Sisi in Egypt, Recep in Turkey and Vladimir in Russia, and has been working professionally and silently on his plans. 

I honestly don't think he has any plans of going back to the type of the democracy we have been seeing in the last decade as long as he is alive. 

The same way Ben Ali had a parliament, Kaisoun will also have a parliament, but it will be primarily composed of marionettes just the way Ben Ali had it. It is quite funny that there are still people who are waiting for the results of the referendum and don't seem to have yet understood the intentions of the president.


Until then he will keep fighting against them because of course establishing a dictatorship is not an easy thing and he will take his time just as Ben Ali took his time.

You might be wondering ""but what about democracy and institutions, and what if Kais suddenly dies?"" In that case I can tell you the easy answer: Kais is not responsible for what happens after him. He has a goal and a plan and a mission, the day he goes away his mission is finished and new people can re-start from scratch and do whatever they want.",,,,,,2022-07-22 13:13:29

I just visited your country for the first time and i absolutely adored it; the people, the culture, the landscape, everything.  We had a fantastic time and I hope to return again before long. 

I had a quick question for Tunisian redditors; at Tunis Airport we were unable to spend our remaining Dinars. Merchants accepted Euros , USD, Swiss Francs etc, but no Dinars. Also, no forex to exchange dinars beyond passport control. It's a minor complaint but it seems strange that the local currency should be refused as legal tender.

I won't talk about why I would vote ""no"", this is not the subject. I want you to please vote ""yes"" if you're convinced, as long as it's a fair election where all Tunisians can be represented.

My question is how can I go and vote ""no"" in this referendum and trust its result?

This president launched an online referendum (istichara) and asked Tunisians whether they wanted a new constitution. This istichara had 200k (less than 2%) participate for more than a month and mysteriously went up to 500k in 1-2 days. 500k is 4.2% of Tunisians and 5.5% of eligible voters. Did Saied admit that this istichara was inconclusive based on participation? No it was considered a success. So what is going to stop him from doing whatever he wants based on participation in the elections? Nothing, he showed he will do what he wants.

The online referendum with huge selection bias (his own supporters are the majority of responders) which is a basic statistical flaw... no let's ignore that. Let's say his istichara represented what the people wanted. People (who are mostly his supporters) said they didn't want a new constitution but rather changes to the current constitution. So if the istichara is a success, and Saied will take into account people's choice then he won't attempt to change the constitution? NO he wanted to write his own constitution regardless of what people said in the online referendum that he considered a success. So let me ask you, is this a person who will accept the result of the referendum this weekend? he already did what he wanted with the previous one. What makes you think this will change anything?

Okay okay but Saied is knowledgable and will only listen to experts not istichara.. he intentionally started a national dialogue that he knew he will just throw away and do what his plan was. He's been doing this for years. So he doesn't listen to any experts either, and he's certainly not an expert himself when he writes a constitution full of glaring legal flaws.

Saied won't rig the elections though, that's crazy! Is it though? it's the same guy who refused to listen to the istichara telling him not to change the constitution. It's also the same guy who for the first time since 2010 assigned ISIE himself with his own loyalists and all sorts of organizations are saying they're messing with voter registration and have not been transparent. It's the same guy who intentionally banned international observers and of course ISIE is his own people now so who exactly is observing these elections? ISIE previously refused to automatically register voters because everyone knows records are not accurate and the old regimes used that to fake votes. Why would Saied, the same guy who refuses to accept referendum results and assigns his own people, why would he do that? Just coincidence?

If this is a guy that will respect the laws or the election laws or their results, how can he be the only one not abiding by those laws and using the Tunisian flag in sponsored expensive ads in illegal advertisement spaces (malls and all that, not dedicated areas by municipalities)? Why wasn't that punished but the ""no"" campaign is punished for doing legal things like campaigning in region like Sidi Bouzid (Afek Tounes was assaulted)? Why was there intentional and direct orders to assault protesters and opposers of the constitution if this is a real referendum?

This is one of the very last times I'll be able to say all of this without being terrified of being put in jail since this regime will be just like the previous one eventually and the walls will have ears soon (Tunisians who lived under Ben Ali know about ""l7yout tesma3"") so I will say this: I will not vote to this regime. No and Yes is a vote for the regime because this regime showed that it doesn't matter what you vote. They also showed that they're embarrassed by participation in estichara and had to spend Tunisians money promoting it to death to get it to 500k (if we're being innocent and pretending it doubled in 2 days). The best you can do as someone who doesn't believe in this regime in my opinion is to not vote. The voting bureaus will be empty and it's a clear failure even if the constitution passes and it will regardless of what you will vote. If you vote, the voting bureaus will be full and mr Kais will choose the result he wants and say you participated in it.

This is my opinion as a Tunisian and it looks like it's forbidden almost everywhere so I wanted to write it here. Again, please go and vote ""yes"" if you want. you're a Tunisian and I won't argue with your choice. **I want the chance to choose too**",,,,,,2022-07-23 08:58:46

I am putting together a playlist/CD and I'm planning to include one song from every country (UN member) in the world. I'm here today to ask for some suggestions of music from Tunisia.

For each country, I am looking for a song in the country's most prevalent non-English official language. So in this case, I would be looking for a song in **Arabic** (Standard or Tunisian).

As I also want the playlist to be full of songs that I actually enjoy, I'd like to ask for suggestions of songs that are more high-energy, preferably from the relatively modern music scene. It doesn't have to be hardcore dubstep or anything, but I just prefer songs with faster tempos and a good beat that you can bop your head along with.

**Please note, I have a lot of countries to go through and so not a whole lot of time. Please only recommend *one or two songs*, and don't recommend an entire album or an artist's entire works. Just pick a really good one.**

I look forward to hearing from you!",,,,,,2022-07-24 03:19:28

Hopefully, I am getting married soon. I always had a disdain for most people in general ( including family). After negotiations with my mother, I have successfully managed to shrink the number of guests to a more or less satisfactory number. However, with my introvert dominated personality and my general hostility to Tunisian wedding traditions, I keep worrying that I might lose my temper and snap at these leeches who will be staying with us for the duration of the wedding and acting as if the house was theirs. Any advice please on how I can work on myself ( basically to avoid "" nitarch9 3lihom wa7id wa7id"" ) just for the few days of what should be my fucking wedding and not others.

That argument however is so weak or even non-existent in reality. I mean, no matter whether people vote yer or no tomorrow, the pice of coffee will be the same on Tuesday. And your family problems will not disappear. And the bus will come in the same time. And Uncle Ali's shop will open and close at the same time. Nothing, absolutely nothing will change. 

Perhaps in the very long term some things will change but in the short term politicians are definitely not affecting the loves of the masses. They may make special laws which benefit special (usually very few) people in the short term and change their lives dramatically but that is never the case with the constitution anyway, instead that is something usually done in the parliament. 

That is why for example some political parties are for privatising the public sector,  because they might become suddenly millionaires out of it, but the masses will always have the same miserable lives. Pathetic and sad that not all people can see very clearly this very clear truth.",,,,,,2022-07-24 13:18:25

- option 1: complete a master degree in France then landing a job there, but I don't want to waste another year in education.

- option 2: work for one year here and learn German at the same time to get a job offer there , honestly i don't know if this is guaranteed,  if there is someone here who did this before tell me.

- option 3: learn programming in the field of machine learning AI or web development for one year, especially that i have a good previous experience with programming during my two years in prepa.

&gt; تونس جزء من الأمة الإسلاميّة، وعلى الدّولة وحدها أن تعمل على تحقيق مقاصد الاسلام الحنيف في الحفاظ على النّفس والعرض، والمال، والدّين والحريّة.

ما يخفاكمش انو طبعا مقاصد الاسلام يقصد بيها مقاصد الشريعة ([كيما قالها الرئيس في المطار](https://youtu.be/R_zEvlnJ6nY&amp;t=2m38s)). مقاصد الشريعة الاسلامية هو [كتاب للشيخ محمد الطاهر بن عاشور](https://www.noor-book.com/%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D9%85%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B5%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B9%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%87%D8%B1-%D8%A8%D9%86-%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%B4%D9%88%D8%B1-pdf).

بن عاشور، اللي يقولوا عليه وقتها تنويري، هو نفسو قام **بتكفير الطاهر الحداد المدافع عن حقوق المرأة في تونس**.. مع العلم انو التكفير مدعاة للقتل ضد كل مَن يصدر في شأنه حكم بالكفر والردة.

بن عاشور نفسو كان متمسك **بالخلافة** ويؤيد الجلد وقطع يد السارق **ويرفض حرية المعتقد**، متمسك بتعدد الزوجات، ويقول **بقتل المرتدد**..

هل مستعدين نحطو فكر بن عاشور ومقاصد الشريعة في الدستور اعلى نص في البلاد؟

ما تخافوش كيفاش سيتم تطبيق مقاصد الشريعة؟ كيفاش سيتم **تطبيق الحفاظ على العرض** (العرض عند العرب=النساء)؟ هل وفق تعاليم بن عاشور الارثودوكسية اللي كفرت الحداد واللي تدعو لدولة الخلافة؟

كيفاش سيتم تطبيق الحفاظ على الدين؟ هل سيتم تكفير كل من له رأي مخالف (كيما صار للحداد)؟ هل باش نطبقوا حد الردة على مئات التوانسة اللس خرجوا من الاسلام؟ هل باش نعاقبوا اللي يفطر في رمضان واللي ما يصليش بحكم الحفاظ على الدين؟

علاش تم حذف مفهوم الدولة المدنية من الدستور الجديد وتعويضها بمقاصد الشريعة؟

Kais Said is going to either save us or make it 70/80% of getting into lebanon scenario.,"Lebanon’s foreign currency reserves around 3bn dollars. Tunisia increased this year to 8bn dollars. Keeps the Tunisian state going in case all should be spend on expenses for 5 months approximately.
Lebanon’s annual national budget deficit is 20%, we just reached 10%. 

So we’re already halfway down to becoming like Lebanon an utterly  failed state. The next 3/5/7 years are crucial, will they turn the tide (sort of) or make the Tunisian state financially collapse? 

Just an example; Morocco foreign currency reserves are 30bn dollars and annual state budget deficit round 5%.
Egypte foreign currency reserves at 25bn dollars.

By the end of this week when the constitution is adopted FULL focus and priority should be on the economy and highly needed reforms. Time is really running out.",,,,,,2022-07-25 11:43:15

- There's no threshold (aka a minimum of voters needed) and so boycotting is just enforcing the YES over the NO (assuming you're against it)

- If your concern that the president can alter the results, I believe he can also alter the number of participants, right? 

- If you don't give a tiny shit about the vote then this question is not for you. I understand the frustration and I also believe that while voting is a right, people still have the choice to boycott. I'm mainly asking people that call for boycott to defeat KS

I have lived 20 years in Canada/QC and came back to Tunisia around 2008, lived a few years under Ben Ali and as a normal citizen I did not have any issues besides not talking politics when having a coffee with friends.

There were not strikes every few days, I felt safer when going out late at night, I could afford a car / going out. National companies were more efficient and better thant they are now.The Dinar was not shit like its now. 

Its true that Ben Ali was no saint, but for an average citizen, you cannot deny that life was better. From personal experience, Tunisians always know everything about everything and will argue things to death, same goes for our politicians and parliament. What I think Tunisia needs is a strong leader, to stop all the quarreling between parties and actually get things done.

I dont know Kais, I dont worship him but one thing is clear is he is trying to go forward and is not a thief ( atleast from the looks of it ) . Are we going to fail or succeed , only time will tell, but a change was needed.

So, I am asking genuinely what did you  gain from the Arab Spring and democracy?one thing is clear, that democracy does not put food on the table.",,,,,,2022-07-25 23:20:47

Here is my prognosis (sorry for the bleak picture):
A puppet Parliament will be elected, Saied of course will make sure the future members are under his control. A puppet government will be appointed (by Saied of course). The state will be run by an incompetent bunch with no skills whatsoever to manage a country. Saied will carry on with his primitive philosophy ""El bina2 al 9a3idy"". The state will turn into a new ""Jamahiriya"". In the meantime, our economic woes will deepen. No real  solutions will be implemented, because they are all unpopular (restructuring Public companies aka privatisation, phasing off the subsidy system...), people will turn against Saied if he attempts to force them, something he will never do. Saied will continue to isolate himself and the country internationally. No lender in their right of mind will continue to lend us money. Eventually, the music will stop, the state will go bankrupt and fail. People will suffer.

Following the results of this referendum , I can see there’s already a divide amongst us all. I write this message in hopes of it resonating and spreading amongst many of you. 

Regardless of what the outcome is, we have reached a critical stage in this country’s history. We only need to look around us to understand the state of the Arab World (Lebanon, Libya, Algeria, Syria, Jordan, etc). We do not want to follow them in their demise. Yet we are so close to reaching that point regardless of this referendum.

I know to many of the results of this referendum are highly polarising and controversial. Whether you voted or not, who you voted for, your class, your education, your colour, your gender, your religion or any characteristic that differentiates us from one another, let us be better to one another. I believe we can universally agree one of the many consequences of our  revolution was the divisions it created among us. In every social class we are split, arguing, marginlaising, and separating ourselves from each other.Tunisians are no longer tolerant nor good to one another. We put ourselves and our material needs ahead of our brothers and sisters. I know it’s hard considering the economic state of the country has been terrible for us and the image of our country, but after a decade of debating and voting none of that has come to avail.

Why must we keep relying on our government and its officials to improve? Why must we let a select group of people dictate how we interact and treat one another. We do not need money nor a political opinon to be Tunisian to one another. Tunis is distinctly different from the arab world because despite our regression, we remain still ahead of the rest of the Arab World socially. Tunisia is a civilisation of diversification and has been for 2 millenia .To the extent, that the rest of the Arab world look at us and believe we aren’t Arab enough.We celebrated our differences with our joy to live and love. I know to many, being open and tolerant is a Western perversion but the truth is that it portrays what Tunis is: A bridge between Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Let us not villanise each other for being consevative or porgessive. Our conservatism is needed to remind ourselves of who we are and where we come from. The other side of this coin,  is our progressivenes helps us connect with the world beyond us and move us forward as a society. My implication with this is that we neeed both sides to remain ourselves as well move forward.

Let us be kind and loving to each other once more. It no longer seems people trust or like one another. Help those who need help without expectation but also with kindness and fondness. Do not put a price on helping each other out.  Do not sell yourself like the many politicians we elected in the last decade. Let us protect each other from brutality and corrpution instead of relying on a police or government to do so. For the longest time we’ve had a bribing culture that only dies if we stop being so cheap and demanding of one another. Not everything needs to be “Ifra7 beya.” You will be empty and drinking, smoking, or drugging yourself numb because you’ve allowed a piece of paper to consume you. I know to those who have less this seems like bullshit, but how else do we stop having to pay for so much without removing this culture to begin with.

Our country no longer feels safe to walk around. Our sisters are too afraid to walk alone for even the most basic of things. We do not need to label them as whores for wearing what they want or drinking or being out. The same has to be said for our sisters  who are more conservative and religious. They are not terrorists, they are our mothers, aunts, and sisters. Religion is important in community building but do not let outside forces manipulate, dictate and  pervert our Islam into something hateful and bigotted. We must not allow violence or hatred or bigotry to be inflcited upon them by anyone. What if it was your own mother, sister or daughter? These women are the future of this country and the mothers to our childre; OUR FUCKING FUTURE. This doesn’t apply only to women. We can all agree as men that we are constantly paranoid and afraid of each other and their intentions. Enough the bravado macho behavior and let go. Our role as providers doesn’t extend solely to the amount of money we make. We must provide emotionally through respect and acceptance. Let’s stop fighting with each other and acting like hooligans over our inflated egos. We are being harassed and bullied by those who wear unifroms because we are constantly fighting and hurting each other. Our mental health as men is a big problem because of the social pressure and lack of empathy for one another. Set aside your ego and ask for help and give help to your brothers in return.

To my fellow youth, I beg, we are the future whether we like it or not. Let us not repeat the mistakes of those who came before us. Regardless of your financial situation please put your education, physical health, and mental health ahead of the social expectations and material needs indoctrinated into us. The future of our politics is shaped by what we accomplish, as well as the standards we set for the future. Only then do the branche of our government and institutions fix themselves. An entire generation of the elderly will soon fade away and we do not have to be like them. I know it can feel at times like we are trapped here, but to many outside of here they view this country as paradise. Let us build this paradise not just for ourselves but for our elders and our children. Let’s clean our streets, our beaches, the air we fucking breathe. Put down the cigarettes, alochol, and drugs and start to accept the pain. Only through pain, hardship, failure do we grow and mature. Do not numb yourselves to the point where you can no longer see the light at the end of the tunnel.  Let us be better friends, who celebrate, laugh, love, live, and most importantly work. Do not judge those who have less or more than you. We feel we deserve more but the reality is, this kind of thinking is flawed. The world is ruthless and it owes you nothing. If you dont give back to it, it will swallow you and extinct you.

I aplogise for how long this message is and I’m sure most of you won’t make it this far. I am sorry if speaking English is a barrier to anyone but I am not francophone and I don't have to be in order to be Tunisian. My blood bleeds red and white I promise you as it does through your veins as well. Let us come together so that if the day of reckoning comes, we stand and bleed together in face of any impending doom. I repeat, we need only to treat one another as equals, and love endlessly. That is Tunis we live and dream for, whomever we elect will not give us that.

Please let's be Tunisian with one another again. Do not let the last two decades of corruption, poverty, racism, biggotry, and hatred define you and consume you. Whether Kais is good or bad, please remember, the powerful prey on the weak by turning themselves against each other. Creating a problem in society and acting like theyre the only ones who can fix it. ONLY WE CAN FIX IT BY BEING BETTER.

God bless Tunisa, God bless you ,wa inshallah a7hna wa  rabi deema nahmyw fi b3athna. I love you all, my brother and sisters.

Power that could quite easily become a dictatorship with zero intervention possible from other branches to stop him.

The problem isn't KS, it's who comes after him.  Maybe he has good intentions and wants more power so he can do the things that can save Tunisia but, the person after him, would have the power to do what is best for THEM instead of Tunisia.

 short answer: LOOOOOL 

Long answer: Boycotting the referendum is the best choice and it is the one which made this referendum a joke and without any credibility. Here's why:

- First of all, the ""yes""result was ready from the begining. Saied [have already said before in this video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AGNsAmP-iz0) that referendums is a tool used only by dictators and that any referundum held in any arab country will have a ""yes"" result. So he literally admitted that he is a dictator and told us the result of the referendum even before its begining. Yet, some people still insisted on participating in that circus🤡🤡.

- Second, the number of participants is clearly FAKE. Despite the big number annoucned by the ISIE (~ 2,5 millions), there were no queues or any sign of a huge presence of voters. The centers were empty. 
Imagine that at 9:00 am, more than 500k have already voted which is even higher than the same numbers of the 2019 presidential elections when the numbers of voters was exceptional.

- Third, even if the majority voted ""no"", the result will still be ""yes"". In fact, the ISIE is appointed by Saied himself and there was no international observers. He also didn't respect ""samt inti5abi"" and many other rules.  So adding an imaginary number of ""yes"" voters to the total isn't that difficult. Even if we suppose that a 2 million  boycotters voted yesterday, the total number of voters will be near 5 millions which is impossible since that number was not even reached in the 2019 presidential elections when the queues were very long and the centers were overcrowded. So, saied will always add a number of yes voters to the total to ensure the majority.

- Fourth, even if the result was ""no"" (which was by no mean possible), Saied will neither stop his new constitution nor dismiss. I already made a discussion [in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/vrdwwz/saied_really_meant_what_was_written_in_the/) showing how Saied delibrately changed the 139 chapter and removed the ""no"" scenario from Belaid's constitution. Saied have already interpreted many chapters in the past in a very wierd way that suits his interests, so I don't see anything stopping him from doing this again.

- Finally, the boycott has succeed. In fact, in democratic countries where the opinion of people is taken into consideration, any referendum with a rate of participation less than 50% is invalid. The 25% (which is fake) is still a very low rate and it is a big sign of the failure of this referendum (in the opposite of  what Saied is claiming).


In the end, the 93% results proves that this referendum is invalid. I thought the results will be 50% or 60%. I didn't expect this dumb move which is made by every typical dictator.

You must know that Saied is a dictator, so no democratic move can stop or remove him including voting ""no"" to his silly referendums.",,,,,,2022-07-26 14:07:53

Booked a two week long trip to Tunisia thinking that I do not need a visa (until recently, Uzbekistan was one of the countries that had a 30-day long visa upon arrival agreement). Checked the embassy website again last weekend and Uzbekistan isn’t on that list any longer. I emailed the embassy and tried to call them to inquire about the expedited visa process, but they’re not responding and not picking up the phone. 
I’m thinking about flying to DC and trying to get a walk in appointment. So my question is, how possible is it to a)get a walk in appointment in the first place and b)get a tourist visa in a day or two.

Here we are on the first post-referendum day, and I thought it would be interesting for everyone to come up with a reflection, take a step back, and imagine a positive path for the country in an ideal scenario, although in practice, it's unlikely to succeed. To tell the truth, myself, I barely followed the news concerning the referendum. All that I did was to read diagonally the text of constitution submitted without really having previous references to be able to cast an enough relevant critical eye. I am totally unaware of whether the new separation of powers only foreshadows excesses, the why and how a certain number of people agree that the parliamentary system was dysfunctional. I don't know neither how this new constitution is supposed to grant sovereignty to the people. But never mind.

In short, as you'd've understood, I am completely outside of all this for the moment, and I reserve the right to conduct in-depth research a posteriori to form a solid opinion on the situation. Whether you voted yes or no, whether you boycotted the referendum, or whether you think it was rigged, I invite you to put that aside for a moment, and try to think about this question: What are the work axes to prioritize these days?

By this, I'm thinking above all of the economic methods (the type of market to adopt, the priority areas of development (like, real estate, agriculture, etc.), local short circuits, imports/exports, etc. ..), to the role of young people within the national project, to the orientation chosen in all that concerns development, the fields of innovation (as tiny as they are (computing, medicine, research, engineering, programming, artificial intelligence ), etc...

What should be identified and labeled as a vector of unemployment and precariousness of the ""zaweli"" in Tunisia. Without forgetting the case of the forgotten territories of the republic, namely the West coast (Kasserine, Le Kef...) and others like Sidi Bouzid, Kebili, Tataouine.

&amp;#x200B;

In your reflection, by way of example, if you were to cite education, try an approach of the type: What are the dysfunctions of the current education system. What should we change? Is it really relevant to force education to a certain extent when many children from poor territories are hastily taken out of school to help their parents? What is the place of Tunisia in a world where innovation, internet, programming etc. are gaining ground in many countries, often regardless of their level of development (Nigeria, India, etc.)

If you are talking about diplomacy, avoid giving answers of the type: Fares USAbigot or Abdelweheb Vladimirov... Instead, prefer the diplomatic philosophy to adopt in trade, the geographical areas to turn to, the case of pan-Arabism, etc. ... You can of course criticize foreign powers that do a lot of lobbying like Qatar for example, but make sure that this is only a minor part of your thinking.

&amp;#x200B;

And finally avoid talking too much about the separation of powers. Here, it is not so much the levers/tools that we seek to question, but rather the philosophy of development and reconstruction to be expected, and to hope for.

You can obviously address social issues, but avoid dwelling too much on the relationship of society to religion: I think we are in an in-between that kinda satisfies both secular and religious, whereas we are not on the verge of becoming a caliphate, just as much as a future Western society. Even if tunisian people have gained a lot of maturity on this subject, the fact remains that tackling this kind of thing strongly obscures much more serious and important problems.

There you go ! Tell us what you have on your heart, your hopes, and your ideal vision of the Tunisian future. Be respectful of differing opinions, but feel free to challenge ideas civically.

À vos claviers !

And God Bless Tunisia.",,,,,,2022-07-26 22:23:22

I chose the math section and I chose the spanish language as the option back when the highschool gave me the option paper.But back in June I changed my mind and I put german in the government site .So I don't know which option they are going to direct me in bac.

I did a formation this month(July),I studied A1.1 german and A1.2 spanish(I had some knowledge of spanish beforehand).And now I'm flip-flopping between them and I can't decide so can you give me some of your personal experiences.

If I'm being honest the only interest that I have in learning spanish/german is becoming fluent in more languages and for opportunities abroad.


P.S:

-I read some previous threads on this sub but I want to get more info since some people told me that german bac is just A1.1 but others told me it's the entire A1(I heard the german exam is easier)

-I considered learning them both but it would be too hard especially with summer ending soon",,,,,,2022-07-27 12:04:41

ونزيدك أكثر ننساو موضوع عدم تكافؤ الفرص، كان النتيجة جات كما حقيقتها إلي هي متقاربة برشة، شكون ينجم يأكدلي إلي في حالة هكاكة سهل فيها التزوير، بضعة الاف أو مئات يقروا النتيجة (و [صارت مع جورج بوش للعلم](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_United_States_presidential_election#Voting_machines) ) شكون يأكدلنا إلي هيئة منحازة مش بش تعمل شي؟ خاطر متحتجش بش تمس أي نتيجة كانها 90% أما كي تولي 50% حديث اخر.  إذا كان النتيجة ناقصها 20 ألف صوت، تحتاج فقط ل3-4 مكاتب إقتراع في تونس الكبرى متواطئة بش تبدل النتيجة 

يزيو بربي من التبسيط المبالغ في الأمور. نجمو نتناقشو في حاجة بالمعقول أما مش صحيح انو المسألة بسيطة والتصويت هو الحل. ",,,,,,2022-07-28 00:35:05

wa9oe2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/wa9oe2/quel_est_lavenir_dun_développeur_après_15_ans_de/,5,Quel est l’avenir d’un développeur après 15 ans de carrière ?,"Vous êtes-vous déjà posé la question de ce que vous ferez après 15 ans d’expérience ? 

Après 15 ans d’expérience en tant que Dev, il vous reste encore 25 années avant la retraite!🙂 

Cela fait déjà un moment que je souhaite écrire sur ce sujet. Une réflexion que j’avais déjà bien mûrie durant mes années passées à assister des milliers d’ingénieurs en informatique qui partent s’installer en France. La crise du Covid est passée par là et est venue accélérer la chose. 

J’ai notamment eu de très nombreux échanges avec des ingénieurs IT tunisiens et marocains. Et j’ai été surpris par le nombre d’entre eux qui ne se sont jamais posé la question de ce qu’ils feraient à 40 ans une fois qu’ils auront 15 ans d’expérience dans leur domaine. En sachant qu’ils leur restent 25 ans de travail devant eux…

Ils sont complètement déboussolés par la question, et souvent comme ils n’y ont pas pensé auparavant, ils répondent qu’ils continueront certainement à coder jusqu'à leur retraite. 

&gt;**Pourtant ne pas s’y préparer à l’avance est une vraie prise de risque.** 

Tout développeur devrait se questionner sur le futur de sa carrière. Même s’il est vrai qu'à ses débuts il est difficile de se mettre face à une telle question, elle s’invitera de toute façon inévitablement au bout de 15 ans de carrière. Alors autant s’y préparer dès l’âge de 35 ans…

Il est assez courant de voir des candidats écartés d’office par les recruteurs en France parce qu’ils ont plus de 40 ans. Un diplôme sur une techno spécifique obtenu 10 ans auparavant a de fortes chances de devenir obsolète dans un marché en évolution constante. À moins que (mais c’est plutôt rare) de rester en veille constante sur les technologies émergentes. 

Sur le terrain la réalité est encore plus tranchante, les seniors sont remplacés sans aucun ménagement par des candidats plus jeunes qui sont plus à l’aise avec les nouvelles technologies. Et malheureusement ce Turn-Over régulier a un impact négatif direct sur la fin de carrière des ingénieurs. 

Le constat sans équivoque que j’ai pu en faire c’est que l'âge où l’on commence à être déjà “trop vieux” c’est 40 ans. À 45 ans c’est déjà trop tard si un plan B n’a pas été envisagé. Face au mur, il devient plus difficile pour les développeurs de rebondir et de trouver de nouvelles opportunités. 

&gt;**La bonne nouvelle c’est que des solutions existent.** 

Après des années d’accompagnement de plus de 5000 ingénieurs IT, j’ai pu observer des comportements, des prises de décisions, des changements de parcours très diversifiés. Chaque ingénieur IT, chaque développeur que j’ai rencontré durant ces 10 dernières années a un parcours différent. 

Certains ont un véritable choc, lorsqu’ils entendent pour la première fois alors qu’ils n’ont même pas 40 ans : “tu fais du Dev depuis 15 ans maintenant, tu comptes faire quoi les 25 prochaines années ?” 

C’est une réflexion très déstabilisante quand on ne s'y est pas préparé. 

Mais la bonne nouvelle c’est que plusieurs pistes et plusieurs solutions existent, il suffit de s’y préparer :)

J’ai regroupé ci dessous quelques pistes / axes qui s’offrent à un développeur expert (15 ans d’expérience) :

* **Devenir Consultant spécialisé (Assurance, Telecom, Banques…)**
* **Rejoindre un pôle de Management ou direction d’un grand groupe**
* **Créer son ESN ou sa Startup**
* **Revenir dans son pays natal et lancer des projets**
* **Devenir Investisseur ou Business Angel**
* **etc...**

**Toutes ces pistes sont possibles, mais il faut choisir et se préparer pendant quelques mois, quelques années avant de se lancer.**",,,,,,2022-07-28 13:14:37

BUT, being super traumatized from Tunisie Télécom,  I am afraid that in case of an issue with the phone line, Télécom won't honor their part of the contract and won't fix it.
So basically the question is:

The fact that I have a contract with orange for the wifi, does it guarantee a better service for the phone line from Télécom part?

We tried talking to the few investment funds and some incubators/accelerators and we're NOT very excited about their expertise nor their way of doing business (a circle of friends and influencers aka m3aref w as7ab).

We're solving a real burden on the backbone of digital transformation and modernization. 
We're looking to raise 150K TND to hire a couple of senior team members and prepare a go to market campaign.

Early investors will be able to get a faster exit as we prepare to incorporate in the US where we have a few investment leads for a serie A.
The First foreign investment means acquiring your shares in the tunisian entity which will become part of a global entity. 

I am the founder, please get in touch to know more.

&gt;**« Envoyer un CV pour postuler en France, demande de respecter certaines règles lors de la rédaction de ce précieux sésame. »**

**C’est une information essentielle que nous prenons soin de transmettre à tous les candidats qui nous contactent. Le message est on ne peut plus clair :** ***« vous devez impérativement adapter votre CV afin de ne pas être confronté à un refus net »*****. Puisqu’un CV qui ne répond pas aux normes d'une société, peut paraître désorganisé et sa crédibilité risque même d’être remise en cause par les recruteurs.**

**Ainsi, un CV destiné au marché des ESN françaises ne sera pas rédigé et mis en page comme on écrirait un CV qui sera envoyé à une SSII tunisienne, marocaine, sénégalaise ou encore ivoirienne. Des détails qui pourraient sembler optionnels, voire anodins dans ces pays doivent nécessairement apparaitre sur un CV en France.**

**Existe-t-il un CV type pour postuler en France ?**

**Il n’y a pas de CV type à proprement parler. Mais votre curriculum vitae doit suivre un fil conducteur, et correspondre aux standards auxquels sont habitués les équipes RH en France. Il faudra s’affairer dans ce sens, et mettre en évidence les points essentiels qui seront parfois scrutés « à la loupe ». Vous réussirez ainsi à vous distinguer aisément par rapport aux autres candidats étrangers.**

**Et dans cet objectif, nous vous conseillons vivement de suivre le Template de CV que nous avons réalisé en collaboration avec les équipes RH de nos ESN partenaires. Et que nous mettons à disposition de tous les candidats qui ont besoin d'effectuer la refonte de leur CV.**

**Ce Template va vous permettre d’organiser votre CV afin de permettre aux recruteurs de s’y retrouver et d’entrer dans le vif du sujet dès les premières lignes. Notamment, en précisant d’emblée, quelles sont vos compétences et quel est votre champs d’action.**

**Comment bien structurer son CV ?**

***Pour effectuer une bonne refonte de votre CV, il devra être rédigé en tenant en compte l'ordre des rubriques suivantes*** **:**

1. **Vous devez commencer par indiquer votre nom et votre prénom, suivi de votre poste actuel,** **ainsi que de votre** **niveau d’expérience, sur la partie supérieure droite de votre CV. Vous préciserez également vos coordonnées téléphoniques ainsi que votre adresse e-mail. Et juste en dessous, devront apparaître votre âge, et votre adresse de résidence.**
2. **Sur la partie supérieure gauche, vous pensez certainement à une photo. Exact ! Même si le CV anonyme est accepté par certains recruteurs. La premier coup d’œil à la recherche de la photo du candidat est un réflexe instantané. La photo d’identité est donc nécessaire, et elle se doit d'être sobre, sur fond blanc ou uni.**
3. **Vous allez maintenant aborder votre vécu professionnel. En commençant par votre domaine d’intervention. L’expérience sur le terrain, la pratique, c’est ce qui intéresse avant tout une équipe RH. Est-ce que vous êtes un candidat averti ? Que savez-vous faire concrètement ? Cette rubrique permet d'avoir une première idée sur votre champ d’action.**
4. **Vous allez enchaîner avec vos compétences techniques. Le recruteur va vérifier ici que vos acquis correspondent réellement au exigences du poste que vous convoitez. Et il effectuera un parallèle avec votre domaine d’intervention. La liaison doit être évidente et sans aucune ambiguïté.**
5. **Est-ce que vous êtes unilingue ? Bilingue ? Trilingue ? ou peut-être polyglotte ? Il est important d’indiquer les langues maîtrisées ainsi que le niveau de maîtrise.**
6. **C’est le moment de décortiquer votre cursus universitaire** **en listant les formations que vous avez suivi et les diplômes que vous avez validés.**
7. **Et enfin, arrivent vos fameuses expériences professionnelles, qui vont justifier les compétences précisées en début de CV. Il s’agira ici de donner dans l’ordre le nom du projet, l’intitulé du poste occupé, la liste des missions réalisées, et bien évidemment dans quel environnement technique vous avez évolué C#,** [**ASP.NET | Open-source web framework for .NET**](http://asp.net/)**, Javascript, php etc.**
8. **Vous avez ici le champ libre pour parler de vos centres d’intérêt, de vos loisirs et de vos passions.**

***Concernant la longueur de votre CV*****, les équipes RH ne pourront accorder plus de quelques secondes par CV pour un premier coup d’œil. Un aperçu qui sera bien souvent rédhibitoire. Pour passer au-delà de cette première sélection, votre CV doit donc être concis et aller droit à l’essentiel. Il se résumera en deux pages grand maximum selon l’enrichissement de vos expériences professionnelles.**

**Pour conclure, inutile d’essayer de trouver une alternative face au CV version imprimable, rendons les armes, il résiste avec force. Et il garde sa première place d’élément décisif lors de l’étude d’une candidature. Alors ne le sous-estimez, il semble avoir encore de belles et longues années devant lui… ;)**

***Si vous êtes ingénieurs en informatique ou développeurs et que vous souhaitez adapter votre CV au marché français, nous vous enverrons volontiers le Template sous format PDF. N’hésitez pas à le demander.***

**Vous avez maintenant les clés entre vos mains pour adapter parfaitement votre CV aux attentes des ESN françaises.**

**Bonne chance à tous !**",,,,,,2022-07-30 19:16:05

Thank you guys so much for your perspectives. I wasn’t expecting such a response. After the reading the comments I felt I needed to describe myself. I am a young man in his very early twenties, with dual nationality. Yes, I never thought about it, but I am quite white or “gawri.” I am however fortunate in the sense that I can develop a deep tan during the summer. In the winter I turn extremely pale. My father, a foreigner, is strawberry blonde and turns red as a lobster in the summer, whilst my mother is Tunisian and somewhere in-between. After living and being in out of Tunis for over a decade,  I guess I’ve identified with being Tunisian for so long that I couldn’t differentiate myself.

Yes everything sounds great, but I literally live with a broken heart, the moment I stepped out of that gate in the airport, I felt a strange feeling, like if I'm not the same person anymore, I miss the old me. I never thought I'll be saying this, I always complained about the country and wanted to immigrate but I didn't expect it to be this hard. I miss my mum, my sister and her kids: my nephew and my 1 y.o niece(who calls me mum btw), my fiance for sure (at least he'll join me at some point), my friends, my life there and tunis, yes this is unexpected.. but I'm really considering one thought: make some money with my partner in few years, lance a project between uk and Tunisia.. so I can be flexible one day between the two, more likely so I can stay in Tunisia as much as I want.. in brief guys, family and friends are priceless.. and truly I don't think I'm going to spend the rest of my life away from home.

ضن الناس العاقلون وأنا منهم أنا المآسي قد اندثرت بلايلي التمحريث محطم الشبيبة الجميلة و التصبيح القاتل برائحة الدخان و القهوة المذرحة ,ولكن ...

.هنا بضبط ، خيل لي  أني أحلم ولكن بالفعل سمعت بداية دق طبول أشرس معركة في تاريخ حياتي ، كنت جالس على ضفاف البحر الناتن إلى أن تأكدت من روية  اساطيل  الإغريق المتعشطة تتقدم نحو ضفاف بحور طروادة  …ماذا ؟؟

طرح السؤال العظيم : ما العمل؟ شنوا الحل ؟ كيف ل انتظر طول هذا الوقت لانال شهادتي الموقرة و أنسى الدمار النفسي و نصف جسدي الذي خرب من التمحريث طيل سنين أطول من عمر النبي نوح ؟-السؤال واضح و تبين فال الإبان أن الجواب أوضح من شمس الفجر الصادق ، الجواب هو : ما عليك إلا الانتظار حتى يرضى  عليك إلي يسوى ولي ما يسواش-

ولكن الانتظار ياكل الوقت مثل ما يشيب شعرك ، و لا تنسى أنا سفن العدو قادمة لا محالة …

\-كان لي طريق سهل لجعل وقت  الانتظار  أقصر ، طريق أمر من الحنظل ، كان مجردة فكرة قبل أن تنتهي إلى ما أعظم ..لم أدري لماذا كانت السفن متجهة صوبي ، من ارسلهم و ماذا يريدون مني ، أهم حقاً الاغريق قادمون لل إنتقام ؟ و- لكن يا صديقي أنا لم اخطف الياقوة  هيلين

التفسير الأكثر منطقاً هو أنهم متجهون ل لغاية شخصية  , نعم انا الآن أدري لماذا ولكن لم أدرك شيئا حينها ، الحاصل ،صراحة يا صديقي كنت اشرب الكحول من وقت الآخر ، الكل يعلم أنه يقتل الوقت و يروح عن النفوس المهمومة ، لكنه حرام فال العقيدة وسامْ  في العلوم و مدمر لل المال …وبدأ الشوط ألاول ، اللذي كان خفيف الظل ولكن هو المسؤل الأول على إحراق و تدمير مدينة طرودة  الى الأرض  …

ماذا لدينا الليلة ،A GANGSTER MOVIEولا ماتش CHAMPIONS LEAGUE ???

في كلتا الحالتين كان الجو رايق ، كعباتي و أكل الوالدة و ال كمبيوتر  في حجري

استمر الأمر هكذا يوميا ، كل الليلة الكحول يداعب أعصابي ،

في صدفة ، إلتفت ل أحد اصدقائي القوي التفكير و قال لي انني اذا واصلت هكذا سوف ينتهي الأمر بدمار المدينة   و أن تلك  السفن العتيدة متوجهة لي ،  صوبي وإن أمسكتك ف أنت في  مازق مظلم و انك ستعيش أيام ضنكة في قرية محروقة  بعد أن يتمكنوا منك . لقد نبهتك و الامر بين يديك …

بعد تخمام طويل ومليء بل احاسيس ، نظرت صوب الحائط و ماذا فعلت ؟   حملت كعبة البيرةو- وضعت يدي على الحلال ، في وهلة ... تصور شريط حياتي كيف أني ستهجم  عليا سفن الاغريق و  يلعنوني بعلة الإدمان و كيف  أن الثلاث سنين القادمة من حياتي ستدمر المدينة التي بنيتها حجرة على حجرة ..في ضلام تلك اليلة من شهر مارس القارس صعدت إلى قمة المنزل لئشاهد السفن العتيدة متوجهة صوبي ، تنتظر ماذا سافعل  ، حرت وقتها  ،كان الكحول انيسي الوحيد الذي يعطيني النشوة الخارقة والبسمة الصفراء ولكن في نفس الوقت كان يدمر في سلام مالي و صحتي ، الاختيار صعب يا صديقي ، ماذا س تختار في مكاني HEIN ،؟

&gt;كما تذكر الهيئة أن لا أحد يمكنه تبرير عدم تطبيق القواعد المبينة بالقانون الأساسي عدد 63 لسنة 2004 بجهله بالقانون. ولقد نص الفصل 90 أنه ""يعاقب بالسجن مدة عام وبخطية قدرها خمسة آلاف دينار كل من :يتعمد معالجة المعطيات الشخصية دون تقديم التصريح المنصوص عليه بالفصل 7 ..."".

The INPDP also asked any Bolt user to submit a complaint with them so they can represent you and legally go after the app.

Si non, je m'explique

Le but est de mettre un popup bloquant le pc au sigle de Microsoft demandant aux gens d'appeler un numéro pour les mettre en relation avec Microsoft, la majorité des personnes au bout du fil sont tunisiennes et n'ont pas l'air d'éprouver le moindre scrupule d'arnaquer des personnes âgées ou handicapées en récupérant par la même occasion leurs économies et leurs données bancaires et même plus.

wdl897,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/wdl897/why_tunisia_becoming_a_dictatorship_is_inevitable/,0,Why Tunisia becoming a dictatorship is inevitable,"Following the most optimistic studies about climate change, we are expected to hit a global increase in temperature  of 2 degrees Celsius IN THE NEXT 5 TO 10 YEARS.

Globaly, this means (again being very very optimistic) that 100 million + people will have their living areas submerged under water and flooded (look at UAE this week) 

Tunisia is going to be highly affected by this in coastal areas.

1 billion refugee immigrants will be escaping their inhabitable lands which means most of the Sub-Saharan ones will be passing through north Africa and Tunisia as much as Tunisians will be trying to escape to Europe 

Our droughts which have been catastrophic (as a hunter from a farmer family we and the community have noticed this way way more than the average person) with less food production, water scarcity increasing etc will lead to 300 million experiencing starvation and thirst.

Is Tunisia prepared in any way or shape to combat any of this ? 

Imo Tunisia may very well collapse in the next 10-20 years.

The paris agreement of limiting this increase to 2 degrees has already failed and we will be reaching 3 degrees very soon.

4+ degrees is apocalypse mad max level shit with most countries burning and billions dying.

With 2 degrees we will already get gunned down by Italians, French and other Europeans while trying to escape our inevitable doom while having millions of refugees coming to our lands.

How is anyone optimistic ? 

Is it from ignorance ? 

Look at ours forests burning today, look at the prices of food, the infrastructure, the water scarcity 

In 5 years it's gonna be 1000x worse.

Our democracy was not prepared to do anything.

The dictatorship will not be either but I see it as something that would have happened anyways as the country would collapse very soon.

In times of crisis it's either fascism or socialism that takes over. 

Just hope that we will not be the abused puppet of Europe that is forced to deal with the immigrants while millions will die.",,,,,,2022-08-01 16:09:02

Getting a simple document ( madhmoun, carte e-dinar..) has become hell, you have to wait for at least 45 minutes before they tell you to come back next week, you go back next week they tell you the same thing. No one is doing his job correctly, you have to know someone ( aktef ) in order to get a simple thing done, a thing that you 1000% have the right to get without the intervention of no one. People's mentality is just trash, all I see around me is people with no ambition in life, a good life for them is getting married, having a car and a house. There is no public parks for the youth to play, they recently built a basketball court in my area and they just closed it ( tahky m3a l3ases t9olou 5anelaabou y9olek thebhom ytardouni? ). 
Things have been this way for years, and with time passing by, I'm becoming more aware of the shit we living with. I'm not being a victim here, as I said, I'm just describing what I see on a daily basis.

I am a React Native/Kotlin engineer with one year of experience. I'm working at a company in Sousse for 1400dt (CIVP) and I live with my family, so I have almost 0 living cost expenses and I save about 1200 dt of my salary. I had an interview with a company in Tunis for a React Native/kotlin developer position, where they asked my about my salary in my current company and I told them sincerely what I make (1400dt) and that I have no rent or any kind of expenses. I made a coding interview with them, where the questions were 70% off-topic and almost non-related to technical stuff in React Native or kotlin. they replied to me they are really interested in my profile (as I was part of developing some applications that are published on the store) with 1600 dt salary package (without sivp). I refused the offer, they replied again, that they want me to work with them and the offer was based on my performance in the coding interview, and they asked what is my salary expectations. I don't know what to do.  
PS: before they reply to me with their offer, I made it clear that I won't do anymore CIVP, even if have more months with it.  
sorry for the long explanation, but I really need your advice, as I have no idea how companies in Tunis operate. thank you",,,,,,2022-08-02 16:24:05

I am honestly quite bumped out that i was so close to making it so i am wondering if anyone with a slightly similar experience or has good knowledge can give me advices or suggestions on what i can do

My family (mostly my mother) isnt too fond of pharmacy and thinks it has no future and well i myself since i was young i wanted to be a doctor so bad

I was wondering if either i can study pharma while preparing for reo medecine to get a chance at medecine and change from pharmacy or if i should abondon pharma for a year and only focus purely on reo med for higher chance of getting it but ofc there is the risk of losing a year for nothing

Mom also plans on signing me to campus france to study abroad anything (medecine is highly improbable), as much as i want to go abroad i dont feel that interested in ingeneering and other stuff or try to see if i can move out to somewhere else in general like maybe mauritania to study medicine but i honestly dont feel she would be as reliable bc she doesnt know that much and just asking her friends

wenkhi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/wenkhi/it_student_looking_for_guidance/,3,IT student looking for guidance,"Greetings!Long story short, I'm a ISET student, I just finished my first year and I came 2nd in the whole department with a 15.14 average which I'm pretty happy about. I am looking for advice on what to do after I'm done/ while I'm finishing my degree. In the next paragraphs I'm gonna talk a lot but I'll leave a TL;DR at the end.

So a little bit about me, I graduated Technical BAC last year, wasn't even going to do IT, but after some convincing from my cousin, I went with his advice. I've been using computers since I was 6 just playing games. But in the last 3 years I started becoming my friends' go-to ""tech support guy"" and I'm always happy to do it. What I'm trying to say is, I have experience troubleshooting problems and I've developed some great googling skills, I've also gotten to the point where I fix problems without googling them lol.So as part of my studies, if you know ISET you know that they're much more ""Hands on"" than Universities, we do a lot of workshops and I find it easy to pick up a new thing, for example, we were taught the most basic of Linux administration and I found myself really enjoying it, same thing with Networking, I always nail the Labs the teacher asks us to do and again, I LOVE IT.6 months ago, I've discovered that Hacking and Cybersecurity isn't just dark knowledge and that it's actually very approachable for a tech guy, so I've started binge watching Hacking videos such as CTF challenges, DefCon talks(If you're a tech guy and you've never seen a DefCon talk, you're missing out) etc...Programming wise, I can't really say right now as I only know what was taught to me at school which isn't much, but I made 1 ""useful"" script to scrape the results of students from the institute's website which was very fun, I've also put the results in a CSV and did some ""data cleansing"". I think If I give it enough time and effort I can make it work but I'm honestly more interested in the stuff I talked about above.**TL;DR I know my way around a computer, I can google things, I'm interested in Cybersecurity and I know basic programming.**

So my questions are:

1. What now? What should I do to better my chances at getting a job or even making some money on the side by freelancing
2. What next? Where do I go after finishing my studies, should I even finish my studies?
3. I am thinking about moving abroad in the future, preferably an English speaking country that doesn't make you bankrupt if you dare to cough, or make you bankrupt if you try living in it /s. Canada or Australia are my prime choices.
4. If I were to stay in Tunisia, are there any security companies worth working at?
5. Since I'm a ""Majeur de promotion"" I have a chance to apply for an engineering degree, is it worth the ~~2~~ 3 extra years?
6. Is a cybersecurity degree at the TEK-UP university worth it (after I finish my current degree)? I can probably get the same knowledge online but will having that degree and university backing help me?
7. Not a question, but if you've got any other feedback/advice, I'd greatly appreciate it

I know it's a bit too long of a post / too many questions xD Thank you for taking the time to read it if you did, I'll be waiting for your response!",,,,,,2022-08-02 21:23:47

My Tunisian passport has expired in 2012 (and probably so has my Tunisian ID card, which I can not find). I have never needed it to travel back to Tunisia (always used the French passport), hence why I never renewed it, but I now need to renew it.  


Among the required documents to renew listed on the Consulate website, I can see it is asked for a copy of both the Tunisian ID card and French ID card (or Carte de Séjour).  


Does this mean I need to first ask for a Duplicata of my lost expired Tunisian ID card in order to renew my passport ?

I noticed it seems to be a popular tourist destination for French and Germans. The country seems to have a lot of issues with trash, stray dogs, cats, half built buildings, poor water quality, bad drivers, cars that smell awful, and waiters who look like they hate their lives.

I know every place has it's bad spots. But for Tunisia it seems to be the majority of the country. I kept asking myself why do Europeans come here? 


Europe has beaches, clean air, nice restaurants, tourist zones, clean parks, clean roads. Yet they chose to visit a place with none of that.


I enjoy relaxing vacations. I've never been so stressed driving down the street, dodging cars, dogs, people. The cops appear to enforce nothing but love standing at checkpoints. 

I know there are some important historical landmarks here and all that, but go out the exit from any tourist spot and your back to trash. 

Sorry if anyone gets mad. Just an observation, this place seems terrible and I can't wait to leave. I just wish I could take the dogs with me.",,,,,,2022-08-03 20:08:16

I found it through local rent/sell groups on Facebook. I had contact with multiple “samsaar” that found the right place for me. It’s important to find a samsaar that is professional and proactive. The search was a bit stressful because they always put pressure on you (both samsaar and landlord) to decide immediately if you want to rent or not. 

Original post:

So after two years my mf’ing landlords told me I should leave my house and search for something new. They’ve really made things difficult for us (not giving us a contract when they told us they would, not wanting to repair anything, now this…) and I’m desperate now that I have to leave my home. We are in Kelibia and right now everything for rent is only for “saayefi”. 
We are looking for a very specific house (individual, garden, quiet quartier…) and I don’t know where to start. The house I’m in now, we stumbled upon through a Facebook ad. 
To make things as easy and fluid as possible, is it best to search through Facebook or a real estate agency? What are your experiences and what is best?",,,,,,2022-08-04 09:51:55

Posting again about a pet travel issue, not very happy about it but I hope I can find some solace and comfort in your traveling experiences.   
I wish to know how the checking-in with a dog can go at the check-in counter?   
most importantly, do the counter agents check that you have all the necessary documents for your pet transit?  
I ask because I have hit a big hurdle with the official vetenerian who won't issue the EU sanitary certificate off a technicality that I had my dog microchipped after I vaccinated him against rabies, and not before, which somehow makes all the difference in the world and he can't overlook this detail and says that I must redo all steps from scratch.  
I have all the necessary papers from my treating vetenerian (Who is far more qualified and works for the Ministry of Internal affairs than this guy) such as  a sanitary certificate for transit and my vaccination records, and I also carry the results of the titer test and have waited 3 months since I got them, which means the dog is now fit to travel and poses no threat to spread infectious diseases like rabies.  
I just want to know, will they allow my dog to board the plane? will they ask about this missing EU certificate at Carthage? my treating vetenerian told me to flip him off and go anyway and that it'll be fine. I'm just very worried and scared, I hate bureaucrats.",,,,,,2022-08-04 11:04:35

I am a 22 year old female student from the UK, I am coming to Tunisia in September as part of my final year in university studying Arabic. I am here for 3 months, before anyone suggests going somewhere else to learn Arabic I cannot change where I go and Tunisia was decided by my university! I understand the dialect is very different from MSA, but I hope to learn as much as I can and make the most of it as I am very open-minded and want to enjoy myself as much as possible. 

I have previously lived in Jordan for a year so I speak some Jordanian/Palestinian dialect of Arabic and my fusHa is pretty good, I am also fluent in French. I have a feeling Tunisian life will be quite different to Jordan, I was wondering if there are any facebook groups / clubs etc I could join that might help me make friends here? In Jordan the friendship groups were quite split into male/female, is it the same in Tunisia? I would really like to make some good female friends in Tunisia.

I am really excited to start my academic year in Tunisia, I will be living in Carthage and that is where my university is. Does anyone have some recommendations for activities, things to do, sights to see, food to try etc? Any suggestions are welcome :)",,,,,,2022-08-05 13:08:49

In 10 years our education system will be so outdated that our degrees will be worthless abroad.

The point is to keep the door open so middle class and poor families kids can ""escape' too.

Eventually, only upper class Tunisian kids can leave the country not on a ""شقف"".

As someone who studied in school where the chemistry lab ""يسخنوا التجربة في زَزوة "" and volunteers each summer to fix school equipment, I believe each school should have a public ""gofundme""/""cha9a9a"" where funds are used to improve the quality of the teaching without passing by the wasteful bureaucratic system.

&amp;#x200B;

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PS: I feel sad seeing how some grown-ass people can't debate the idea and are attacking me instead. Obviously they are victims of the حافظ مش فاهم system.

PS2:  I'm calling for opening the doors for direct crowdfunding of schools (voluntary).100 euros/year donation can maintain a classroom in a remote primary school in a rural area.

It's a moral engagement from someone who is financially stable toward the future generations.

For the filling I boiled chopped potatoes then mixed it with can tuna and parsley. Then I added salt and pepper and put it in the pastry. Cracked an egg in there and boiled.

My brother in Canada bought it from Bangood website and set the delivery address to Tunisia, to my home.

 It was sent through EMS logistics (paid option)... I received a call from TNT, a company located in Tunisia's industriel zone if I remember correctly... They told me come take your parcel.

Well i got to the place and demanded that i get my parcel, they told me it's a Smartphone! (Note: TNT is a delivery company that works with Diwana in same space, kinda) I told them so what? They told me first I have to pay the ""magasinage"" fee! Basically a sum of money for storing the phone in their ""magasin"" for 3 days, they said 200 dinars I was like ""wtf""...

Well i wish it ended there.. but nope, they also told me that you won't get the phone unless you get Diwana/Custom approval! I went to Diwana office, waited for 2 hours to finally get a meeting with one of the high ranking officials, and as soon as she heard my case, she told me ""Why did you buy a phone from abroad?"" and ""don't you know that such acts hurts out economy?""

 I swear to God she was toxic as heck, in darija we say ""shamta"". Her voice tone was quite offensive... Anyway, she refused that i take my phone and she threatened that she would issue a ""send back/return"" to where the phone came from.

I asked her kindly and kinda begged her to give me the damn phone, I told her that I already paid 200 dinars, she said you know what, for such a value item you're obliged to pay 220 dinars more as part of custom duties regulations.

I told her ""wtf"", the phone would cost me 420 dinars extra in total?? That's insane! She told me , don't waste my time your phone will be at our disposal for a limited period of time, pay the required amount and you should be good, we will get you your import authorization papers including phone registry.

Anyway, without extending the story any further, long story short, I ended up giving them the 220 dinars extra (420 tnd in total) and they released my phone. It was a nightmarish expérience tbh, so rude, so harsh.

It's official people went jail for this.," This is a repost of my old post because, it's official now, people went to jail for losing SIM cards.

[The  INPDP  just confirmed that.](https://www.facebook.com/INPDP.TN/posts/pfbid0WhnQLBs7QH1j2YAvWtn3rMFw8bszPe1qQxGwxQVhK59W6AHLVL12pcLkqe937FzTl)

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using a SIM card registered under your name use the USSD code **\*186#** to list all the SIM cards registered with **your CIN** on ***THAT NETWORK***.

If you have multiple SIMs on different Networks do it on each on of them.

Check for your parents and family too.

You are legally liable to anything done using any SIM card registered under your CIN even if you don't recognize it or claim it was lost.

Many sad stories of innocent people being involved into criminal and even national security related investigations because of ""ghost"" SIMs linked to them.

Losing a copy of your CIN is not something negligible or simple.

SIM street salesmen are paid commission per SIM sold. Many of them, as you can guess from the way they harass you on the sidewalk, don't respect the rules and don't stick to the procedure. Some will turn a blind eye as long as they get the commission.

You don't want to find out that your ID has been stolen the hard way like this guy that lost his passport, visa, and job offer abroad and now under ""National Security"" investigations because his ""lost"" SIM card from ""ايامات المبيت"" was used by some criminals.

PS: if you unfortunately found some rogue SIMs under your name do not burn them on the spot. Go to the network provider boutique and ask the agent for when was the last activity of the SIM and if it coincides with your last use then it's ok, just burn it.

But if it is currently being used you may consider reporting it the police if it is being heavily used. Ask the agent for the frequency of the balance recharge since they ""can't"" officially give you the call history without a formal request.

Heavily used stolen SIM usually means the user is selling illegal products.

PS2: Do NOT register any phone on Sajalni.tn for other people. Only register the phones you bought for you or your family.

Some scammers will claim forgetting about the [sajalni.tn](https://sajalni.tn/) registration and post in expat groups asking ""who landed in Tunisia recently and can register my phone pleeeeeeeeeease"".

Once an **IMEI** is registered under your passport you are liable if the phones where stolen from abroad or if after that been used by criminals (you will be the last known suspect) .

To check if a phone is ""legal"" in Tunisia use **\*999#**",,,,,,2022-08-08 15:16:26

The man says: My daughter is under some sort of heavy cyber bullying, from a fake account, they all belong to the same person, the idiot sometimes when she stops accepting freshly new profiles he started making fake accounts with the name and same profile picture of siblings stating that they git they're facebook passcode lost and they had to start a new one, anyways you can guess what happens next, even tho she stopped using a smart phone completely knowing that it is not a good solution, I as a father i can't ignore the threatening, I can't be by her side 24/7, and I also can't take her back to the stone age, no smartphone no internet, can't keep her always at home either, true at night no going out but what about outside ?! Her internship her university her friends and whatever..

The thing drove her to dig a little into the fake profiles he used, one by one until she tried something and on that page where you can reset the facebook she found out there is a number in one of them, a phone number ending by ******15, unfortunately that's as far as she managed to go.

Asking all around all we managed to know that technical police only can reveal the full number and find the guy, police officers are always mocking me saying that this is normal internet behaviour and she just ignores, me on the other hand can't call down, she is my daughter after all how can i calm down....

Sorry for the long story, but this is as far as i managed to learn from this gentleman, he asked me to post everywhere , maybe someone here might have an idea, a way to go, a contact or even a solution here.

Hello . I’m 18 , she’s 17 . We’ve been friends for since high school started we always fought a lot , most of the people around us were telling me that she had a major crush on me while she was denying it pretty violently . We had a big fight (amongst the others )then lost contact for a couple of months . I went back to talking to her a couple of weeks ago . What’s wicked is that now I feel like I want her whereas she didn’t attract at all when I could go past the friendship with her . My intentions are unclear . All of her friends have apparently been telling her that I’m no good for her and that we should never talk again even though she said she missed me and wanted to keep the special bond we once had in her eyes . I don’t know if she’s doing this out of friendship or if the flame is igniting again and that’s why I came here to have some peoples opinions about it . Thanks .",,,,,,2022-08-09 00:45:31

I fucking hate it. After 4 years here, I am seriously considering moving back to good ole Mestir. First off, I have to admit that we're relatively wealthy there, but not rich, maybe top 20%. I am not even alone, one of my best friends there is half-French but refuses to move to France and instead studies and works in Tunisia. I am very patriotic and I always wanted to help fix Tunisia but at this point I don't know \*what\* to fix.

The one huge advantage in Europe is the better pay of course, but they also just work much much more here. Starting as early as elementary school where they only get 6 weeks of summer vacation. Most of what they talk about is wörk, and they focus on it their entire lives, streets here are completely deserted by 10pm even in a big city. Really the only fun they have is in the few weeks of vacation. Truth is, Tunisians are very lazy compared to the rest of the world (based). In Tunisia, there's always someone to socialize with cause people are friendlier and not as busy, our nature is much more fun. Great beaches with very clear water, non-depressing climate... Our food is SO much better like you wouldn't believe (they actually consider McDonald's a good meal here lol). My point is, they don't actually get to enjoy their wealth and just end up spending it on more expensive cars or bikes or mattresses or whatever, basically stuff we also have but more expensive. Would that make you happier though?

Another big complaint I often hear is that Tunisia makes entrepreneurship very hard along with many many many other political problems. I think that's true but you'll be just as disappointed in nearly every other country. Germans for example pay more than half of their income to the state (income tax, vat, diwana, various small fees, etc.) but just never complain :\^). Literally some laws here would cause a rebellion in Tunisia. You only have to look at Reddit's front page to see how corrupt American politics is.

The only thing that really pissed me off about Tunisia was the trash problem. 7atta ki nimchi n3oum nal9a 100+ canet celtia fil 93ar, 3leh haka :(( ? Also the typical tkoulif, Tunisians should mind their own business a bit more imo

Maybe it's just Monastir, maybe I am extremely privileged without knowing, or maybe I have other priorities, but I just don't get you guys. Also maybe suggest a better place, only one that comes to my mind is Switzerland, but that's just another league.",,,,,,2022-08-09 03:32:07

Should I use a Payoneer account ? (Since I have some money from my games on itchio and it only accepts Payoneer and PayPal to withdraw your money)

1. \-a- Is it safe for Tunisians (I heard some people saying their accounts got blocked , but I doubt they did something against the rules) .
2. \-b- Can I keep a large amount of money on Payoneer ? So that if I travel for exemple I can use my money without being under the mercy of the couple thousand dollars limitation forced by the Tunisian authorities .
3. \-c- Can I send large amounts of money (eg : 10k $ , converted to TND) to my local bank account ? If I show them the game on Steam and itchio , will they accept it ?

I finished my professional masters this year and thought about enrolling in a private engineering school.

I know they are both considered BAC+5, but the title of engineer (which a lot of job positions require) and the possibilities of continuing my PhD Studies (Doctorat) are the reason for my choice. It doesn't seem reasonable to redo my M2 as a research masters just to access PhD studies.

As for the field, I choose software engineering (Génie logiciel et Systèmes d'informations), The reason is I wanted something I enjoy and at the same time all-encompassing (A software engineer might work as a data scientist but not necessarily vice-versa).

By the way, I don't intend on enrolling in ESPRIT since it seems it's not being recognized by the OIT ([source](https://www.oit.org.tn/%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%AC%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AA/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B5%D9%8A%D9%84?tx_news_pi1%5Baction%5D=detail&amp;tx_news_pi1%5Bcontroller%5D=News&amp;tx_news_pi1%5Bnews%5D=7933&amp;cHash=25497e04e048d4de81731ca13724de43), or lack thereof) .

Here are a few more questions

1. For now I intend on choosing between Tek-up and Sesame, which one do you recommend and why ?
2. Is the ABET (U.S.A) label from medtech more recognized than the EUR-ACE (european) one ?
3. Concerning the EUR-ACE label, Is there any difference between ASIIN and QUACING accreditation organisms.
4. Since most of them are not yet confirmed to have the label, do you think they will get it this year. or is it just a marketing scheme ?
5. Do you have any other uni or IT field recommendation and why ?

tl;dr : I didn't intend to make it this long, but for short I wanted to know which one was better for software engineering, Tek-up or Sesame ?

wkv3ir,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/wkv3ir/lets_build_a_reformist_mindset/,18,Let's build a reformist mindset,"Hi fellow Tunisians, how are you doing? I have something to talk to you about.

I've noticed that so many people fall into these patterns:

* This country is bad, get me out of here, take me to Europe/elsewhere.
* This country is bad, this world is a bad place, it's so unjust =&gt; goes into depression and hopelessness.
* This country is so corrupt, let me take advantage of that.
* This country is doomed, there's nothing I could do, let's live as if everything is fine.
* This country is doomed, I don't care, let me enjoy my life and focus on maximizing my pleasures.

I think we should rather implement this pattern instead: This country is bad, let me help reform and improve whatever I could according to my limited means. If my efforts are fruitful then الحمد لله. If not, then at least I've done my best.

Don't carry the burden of saving the country by yourself. You don't have to reform the whole country. Simply start by improving your community, neighborhood, your relatives and most importantly yourself. Don't neglect the impact that your small deeds can have on society. Our small actions can induce a [domino effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL2WlXdbjH0) or a butterfly effect.

You don't have to reform the educational system, finance, culture, military, technology, transport all together by yourself. Choose just one domain that you're familiar with and cooperate with other like-minded people.

Don't just sit there doing nothing and complaining about how corrupt this country is. Instead go do something, even if it looks insignificant in the eyes of others. Look what our prophet ﷺ said:

\- لا تَحقِرَنَّ مِنَ المَعْرُوف شَيْئًا، وَلَو أنْ تَلقَى أخَاكَ بوجهٍ طليقٍ

\- **أَنَّ رَجُلًا رَأَى كَلْبًا يَأْكُلُ الثَّرَى مِنَ الْعَطَشِ، فَأَخَذَ الرَّجُلُ خُفَّهُ، فَجَعَلَ يَغْرِفُ لَهُ بِهِ، حَتَّى أَرْوَاهُ، فَشَكَرَ اللَّهُ لَهُ، فَأَدْخَلَهُ الْجَنَّةَ**

\- قُلْتُ : يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ  مَاذَا يُنَجِّي الْعَبْدَ مِنَ النَّارِ ؟  قَالَ : "" الْإِيمَانُ بِاللَّهِ "" قُلْتُ : يَا نَبِيَّ اللَّهِ ، إِنَّ  مَعَ الْإِيمَانِ عَمِلٌ ، قَالَ : "" يُرْضَخُ (ورضخت له رضخا، وهو العَطاء ليس بالكثير) مِمَّا رَزَقَهُ اللَّهُ ""  قُلْتُ : يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ أَرَأَيْتَ إِنْ كَانَ فَقِيرًا ، لَا يَجِدُ  مَا يُرْضَخُ بِهِ ؟ قَالَ : "" يَأْمُرُ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ ، وَيَنْهَى عَنِ  الْمُنْكَرِ "" قُلْتُ : يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ ، أَرَأَيْتَ إِنْ كَانَ  عَيِيًّا (عييا: أي لا يحسن البيان.) لَا يَسْتَطِيعُ أَنْ يَأْمُرَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ ، وَلَا يَنْهَى عَنِ الْمُنْكَرِ ؟ قَالَ : "" يَصْنَعُ  لِأَخْرَقَ ""  ، قُلْتُ : أَرَأَيْتَ إِنْ كَانَ أَخْرَقَ (وهو الذي لا يُحْسِنُ العَمَلَ) لَا يَسْتَطِيعُ أَنْ يَصْنَعَ  شَيْئًا ؟ قَالَ : "" يُعِينُ مَغْلُوبًا "" ، قُلْتُ أَرَأَيْتَ إِنْ كَانَ  ضَعِيفًا ، لَا يَسْتَطِيعُ أَنْ يُعِينَ مَظْلُومًا ؟ فَقَالَ : "" مَا  تُرِيدُ أَنْ تَتْرُكَ فِي صَاحِبِكَ ، مِنْ خَيْرٍ تُمْسِكُ الْأَذَى ،  عَنِ النَّاسِ "" ، فَقُلْتُ : يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ إِذَا فَعَلَ ذَلِكَ  دَخَلَ الْجَنَّةَ ؟ قَالَ : "" مَا مِنْ مُسْلِمٍ يَفْعَلُ  خَصْلَةً مِنْ هَؤُلَاءِ ، إِلَّا أَخَذَتْ بِيَدِهِ حَتَّى تُدْخِلَهُ الْجَنَّةَ ""

Do you have some money, tools, means? Give or lend it to a friend that is working on a beneficial project, or to some poor person that merely makes it to feed his children. You see your friends wasting their money, time and opportunities? Give them council and help them out. Do you have Photoshop and design skills? writing skills? print flyers, create info graphics, create a blog and start writing articles. Complaining why there are a lot of ignorant people? Go out and reach out for them, teach them and spread awareness.  Complaining that our country is filled with plastics? raise awareness, make a sustainable plastic-free shop, provide alternatives to people, make it easy for them to adapt lifestyle changes.

If you're capable of thinking, have some knowledge, have some social power or status, then you're responsible. Because this country is filled with people that are incapable of thinking correctly, many of them aren't even aware and don't have the same means and opportunities that you do. That's why, it's your duty to use your influence to guide people towards righteousness. Don't waste your talent and skills in vain things. Instead work towards helping others, sharing, looking after people's needs, forgiving the ignorant and sincerely wanting to benefit others. Don't do it so that people praise you.

If you're interested in activism, sustainable living, living a moral life, religion, self improvement, looking after the needy the poor, orphans, widows, animals etc... Then let us hear you out, tell us about your struggles, your projects, your goals, your vision. We can help each other and make things possible for a better future if Allah wills.",,,,,,2022-08-10 11:34:20

I'm Tunisian and I traveled lately to Tunisia for few weeks. I noticed that most people seem to be inherently angry or rude. For instance when I go buy something from a store the cashier doesn't look at me or even respond to my greeting.
In the streets people beep at you for the smallest thing while you drive and don't even consider you while you cross the street (I almost got hit by a car)
When I stand in a line, people always that come after me try to get service before me. I literally have to defend my place.
In the airplane on my way to and from Tunisia there were arguments between passengers on each way. (I travel a lot and only saw those arguments on Tunisian flights)
And then of course there's no notion of personal space... Strangers get too close to you in line or while talking to you to the point that they're almost touching you.

The only place I saw people behaving well as a group is in the mosque during Jumua prayer.

I'm not sure if this is because people are stressed out and under pressure, or if it's just a culture...",,,,,,2022-08-12 06:33:52

Let me just tell you that what happened to me today is downright fucked.

It was none other than the person who happened to be my father ( yup, so fucking lucky) to give me the greatest performance of all times on how parents can simply fuck up their own children's wedding. 

I am marrying a Muslim foreigner. I finally got the invitations ready to hand out to possible guests. I sent a picture of the invitation to this person ( yup, "" my father "") and guess what he did ? He exploded and said that he is not coming to the wedding anymore ( he lives abroad ). Why ? That was my first question and the answer was that in the invitation, I put my husband's parents real  names and last names. What the fuck, right? Hear me out because what I knew next was pretty fucking amazing.

This father of mine turned out that he was going about telling everyone he knew that I was marrying an Algerian European and , therefore, the fact that I put these REAL names meant that he will be seen as the liar he ACTUALLY is, since their real names are as foreign sounding as it gets and now he is forcing us to change the invitations into his liking and come up with Arabic sounding names so that this fucker will be happy that his lies will not be found out. To this hour, I have not the slightest clue as to why he did it, knowing he NEVER mentioned anything to me or my mother before, and why of Algerian descent ? ( no fucking idea ).

He got his jacket he wore it then he told the police officer that if he worked a life time he will never be able to afford a jacket like his. The police officer didn't respond. This is just one example.
A big part of being a police officer is not to react to provocations by citizens and anything less is wrong. But, in my life I knew plenty of Tunisian that push the limit of what is humanly possible.

So I graduated last year from university, I was studying engineering, and I decided to take a long time off before getting a job.

I only started looking for a job now, but I was informed by a friend that a number of the Neighborhood dudes are included on a list of guys that are being ordered to enlist in the military training (the list is in el mo3tamdia).

Now I'm left wondering what kind of options I've got. I'm not exactly opposed to military service as an idea, even if it might be a living hell, but it's going to set me back a long time from doing the things I actually want to do, including finding a job at the moment. Especially since I'm looking for opportunities abroad and I'm not even sure if I'm allowed to leave the country in this situation. I just feel stuck doing nothing.

A friend sent me [this page](https://legislation-securite.tn/ar/law/40868?fbclid=IwAR3WTEfsTAqJIgvoG8Otf6iCveIJmjUYvh2XpSmlc4MdcrU3aMEs6PxD_VY) containing military service laws. I'm not sure if it's up to date or not, and I'm not sure if I understand it clearly, because there seems to be some missing details. Maybe it's incomplete.

But from what I understand I can either delay it by looking for a master's degree, or I can enlist in the second type of military service called ("" التعيينات الفردية"") where you serve for a little bit and pay off the rest of the time, but I don't understand it fully and I'm not sure if I fit the necessary conditions for it.

Any kind of help or advice is deeply appreciated. It's a little stressful, I don't even feel good going outside of the house, or going to the mo3tamdia to check and ask.

Passing by a police officer makes me feel like a fugitive or something. I just want to start looking for a job without the extra stress and pursue my goals. I'm willing to serve a shortened period and even pay if I have to. If I have to look for a Master's degree, do you know one that I can easily apply to and be accepted in in a short period?

I doubt that I'll be accepted in my original school since I wasn't accepted last year, plus I'll have to travel hundreds of kilometers to the capital to go to it and apply, and that may result in police officers checking my ID and I don't know if that'll get me into trouble.",,,,,,2022-08-13 16:14:11

Hello, I got accepted to study in a French university, I'm born and raised in Tunisia and I'm trying to get a student visa.
Tunisia's main administrative language is Arabic, but as you know, Passport has to have your name translated to it's latin version.

When I applied for my passport, the agent who worked on it decided to add a letter to my surname because it would sound like the Arabic version.

In my diplomas and other school documents, my name is ""Arbi"" the simplified version of my surname that I choose to write cause no one pays attention to such detail here, whereas my passport has the  letter ""L"" added to it .. so it became ""Larbi""... Which is pretty much exactly how you'd pronounce my name in Arabic.

So I'm depositing my Visa application within these coming two weeks and when I tried to fix the passport.. I was told that it would take up to 6 weeks, time I don't really have seeing how I need to show up in France before 09/19th.

I am ready to accept that version of my name whenever I have to submit it in a formal administrative procedure. But all I care about is my Visa application, I'll have to submit my diplomas with the visa application.. and the diplomas have my ID number written on them, Same ID number that exists in the passport as well.

Could it ruin my chances of getting the visa ? Where'd It'd pretty much waste a year of my life.

PS: my university acceptance letter has the simplified version of my name that I entered.. I received the letter before my passport was delivered.",,,,,,2022-08-13 16:21:48

Hey fellas, I am seeking your help to **find** and/or **identify** a piece of lost media from the mid to late 90's..

I do not recall the exact name of this show, but I remember enough details about it to write a general description:

\-It aired on Tunis7 (**تونس** **7**) sometime between noon and the afternoon, between *1996* and *1999*.  
\-It was for kids, but it was not animated, it was rather a **puppet show** (something like *Sesame Street*, but with a wider shot).  
\-I believe the original production was in *Arabic* and not *dubbed* from a *foreign language* because the script and play on words felt original (but I could be wrong)  
\-The name of the show was something like ""**منارة في الفنارة**"" or something of the sort

# Plot:

The parts I'm *POSITIVE* about:

\-A girl (most likely named ""**منارة**"") was on a ship with her *dad*, the ship wrecked and the girl washed up on a beach.  
\-The girl was taken in by an old man who turned out to be the *lightkeeper* in the *lighthouse*.  
\-The *lightkeeper*'s name escapes me, but there's an emphasis on him being old and frail, gray hair showing from the sides of his beanie.  
\-The girl is waiting for her *dad* or looking for him or something, and that is kinda the premise that the whole plot is based on.  
\-There is an *antagonist* in the story, some dude with a *brown jacket*, and there is something thick in his face, I'm not sure whether it was a thick moustache or thick eyebrows, but it was thick as fuck, and he had at least one *goonie/yesman* with him (either that or he talks to himself when he's plotting stuff).  
\-The *brown jacket guy* has it in for the girl (or her father).  
\-The *lighthouse* is the center stage for most events.  
\-It was supposed to have a **season 2,** I distinctly remember season 1 ending with a cliffhanger right around the climax, and the ""*to be continued in season 2*"" showing up on screen.  
It's been bugging me since I was a kid that I never knew what happened afterwards, as I had apparently gotten hooked to that show back then. (And this is why I'm seeking it today) 

The parts that are kinda *foggy*:

\-The girl constantly has *flashbacks* from the *shipwreck*, or remembers her *dad* saying stuff.  
\-There could have been a *treasure* of some sort involved.  
\-The *brown jacket guy* might know the girl or her dad in person  
\-Most of the plot is the *brown jacket guy* trying to hurt/kidnap the girl, and the *lightkeeper* defending her.  
\-The original crash of the ship that the girl was in has something to do with the *lighthouse*. (It was myseriously turned off that day or something, I don't recall)

&amp;#x200B;

This is all I could remember, if anyone of you folks remember this, or even if it rings a bell, please don't hesitate to contribute, it's been driving me crazy for some time, and I cannot even recall the name or find an archive of the TV7 children's shows anywhere.

I come to you with a very personal question regarding my situation.

We partner and I would like to get married in Tunisia.

I am a non-muslim french and she's a Muslim Algerian. Because of traditions and beliefs it is important for her family that we do a religious marriage.

Tunisia seems like a good place to do so as we both like the country and it is easier for everyone to travel there, i.e., no visa required for both families. 

In France it is quite common to see a non religious person marrying a catholic one, if the couple is ok with it so is the priest marrying them.

I am wondering if the same could happen in Tunisia or if I must convert to Islam beforehand.

Yet it was never offered the same degree of financial and diplomatic support that other young democracies have enjoyed. Instead, Tunisia’s growing economic crisis and deteriorating political situation were drowned out by the myriad conflicts around the Middle East and North Africa. While a Tunisian Marshall Plan may not have saved the country’s transition, greater financial support could have helped Tunisians weather the painful side effects of the economic reforms needed to create long-term sustainable growth. Today, Tunisian civil society actors and political opposition figures need both rhetorical and financial support from the international community for their efforts to drag Tunisia back to the democratic path.""

wq6hha,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/wq6hha/torn_between_staying_or_leaving_tunisia/,24,Torn between staying or leaving Tunisia," I'm so torn between staying or leaving Tunisia in the future.

I have a good relationship with my parents and I appreciate them a lot. They both want me to work in another country after I finish my degree since the industry I chose isn't that big in Tunisia and I've always wanted to leave too, I don't see myself doing well here, and even if I do it won't pay me well. I work in film vfx and my goal is to be a vfx supervisor one day and the field here and in other countries is so different since others are much more advanced so it'll be a whole different experience. We barely even use vfx here in Tunisia.

But the thing is, I'm so attached to my family, and thinking of leaving my parents alone breaks my heart. Both my siblings have left already, one is in japan and the other in europe and the house feels empty without them so I can't help but think how my parents would feel if I leave too. They're both getting old but dad still works all day so my mom would be all alone when usually I'm the one who keeps her company. 

 One of my goals in life is to make my parents happy and pay them back for everything they did for me. Even tho they had many problems they still tried their best to raise me well and I appreciate that a lot. We have never traveled together so I want to take them on a vacation in the future, take them to good restaurants, and do the family things we've never done before because they were always busy and couldn't afford such expenses. I just want to see them happy and know that I'm the reason for it.  
However I know that if I stay in Tunisia and work here It'll take me so long to save up for something like that, I'll get paid minimum wage but If I work in another country I'll get paid in a better currency, I also don't mind working a lot and saving up so it'll be much easier and faster to save money.  


I don't know what to do, I still have a lot of time to think more but I also want to hear others' opinions. Am I too attached to my parents? What do you think is better, stay here or go aboard?",,,,,,2022-08-16 21:40:37

wqayks,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/wqayks/lets_please_collectively_stop_saying_money_amounts/,22,Let's please collectively stop saying money amounts,"1 malyoun (million) refers to millimes. Which are worth nothing today. So when are we going to stop talking in malyoun and milliard.

The correct thing to say is ""10 lef dinar"" which is precisely 10000 TND (not using commas to avoid confusion with decimal points). Or even ""3achra kilou"" is so much more precise even if it sounds slang.

Someone that has 1000000 TNDs is a ""millionaire"" not a ""milliardaire"" (millionaire not billionaire).
Like you say ""dinar"" would be cleaner to day ""3achra dinar"" instead of ""3achra lef"" which is absurd. Myet dinar, alf dinar, 10 lef, 100 alf, 1 malyoun dinar and so on.
I don't get it when some people just look at me like I'm inventing words when I say ""10 lef dinar"".

Anyways.

I learned some very basic words, however my pronunciation is obviously terrible, as I have never been to African country, could they view it as offensive? Or should I try to learn even more words?  
Tipping. We booked all inclusive service, however I learned people working at hotels are underpaid and tips can make a large portion of their earnings. I will happily respect that, however I am unsure how much is appropriate to tip the waiters and bartenders, etc. since we won't be paying in cash for anything?

Dad is a man who literally cherish routine, his career and of course saving money. He be constantly refusing to go on family vacations, have a dinner or a lunch together, go to a concert or mahrajen, or even going to the mall, and m telling y'all he got all the money to do this activities but still be dragging us with him in this infinity loop of routine and this killing us slowly. Mama is trying her best to entertain us but she's short on money and I'm totally grateful for her and I will cherish her to the last day of my life.

In the other hand, the fact that me and my bro don't nearly have any contacts with any of our cousins, the distance between us is getting bigger by time, we tried to talk to them but they are not putting the effort in our relationship with them and it becomes forced and awkward as long as we talk to them. That consider this matter to be a big problem in my life coz we're Arabs are known for our strong family relations and yeah most of my friends are on a good terms with their cousins and be having the best time of their lives. 

I wish if there someone i can relate to and I'll stop here coz I nearly expose half of my family's secrets.

If the government open the sky, that means we would have Ryanair, WizzAir and else companies operating at Monastir, Djerba, Tozeur, Tabarka, Enfida and else... and bring more millions of tourists each year. So I don't understand why the government prefers to sacrifice millions of euros and thousands of new jobs to protect Tunisair and Nouvel Air... 

Example, there is only one flight from London to Tunis each day with Tunis Air against 10+ for Morocco with different airlines...

Morocco took the risk to open their sky and Royal Air Maroc is still operating...",,,,,,2022-08-19 09:22:52

So I'm a 20 year old dude who's inspired by many to go chase my dreams. My first year at college wasn't bad but I'm studying something I don't really like. I spent 7 years in Pioneer Middle and High School, brainwashing us that we're ""elites"" and stuff. but even tho I graduated from high school with an honors I got 0 chance of chasing my dream abroad because gov thinks that talented people are the ones perfect at everything (according to a one-time exam).

I tried applying for Japan but it was pure BS, Campus France said no and North American Colleges often look for those who pay much. Even my parents don't think of investing in my future as they selfishly get in debt but to expand our house and buy more land (The Conservative Tunisian Beliefs). So financial support from them is near impossible.

So I'll really be glad if someone who has succeeded in getting outside LEGALLY could share their experience with me, preferably with the initial cost being symbolic (the airplane ticket/visa, governmental fees). *You'll be really saving my motivation from dying.*",,,,,,2022-08-21 18:03:08

As a result, I've lost most of my Arabic. 

I still have some (I can understand far more than I can speak) but it's so embarrassing when I come back to Tunis to visit family and they can all speak three languages and I've basically forgotten my first language.

Long story short, I'm an industrial engineer I'll be graduating in like a month. Tbh I've got a job offer at a big company but at a shitty pay ( like all the industries here ) . Now , what i wanna be in 5 years can't be achieved here Sadly ( not only cz the shitty pay , but also our industries are primitive) so I'm looking for a way out ( like 99.99% of the population) 

I figured i have 2 options : either accept the job , build up some experience and apply for jobs abroad 
Or find a masters abroad, study there and hope to land a job while at it .

For now , option 2 feels like the one with higher chances,  but all the masters i could find costs a hella of money .

So if you guys know anything that can help with the second option or any recommendation, it's all appreciated .

Services such as Discord and other websites using cloudflare are accessible as intended. I am very glad they did not  censor it, and it seems to be just a technical issue with DNS.  
I would like to note they took about half a day to fix it, which might seem to be a lot but knowing TT and other ISPs we Tunisians got, this is very good compared to the usual""wait until monday"" .  


Edit 1: Seems like it isn't just me, and it isn't just ""Tunisie Telecom"" (although it's still most likely them, they provide for the rest).Calling them through one phone number (1200) would go through, a woman who suggests me to call their other number (1298) Even though on their website, the first number is the correct one.1298 doesn't even work (maybe too many calls saturating their line? I don't know). Yet again, Telecom and their bullshit.VPN Time.

Edit 2: Just like how u/azizbna pointed out, Phone data seems to be working fine, which makes me think either this is temporary by Telecom lines or, phone data will sadly follow and get blocked later on. Hoping for the former.

Edit 3: Again following a comment from u/azizbna , it does seem that all of the unavailable  websites/services were using Cloudflare, which means Telecom blocked Cloudflare, or they have some sort of technical issue? Who knows  


&amp;#x200B;

~~Anyone got that problem today?At first I thought it was an internet problem which could be fixed with a quick reboot, but rebooting didn't help. Half of the websites I usually go on (and apps like discord) aren't loading for me, whether it's on pc or phone.Status online shows those website seems to be running fine, which leads to me thinking it's my internet.So I'm wondering if it's (yet another) Telecom problem?

I'm a British Muslim (non Arab) professional and I'm coming to Tunis for work for some time (my company is sending me). I'm sort of semi- practising like a typical second or third gen Muslim grown up in France say..  What are the best neighbourhoods to rent a place? How much is typical rent in an upmarket area for a 1 or 2 bedroom apartment furnished? What''s best for nightlife? I don't speak very good French but a little. Will it be easy as a Muslim to make friends with local Tunisians or would I have to mix with expats? Also, I've read online that if you are seen going to a mosque regularly you can be harassed by police? Is it true?! I am more into Sufi Islam and zawiyas and shrines of holy people. Are there Sufi communities or mosques in Tunis where one could go to do dhikr? Also how easy and safe are the best neighbourhoods in Tunis? I have worked in  Morocco before and really loved it there so is Tunis similar? Any advice would be appreciated. Like for example, excluding rent how much money would be enough to live a comfortable or elite lifestyle per month? I  am culturally quite Europeanised but also proud of being a Muslim so what I don't want to do is just mix all the time outside work with expats. I'd like to hang out and get to know educated Tuinisians too and local culture. How easy is it to meet Tunisian women if one is also a Muslim (not talking of prostitutes)?

wz0pa0,https://i.redd.it/dyo5poixs8k91.jpg,108,"Bunch of kids robbing a tourist in Cleopatra beach, Sousse","Was with my parents just earlier and behind us, kind of isolated, was a tourist sunbathing. We noticed two kids (the one in yellow and another one selling tea I couldn't get on camera) talking to the guy. We thought nothing of it at first but soon after we noticed the tourist struggling and trying to hide his things. We yelled at the kids so one run and the second (the one selling tea) managed to snatch a small bag (probably containing a small camera) but then ended up returning it and fled.
Under 15mins later the guy in yellow who clearly didn't give up, came back and started talking to the tourist again.
That's when my dad and I went over and led the kid away. 
I spoke to the tourist (who spoke English) and apparently a bunch of other guys were ganging up on him in a different spot so he came to a calmer place before these two kids came up to him. Thankfully nothing was taken from him and I advised him to get closer to families to be safer.
He didn't some to move so I'm pretty sure he's getting robbed. Hopefully not.

I need your help with something, so I really want to get out from Tunisia and move to canada, I'm still a student (1er cycle ingenieur), I want to know what is the process to go and live in Canada (with my family if possible)

How can I do this? What are the requirements? Can I go before finishing my studies? If you've done this is it worth it? 

The reason I chose Canada is because I heard that it gives you citizenship in 3 years (a thing I believe even money can't buy) and I wish that I can go as soon as possible to finish those 3 years as soon as possible.

Feel free to talk freely, if you think this is a brilliant or shitty idea, let me know

wzrqsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/wzrqsy/communism_in_tunisia/,5,Communism in Tunisia,"Disclaimer: I'm a total newbie in politics and all my knowledge about communism comes from a couple of videos I saw on youtube, this post is just meant to get some answers about somethings that I saw in the past and couldn't explain, also I have 0 knowledge about tunisian politics and all I know is the president's name.

Context: Back in the days, just after the revolution (2012-2014), I was still a young teen 12yo, I saw a center opening close to my home with a big communism symbol hunging on it, a bunch of youngsters (age 18-23) were having regular weakly meetings at that place, I don't wanna judge people by their looks but they all had a similar clothing/style pattern, they all looked like the ""3ami9in"" style we see today, ngl I thought that they are cool people back in the days and I admired them for having a strong political sense at a young age, even though I literally don't know anything about the ideology they are supporting. 

The trigger: I've been watching a lot of tv shows lately such as peaky blinders and stranger things, I've never understood the political sides of the story, but 1 idea was pretty much very clear "" Communists are always the bad guys"" and every time the symbol appears I know a new villain is about to be introduced. 

The small research I did : So I wanted to understand what is communism and the idea about it, I watched a couple of short videos explaining it with simplified words for people who have no interest in politics, and after watching them I was interested in the idea but I didn't see any possible way that it could be implemented especially in today's circumstances.. And tbh I don't understand how people with apparent strong political knowledge might support it, I also saw videos criticizing nations that tried to adapt the model and described it as a total failure. 

The question: I wanna know what those youngsters might have been talking about, and are they really supporting communism??  Is communism a thing in tunisia? And If there is any tunisian communist in this subreddit I really wanna know why does he support this ideology, I may have missed some details because of my lack of knowledge but I really wanna know your intake about this matter.",,,,,,2022-08-28 09:56:59

I’m 22, heavily inspired by Alaïa, and have hopes of creating brand that’ll help not only myself, but also bring attention to the country. I wanted to ask a few questions that would help me in the long run.

1. What do you spend or are willing to spend on clothes per year?

2. What determines whether you’ll spend over your budget for a clothing product?

3.What clothing products do you buy the most and how frequently do you buy them?

4. Does quality matter to you? By this I mean how durable of a product are you expecting (how long do you expect the product to last? How good do you expect the fabrics and construction to be?)?

5. What is it about brands or fashion, in Tunisia, that you don’t like?

6. What fashion ( which articles or styles) would like to see more of in Tunisia? 

7. Are you willing to be part of a community surrounding the brand?

8. If a brand is helping create jobs for actual people who make/ tailor them, does this affect your purchasing decision?

9. How much is too much for an article of clothing?

10. Finally, what draws you to a brand? 

Thank you so much to those willing to contribute. Your input means a lot to me.",,,,,,2022-08-29 01:10:32
x0cw27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/x0cw27/you_guys_owe_me_an_apology/,0,you guys owe me an apology,"Hewwo everyone omin here.

I guess i have to apologize from everyone. From my post asking about some stuff and wether it's legal or not.

In the post i admitted visiting onion sites (not the fbi honeyposts. You need a potato for a brain to fall for that) and consuming disturbing media such as red rooms. As well as mining crypto and preforming a ddos attack on my neighbors as well as hacking their wifi.

Well let's do it bit by bit.

*ONION* : since i am here in my grandfather's house in this exact desktop (ik i am posting this on my phone but i don't want the keyboard noises breaking the silence) i visited an onion site for the first time. Three or four years ago. I think it was just a thread page like a place where people ask questions and all you know.but i was way too scared. I do it because i like the feel of it. Exploring a world of new sites that 99% of doesn't even use css because .onion files have just a body-type thing no style. But yeah visiting.onion sites is fine and harmless.


*Red rooms* : i only saw like 3 of them (were hard and risky to find) the first one i saw was sent to me on discord 4 years ago by someone i know. It was a japanese red room.i barely finished it without puking but still that night i couldn't sleep i was shaking (i was 12 duh) but red rooms helped build some guts up i don't enjoy watching quite the opposite i feel disturbed watching them but yeah. Idk if it's because of the red rooms but when ever someone close to me dies or something bad happens i don't cry or even get sad when my brother died when my grandpa died when my uncle died when my aunt died (not close to me but i saw a kid and his sister walking and the a big-ass van struck them the girl didn't survive and was bent with the tire but the boy was injured and that's it) so yeah i don't watch them for fun i think people miss-understood the word entertainment i was refuring to entertain onion sites and exploring anything like that. Alright done with this one.



*Ddos attacks* : i ddos my neighbors i admit this one proudly not an act of being an asshole or anything but the story is ; my neighbors have 3 wifis and our area is only allowed to have 7 wifis but the dumb 3 member family next to me have 3. I talked to them about it and explained why it's bad having more than one wifi close but they almost beat me up and started saying some weird slurs i never heard before (I'm white btw. Saying stuff like slut-boy and fuck-boy in Tunisian. I will let you have your fun guessing it)
So yeah they have been toxic about it so i had to do what's gotta be done
Trying as hard as possible to make them remove at least one so i can have a wifi because all the places are occupied and it wasn't until last year that i had the leagle right (under a parents id ofc) to file a demand for a wifi so that's that or at least that's what my parents told me. So yeah that's why i ddos my neighbors ofc i don't spoof or snoof on them that would be terrible



*Hacking the neighbor's wifi* : i don't have internet and k just explained why and second of them it's in the name handshake it's harmless (if i used smthn like brute force i would be arrested for sa lmao.)


*Crypto mining* : i work for a small game development studio as the boss (how cringe of a way to put it) as head leader developer (that's better) so i don't get much money we are sorta rich but my parents just don't buy me anything they need a report on anything i buy and ofc they wouldn't buy me digital stuff like games on steam or whatever so i need to make some other cash. And it's harmless they just have to pay for the electricity bill and complain each time it comes.










I think my apology was worst than travis Scott's but still ppl calling me an asshole and all over nothing bro. Like people already forgived reiko#3333
The most malicious online individual i could think of. Well he is most popular for his discord of t-slur harem (why would i even be caring about the t-slur it's Tunisia) where he recruted a lot of minors 11 - 17 years old and he would require a picture of theire thighs or a picture of their chest (any sus picture) and then telling them that if they don't have a girlfriend they can be the girlfriend someone else's girlfriend telling them to take hormone pills (you know wich hormone) and sending them the pills in a box with a maid dress or some cross dressing material and some times some sus toys and telling them to use those and taking a naked picture everyday and sending it to prove that they were taking the pills. Admitting he wouldn't stop until every minor on /r6k/ is a femboy or at least starts cross-dressing and people forgived him after being exposed he did a not so official apologie to someone on discord and the someone recorded it. So people just forgived him. But for me i still think that the t-slur harem is still recruiting and there are people still being blackmailed and doxxed by Reiko
To this day and people are worshipping Reiko to this date.

But reiko has done other stuff before he drove some minors to commit suicide after blackmail and cyber bullying them.

There are rumors that he traded cp but i am not sure.

He started this whole be the girlfriend thing ofc after having experience in doxxing and blackmailing.


Just wanted to point this out because people were calling me a psycho and the worst and everything but still this right here is the definition of a psycho online. He had done worst stuff then me he is Heisenberg of this shit and i am nothing but a Skyler in this entire rabbit hole of internet maliciousness.",,,,,,2022-08-29 02:17:49

never had this problem anywhere else but ways to find people who are welcoming and go out when you’re by yourself? I know there isn’t a go to answer, but I’m starting to hate it here cause I’m at a loss. Parents sorta isolated me early on and now I’m trying to form relationships at an older age. 

My sisters never had this problem cause they travelled back home a lot when they were teens 17-25 while I was still young and had houma friends in a random village. Now in the city and don’t know where to start(been coming for a year). Keep getting told to go out and talk to people, but I’ve usually had to know one person who introduced me to their group or already had a group. Not sure how to start from scratch again. Not close friends for obvious reasons but people who just go out and are welcoming. Tunis is very cliquey. Been impacting me mentally and I wanna get over this shit.",,,,,,2022-08-29 13:23:09

Edit : for ppl that don't know the trend and don't use Facebook and tiktok the trend is basically referencing that you went through the experience of being raped or sexually assaulted and the Medusa tattoo is used to reference that in the trend videos.
Usually the videos include vague details about the experience or the feelings associated with it.",,,,,,2022-08-30 02:38:53

You guys realize that there is no scientific backing for that theory, it's just some bullshit that those self development gurus spit out on YouTube to convince some vulnerable young men either that they're Alpha and that they deserve all the fame money and women they desire without trying to work on themselves, or that they're below that and they need to accept it and stop trying for the rest of their lives.

This is absolutely not true, this theory was proposed about apes and other wild animals and it has been debunked a long time ago.

You are not an alpha all the time or a beta or a sigma all the time, you are what you want yourself to be.

Some people have more charm and charisma than others I'll admit that, but that does not mean that they're better or worse than anybody else.

Stop put yourselves down for thinking you're below alpha and stop hyping your ego up thinking that you are an alpha just because you're good at talking to people.",,,,,,2022-08-30 09:57:29

There is a case where someone has mental illness and he might also cause a serious threat to the life of citizens, when i ask about the reason why these kind of ppls ain't getting health care or maybe taken to somewhere where they do whatever they must to keep them from causing danger to others, they tell me they got the red card, we even here in my small city we have 2 of these who both if them stabbed multiple peoples causing some of them serious injuries that led to death and they were always taken for couple days maybe 3 and then released again to walk among peoples like nothing happened and you still have nothing to do to them, they sleep on in the middle of the road in the crossings, they leave their waste here and there sometimes, they generally knows everyone but you have to do whatever they want like if they as for 1 dinar you just gotta give them otherwise you are getting into serious problems.

Tunisia

I love you but I hate you too

Many friends left you, many friends died in Italy

Others fled to Sweden, others are stuck in Germany

We were raised in poverty, yet on Tv we watched Mtv

We wanted to meet Britney Spears, we wanted to be free

Every pleasure was banned; every pleasure was haram

We felt exhausted, repressed, we wanted to go bahn dam

We played soccer barefoot, we fought we loved, we learned to hope

We were beaten; we made mistakes we learned to cope

We learned to respect the flag and to respect our president

Now we know we must respect the money and respect the government

The generation changed, the walls have been made taller

People are more afraid of each other

The corruption didn’t cease, most probably never will

Like the jungle: cutthroat mentality: kill or get killed

Beware my friends this country is hard and tough

If u get fucked here, it will be very rough

North Africa my Friend, People are considered intelligent

Yet most people struggle to pay the rent

Rich country and poor at the same time, confusing

Having or Being, Erich Fromm, a book worth musing

Let’s say the truth no more lies

No equality here, no fair game, do not fantasize

Many people are alive but dead inside

Trapped in many prisons, stuck in many troubles they can’t leave behind

Obsessed people, lost generation, a sad scene, gloom factors

Even the first tv channel shows only dead actors

We trapped in this prison born here we die here, we only love our mamas

Enjoy your freedom and don’t succumb to the drama",,,,,,2022-08-31 21:53:35

-Make weed legal and make it only sold by the government(new revenue stream/less money to spend on teenagers in prisons and more on serious crimes)

-Decriminalization of being lgbtq(not saying making lgbtq marriages legal or adoption ,I believe that it is an issue that can be argued for or against but I hate that the country's ressources are being wasted on catching lgbtq poeple)

-Take a loan from the chinese(or the IMF but the IMF has economic conditions that would limit tunisian economic direction)

-Reform Education(5 days of school instead of 6 and 4PM max instead of 6 PM,mandatory dress for both males and females,Teach history chronologically without neglecting any part of it ,make secondary subjects enjoyable for students,raise teachers's salaries,enforce both students and teachers's presence,teach religion only in primary school as an option,make the 1st lesson of the year in every subject an explanation on why the students are being taught that subject,make equal balance of opportunities between the sections)
-Make English the second language(but also make sure that there is equal opportunities in both French and English)

-More taxes

-Increase tourism in the non-coastal states of Tunisia also encourage guide based trips instead of the stay in the hotel for 7 days 

-Federalise 

-Increase trade with other non-eu countries(most notably South America towards Asia) and negotiate non visa permits for  tunisians

-Make a tunisian national identity embracing every part of our culture(arab,carthaganian,amazigh,vandal,ottoman etc)and thus decreasing the chances of people wanting to go abroad

-Hope that the people seeing change start voting more and become less pessimistic/toxic when talking about the country",,,,,,2022-08-31 23:15:06

I do have some bright friends that didn't do too well on the bac exam and therefore couldn't get into their ""prepa/prepa intégré"" of choice in order to pursue an engineering degree.

Hassilou, what I'm trying to point out is how unfair this can be. Having to go through the ""prepa"" phase, and having to bear everything that comes with it, be it stress, anxiety, depression or the butt load of other emotions, just for someone else to pay to get an easier path and get the same engineering degree that one has to work so hard for, is completely unfair.

I'm not saying students in private unis don't work for their degrees or that they straight up ""buy em"". I'm just saying that they do work for em. Just not nearly as hard as those in public unis.

The reason why I do find this to be a problem is because the job market is being flooded with people with degrees (that in some cases don't deserve at all).",,,,,,2022-09-01 22:26:51

I was reading the daily newspaper Al Chourouk. What do I find on page number 4 in the middle? This title: A Tunisian invents a Motor without energy. There is a picture of the so called inventor. Next to it this article: The tunisian inventor Mohamed Abbassi has been able to invent an electrical motor that works without energy when he was only 30 years old. This invention could make Tunisia the biggest producer of energy in just 5 years and help it get rid of its debts, so he says. Knowing that the production of energy could reach 100 times what the STEG( Tunisian Society for Electricity and Gaz) is producing right now. Mohamed Abbassi is now 61 years old and he is an autodidact from Sfax. He has been fond of mechanics and electricity since the tender age of 11 years old and he made a car start with water when he was 17 years old. And he has other inventions in the aerodynamics field. Mohamed Abbassi hopes that the goverment and businessmen would listen to him and take interest in his project and fund him to help the people and the country.

I checked with the Tunisian customs website( https://www.douane.gov.tn )it says if it’s a gift it’s permitted.
What are the parameters on which they consider it as a gift?😅
I had been to many countries and aware how customs officers are at the airport they assume everything as commercial purpose and it’s quite hard to convince them.
Irony is that it would be brought as gift but the customs officer will decide after entering Tunis airport.
That day if customs are not in a good mood and make up their mind to not consider it as the gift I’ll have to pay huge taxes.

Since i was a child I had that terrible feeling hunting me and chasing me around. I remember i was only 7, when i kept telling my father that i have that gut feeling that something awful is about to happen . I had that big ball in my throat that's making it hard for me to breath ..
The bitter sensation you get when you are holding back tears  . Whenever i laugh i just find myself washing it off quickly because i felt like i didn't deserve it. 
That's how I've always known myself.
As i grew older my dark shadows never left. They're heavier,darker,stronger now i never had dreams , ambitions or allowed myself to let others in  because i knew i am not staying . I didn't want no strings attached to that world. I tried praying ..cried and begged  god to help me . But i was on my own. I was so confused as a child and didn't even have the words to describe it .
I decided then that i have to let go. I contemplated suicide very often and i even  went for it twice . 
It obviously didn't work for me . But i remember vividly the fantasy of dying  that  never left me . 
Depression often comes with so many companions... Anxiety.. eating disorders..body dysmorphia... Insomnia
And lucky enough i believe i had the whole package.
I hated to way i look i have always felt ugly and fat ... I would binge eat whenever i am sad then feel disgusted by myself and i the little self control i had then i would puke all of it.
At some point i lost the ability of feeling hungry i would just eat-puke-repeat or i would just eat nothing at all for days.. i believe that lasted 2 constitutive years .
Sleeping was a real issue... sometimes I wouldn't sleep for days till i start hallucinating and passing out for seconds... An whenever i do i get sleep paralysis and iwould wake up freaked out. 
At night time my brain would be on fire.. all the narrators in my head would be simultaneously speaking asking questions and be trying to keep up with all of em... It was exhausting.
I never went to a psychiatrist or got diagnosed because i hated myself enough to not reach out for help and when i did my parents asked me to self medicate or pray. 
That was my life till i am 23 ...
At 23 everything changed i simply completely dissociated... Convinced myself that i can ""analive""  myself anytime i want and that i will eventually do it.
And now I don't feel anything 
It's like i am not alive anymore and my conciseness is sitting there in the corner watching the character that used to be ME ""living"".
Now i be would having sleep paralysis but not be scared or even react.. i would just watch it happen and i wait for it to end 
I simply am aware now that my brain is playing games .. and the games aren't working anymore.

The voices in my head faded away on by one .. none is asking questions anymore. i simply don't care about my personal development no more  I am not curious about anything... 

I don't know who is this but i know i am gone. 
I am not sad or happy i am totally numb and i pretend whatever feeling i wanna show . I wear so many social masks and make reckless irresponsible decisions.
Hang out with ppl that i would have never been around. 
And i am just standing there and watching like if i am waiting for my clock to stop and i would go and everything would never be remembered.

I find myself now missing my depression, my voices... the uniqueness of the personality that came with it. The realness of life that came with it. I find myself wishing that i actually kil*ed myself when i had the chance instead of just letting her fade away like that.",,,,,,2022-09-06 03:53:02

It has much better weather than Tunis, raining ~650mm per year vs ~450mm in Tunis. 

In the summer the weather is way cooler especially with the much stronger sea breeze coming from the Northwest (France).

It has a lot industrial infrastructure, including a big port and military airbase.

The only oil refinery in Tunisia.

Better agricultural potential than Tunis.

Great natural sites, such as forests, a UNESCO reserve (Lac Ichkeul which is the biggest natural freshwater lake in North Africa) and the possibility for eco-tourism.

Yet, after all of this, it’s only the 7th biggest city in the whole country.

x7f7ea,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/x7f7ea/can_someone_help_me_translate_a_short_text_into/,1,Can someone help me translate a short text into Tunisian Arabic?,"Me and my friend are attempting to create a comparative catalogue of languages, normally when you go onto Wikipedia or glosbe for a language sample text you get an almost robotic read of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we are hoping to provide a better alternative to that by collecting interpretive translations for a surrealist text, to provide beginners a better feel of a language sample. Ideally we need both a native and a Latin script.

The text is as this:

\-------------

I am the singing lamb

I bite

In the house of the elect

The green dog.

Catch me or

I will escape

I don't need you but

Don't leave me.

As good as a turkey

At singing

Like a rat

Always hidden.

All my accomplishments are

The work of others

I speak six languages

All half-assed.

I am the prince of the west

With many servants,

I bring a thousand gifts

I don't know why!

Deaf to good reasons

I'm going to perish,

At least I'm the fastest

Among the fools.

\-------------

Interpretative translation is encouraged instead of literal, for example there is this line in the English version ""as good as a turkey at singing"" which compares bad singing to the noise made by a turkey bird, if your language for example compares bad singing to something other than a turkey I encourage you to use that translation instead (in Dutch a crow is used e.g.) or when it says ""deaf to good reasons"" most languages have a specific way to express deliberately ignoring good advice.

Some context to the text:

The first verse is a character introducing himself as the singing lamb, this is a literal singing lamb because it is a surrealist song text, he bites another character - the green dog (also literal) - in the house of an elected official (presumably a mayor).

In the second paragraph a new unnamed character is speaking, each paragraph then has a new speaker.

The next time a character introduces himself is in the 5th paragraph with the prince of the west. It is doubtful this character is an actual prince but it is open to interpretation by the listener. In the final paragraph another unnamed character is saying he is deliberately ignoring advice he knows to be good which will lead to his demise, he then proclaims that at the very least he will be the fastest among the fools (people who deliberately ignore good advice).",,,,,,2022-09-06 16:39:23

So long story short I have been taking care of some kittens that live in the garden of an empty house for the past three weeks. But the house's owner (who doesn't currently live in that house) decided to kick the kittens out. I can't let stay on the street beacuse they are so young that they won't survive. I can not take them into my house either because we have a dog. 

Sow where can I put those kittens ? Does somebody know any refuge that takes animals in ? Or any other place where they would have a chance of surviving ? Or someone who wants to adopt kittens ? 

They just need to be taken care for some weeks the time that they grow up enaugh to survive on their own.

I have been searching and thinking for days but couldn't find anywhere to put. And this is pretty urgent because the day after tomorrow I am gonna be going back to friends.

Things started to change 4 years ago , when i started to sleep less without feeling tired , i became more sociable ( used to be a die hard introvert)  and i started to feel more energetic. I was euphoric and happy for most of the time for no apparent reason. 
Back at the time i thought i somehow managed to ""upgrade"" myself  and become the ""super human"" thay i am right now.
No one could keep up with energy . No partner or friend.
Fasr forward 4 years , i started some things are off
I was active sexually and my sexual behavior was becoming wreckles to the point i slept with 3 different strangers in two days
 I  was losing my stuff all the time and getting distracteed way too easily
Thats when i decided to seek help
Turns out nothing was super about me , it was just having manic episodes.

Tunisia is an average country in almost everything. If you speak about corruption and stuff like that then I have to tell you look at Haiti or Mexico. Even countries like India and Pakistan are worse. 

If you say ""criminality"" I tell you be happy that you are not aware of the amount of atrocities taking place in the world. There are websites which I won't even tell you about but if you would ever visit them and see how ugly the world is you would be very thankful that you live in Tunisia.

If you talk about the standard of life then I tell you be happy that you live in Tunisia because you ain't stupid and think that welfare comes without cost. In most developed countries people living there are empty souls; more or less bodies only. In Japan you hardly can notice the difference between people and robots. 

So be happy that you live in Tunisia and may God protect Tunisia. There is definitely a lot to develop and to make better but until then we're (one of the) best.

i finally managed to get an average gaming pc mid summer but my parents will cry and will try to ruin my free time (they already did even in the summer)

blah blah ""3am 9raya""

i hate this school system like most people, i'm not a bad student, rather decent i would say but i have hated school for many years already and that's with pretty minimal work in my free time (this is also because i didn't have a remotely decent pc/laptop before, i've always felt like my free time was wasted, aka i didn't have a way to relieve the stress from school so i most definitely wouldn't want to spend it studying)

like i just want to zoom through this ""last"" year but my usual behavior (minimal work in free time) probably will be detrimental to my plan of leaving the country eventually

&amp;#x200B;

PS i think the fact the BAC can include any lesson from the whole year is pretty pointless, call me stupid, we should at least be told which ""set"" (not all but a bunch) of lessons could come or maybe the opposite by telling us about a few lessons that aren't included, instead of just ***relearning*** all the worthless lessons from the whole year",,,,,,2022-09-13 20:01:48

The more a state digresses towards religion or ethnicity the less functioning the democracy becomes. We can see in America the failure of multiculturalism and the exceedingly toxic political sphere of immigrant accepting countries. In Tunisia for the reason that we don't have a strong sense of national identity we are doomed especially in a world where national identity is harder and harder to cling to even for westerners who are lucky to not need it as much.
In conclusion democracy will never function for us as long as we do not perceive ourselves as a nation, a civilization, a culture and a state and not as a part of any of them.

social media just to make friends from all around
the world (not sure whether to start with instagram,
twitter or reddit). After graduating from high school
in late 2019, I relocated to pursue
my higher education. As a result, I literally lost most,
if not all, of my friends. I didn't give up and tried to
get new ones in university, but then Covid came
along and we started having online classes
(which didn't help), the majority of my classmates
are avoidants for whatever reason and have their
own world. I'm feeling lonely, with basically no one
to talk to, outside my family members. The last time
I spoke to someone my age was a couple of months
ago, and it was about a project assigned to us
by our professor. I'm hesitant because contacting
strangers online seems weird, especially if you
try to slide into their DMs, or comment on their
photos while I don't even know them. I tried an app
called ""Slowly"" where you can exchange virtual
letters with penpals, but didn't go well since most of people I stumbled upon abandoned the platform.

Anyway, I really would like to make international friends but I have no clue how, where, and what should I do exactly ?! Do you have any personal experiences in this? 

All your comments and suggestions are highly
appreciated :)) .",,,,,,2022-09-14 14:28:40

\- Every job offer asks for 2 to 3 years of exp

\- I swear I didn't come across a single job asking for fresh graduates in the last 6 months of my search.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Every job offers expect you to know 7 billion programming languages and frameworks and to have done projects.

\- How Am I supposed to be know how to use kubernetes ? in my mom's basement startup ? How am I supposed to know these programs that are meant for big scale projects ?

&amp;#x200B;

\- Every job offer expects you to be fluent in French, English, chinese and hieroglyphs.

\- Have you ever heard of Google Translate mf ?!

&amp;#x200B;

\- Every job offer asks for a good interpersonal skills and team spirit .

\- Bitch, I got into computer science because I'm introvert as f and never leave home and you think I'm willing to work with a team ?

&amp;#x200B;

\- Every application has to go through bullshit formalities like a motivation letter, short and long term goals, etc...

\- I don't have plans for long term, and any one who has is delusional. Have you ever heard of future discounting motherfucker ? I'd like you to read your long term goals you set in 2018 thinking that the world will go according to your plans, were you able to take into account Covid at that time ? I personally genuinely can't, for the life of me, set long term goals, cause you just can't, there are many factors, that you can't predict, any engineer who has ever studied physics knows that predicting the future is super hard, you barely can predict experiment result in an isolated lab with 2 factor like gravity and time.

&amp;#x200B;

and most importantly WHY DONT THEY RESPOND WITH A CLEAR REJECTION. WHY DO I NEED TO KEEP GUESSING IF THEY ARE GONNA CALL ME OR NOT FOR THE NEXT 2 WEEKS !

&amp;#x200B;

I have it in mind already. Not the full scenario but how it would eventually look like. The mountains, the villages, the people, the weddings, just everything. I have it in mind just the way Michael Jacksson used to have his songs in mind before he even write them. That is called talent btw. 

Anyway, I am so bad at the actual making of the game and after some Googling I am afraid it will never be profitable considering that some good games might cost as much as 50 million dollars to design 😱

First I added an Email and password verification.

The email has to follow user@domain.ext
And the password has to be at least 6 characters and contain both lower and uppercase. 

I also fixed a bug where secrets aren't shown. (it was an error on my part 😅)

If you have any more feedback I'd appreciate it.

These new laws are genuinely horrifying, the post may have talked about cracked software but the new laws are pretty much destroying the concept of private life online. Anything you say or do online is saved for 2 years minimum by ISPs (and thanks to the new laws, they're legally required to do so) and the police agencies have the legal right to use this data against you. So any illegal activity you may do and post about or talk about with anyone you know online, can and probably will be used against you. Also there is a law in the text which is pretty much gonna prohibit the publication of police brutality.

"" They were rented to families of gaunt hollow-eyed and darkskinned people , not Mellungeons and not exactly anything else, who reproduced with such frightening prolificness that their entire lives appeared devoted to the production of the ragged line of scions who shoeless and tattered sat for hours at a time on the porch edges, themselves not unlike the victims of some terrible disaster, and stared out across the blighted land with expressions of neither hope nor wonder nor despair. They came and went, unencumbered as migratory birds, each succeeding family a replica of the one before and only the names on the mailboxes altered, the new ones lettered crudely in above a rack of paint smears that obliterated the former occupants back into the anonymity from which they sprang."" 

 Like I said, I come from Tunisia  and when I read this I felt like he was describing people of my country. Most youth here spend the whole day standing near the walls watching and observing and staring because of joblessness and boredom. People are struggling and seem to have no idea of purpose or meaning.

I heard even there is Tunisians who have sex only when the light is off , also do you guys think Tunisians accept or practice oral sex ( for exemple blowjobs or eating the girl down do girls or guys accept such practices ? )

He goes to the gym and orders food delivery to home not because of health reasons or actually because he doesn't have time but because people in the West do it lol

Here's an article:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/09/19/united-states-tunisia-democracy/

I'm a Chicagoan (who will be coming to Tunisia in June :) - can't wait!), and I don't have adequate background in Tunisian politics to have an opinion about this. All I can say, from an American perspective, is that US ""checks and balances"" - and electoral systems, and civil political discourse, and evidence based decision making, among other things - failed pretty miserably under Trump, so maybe the US should worry a little more about their own decaying political system. 

But I'm curious to hear some Tunisians' perspectives. Thanks!",,,,,,2022-09-21 12:45:38

BISMILLAH  
   
Wednesday the 21 th of september 2022  
\-This is an essay ,  
 \-a confession ,  
 \-a quest for urgent emotional support ,  
 \-a recitation of a dramatic childhood burdened with late night gruesome beating and a life in a poor village of   
قُرًى الساحل التونسي الناتن   
\-A paper that describes the holiness of the adolescence crisis and its devastating impact  on relations with opposite gender , stories that haunted my supposed 8 hours of night sleep   
\-I couragely  decided  to write the truth about my 10 years of brain-devasting time  
 spent roughly in a college that gave me after begging a diploma that continuously ruins my life ,   
\-this is a tale of a social revolution ‘s destructive events  ,   
\-a truly honest picture of a one year experience among the “ghorba “ dommar , events that almost catched my breath   
\-and eventually a complete and honest depiction

Of my addiction  situation …  
\-1:  so to start :   
To me : the best thing is to write , to shout , to yell , to say that your problems are real and not that just :   
يفرجها ربي   
Yeah but no , i mean i suffer , i suffocate , dear Almighty have mercy upon me   
To me also : the worst thing is to lose a part of your beloved diary , your ancient  essays , it just gone by the wind , without you noticing it got burned with flames , your papers lost and gone away in   
بلاد العكري   
\*\* ok now may I start this document , thanks for reading respect and love towards your interest in my suffering :   
\*Part one :   
Hey , i was successfully but not asked for BORN in the late 80s  ,   
an epoque of great mouvements , an era of hope and uncertainty ;   
   
God bless my mother and all yours told me that where i was born the hospital ward was infested with cockroaches ,   
i think one of them was smart enough to enter my little developing brain and cruse it deeply that i became an insane , addict , social failure , black hearted   
(قلب أكحل )   
And indifferent   
(ترما أبرد من فريغو )   
Shout out to my infesting little pet …  
So as to say , the first memory of my life was this : i was about 5 years old and it's most likely the year 1993 ,   
The image i remember : we were till now HAMDOULAH a happy group of people with different ages and conceptions living a middle class neighborhood in a village of east coastal tunisia   
(الساحل التونسي )   
This is a family , and may Almighty bless and conserve yours   
We had like a classic house , the type they call   
دار عربي   
It was and still after 3 decades cosey and lovely ….  
So i remember in our yard me and my brother ( shout out bro) bought a plastic soccer ball from one of the oldest stores in town  , the big Nacer GH a pioneer of our little city in the 90’s , may he RIP   
We brought the ball , entered happily our household , but my beloved grand Pa ( father of my PA) was sitting in a corner sipping concentrated RED tea   
التاي ، شاي أحمر تع المرمجيا    
I think that trash is like meth or crack to them old folks lol   
And he was smoking MARS legères , the famous , plus was enjoying some classic arabic music singing throughout the broken radio ..  
We didn't give a damn about grand PA ( may he RIP i still miss him he was a honest man among filthy people …)  
We went crazy AF , kicking the ball harder than Pele towards the wall and shouting crazy like typical middle class tunisian children ….  
Then sadly my memory starts to blaze and I don't recall what happened next OMG  this is  my cockroach pal  did ate that part from my SD card … oh no :’(   
So i dont keep you longer , apparently what happened next was that grand PA got so upset and took our ball and yelled at as ,   
As you can see its a story without meaning or   
عبرة   
But i will ALWAYS be proud that i did remember my first life scenario that is hamdoulah stuck in my vision ,   
I hope you all conserve those first memories of your beautiful childhood …  
\-part 2 : the second event i remember was that ( no body is perfect , i am squeezing my memory part of the brain to try remember that pop song of 1996 that we used to sing ) while playing in a little so called forest in our neighborhood , like i said we lived in a village not that urbanic ,   
So we were climbing trees singing jumping and stealing Almond   
(اللوز )   
We were three happy and back then caring about each other , neighbors and pals ,   
Sadly all that friendship went flying into air for those who got married , those who immigrated , those who became rich , and those who become a proud and honest addict ,   
Those little scams and troubling we did in the hood are still present in my mind , and everytime i happen to remember em i just burst in the last tears that were left on me ,   
But ok , that's life , nothing is permanent , see patriarch Noah…   
\-Part 3 folks then i will spare you my sickness memories :   
It was about 1997 or so , i had an  uncle ( i still don't like it , he is the type of “SFAXIEN “ life style and thinking \[ no offense and big shout out \]   
So this asswipe convinced my little brain to go with him in a swim with his kids who were also my pals ,   
I knew something wasn't' right but i couldn't resist   
So we hop up into his car that his government institution gave him , it was and old Renauld bull crap vehicle ,   
So we arrive at time at one of the most beautiful beach and sea in Green Tunisia , you might guess ..  
The douche was swimming with his kids , its his right , he didnt care bout my ass and didnt even talked to me , why the fuck you brought me  here asshole ? i could have been playing soccer in the hood   
(بطحة الحومة )   
Or watching saturday’s   
ايقاعات عالمية على قناة 21   
\-okeydoke  ,  I left them happily swimming next to the beach and I entered the sea alone to see what it was like ..  
Beware of whats gon happen ,   
I realised that my feets werent touching the sea ground properly , it was my first attempt to learn to swim , i d be a proud “ SAHLI” but fuck i coudnt do it , so i started to drown , and didnt even had the force to cry for help , and the stupid beach didnt have security punkass guard ,   
I knew it , i was gonna die young , 9 years old maybe , so accepting this fate i started to wave and use my hands to stay on top of the water , it lasted bout couple minutes then my hands gave up so i sadly drowned for a couple of seconds and that FILM of your life cassette  started to roll in my mind , but some grateful guy came out of the blue and holded me up , i was mid unconscious  , so sorry i dont remember the details but i was taken back to the beach and rescued in an “ artisanal” way …  
The douche uncle was happy i was still alive and drove us  back home while i was obnubilated ..   
عمر جديد تكتبلي حمدلله    
When i got home i walked straight to my beloved room , my baby room that kept all my secrets inside its walls , and i started to cry , since i ‘v conceived that what happened was the first shock of real life :   
Life doesn't ‘ hold you like a baby ,  
 life is a silent killer ,   
it gave me mental resistant illness(’es!) ,   
i failed college ,  
 i destroyed many lovely relationships,   
i overdosed , i cried in them dark long nights of rainy winter ,  
 i suffered long term virginty and spent millions dinard in drugs and alcohol in order to forget the awefull pain  ,  
 i made my mother proud and then hopeless ,  
 i remember my poor father crying like a baby when he catched my big brother doing his first cigarette ,   
i hamdoullah got graduated , worked my ass hard in my field , i helped and served hundred of people and i do love all people , i no envy no one , i swear Almighty , i have a good heart , but one day i did a suicide attempt that failed but gave me real sequels , but i learned that , after all these years of suffering , problems , abusing , hard work that the most important thing is   
to FIGHT TO STAY ALIVE ….   
Thanks ,   
Sorry for being that emotional i just wanted to share and maybe help or inspire  others with same issues   
\-i certainly will continue the tale if y’all kindly approve and i have time …  
\-farewell :)))",,,,,,2022-09-21 19:53:14

A couple of months ago, I went out with a girl I'd been chatting with on Facebook for months. We have been talking on the phone and texting but we could not go out because we were never available at the same time. During summer vacations, when both of us were free, we finally went out and I thought we had a great time. We talked nonstop for 2 hours about different subjects, joked around and I liked her company. Guess what? I got ghosted by her. She no longer picks up on the phone and never replied to my texts. I kept thinking about what I doing wrong: we both talked, I asked her about herself, talked about myself, talked about topics that interested her and we had some things in common, I was kind and I made her laugh... I would not be surprised if she did that because I told her that I don't have a car and I don't drive my father's.

Also a while ago, I and some friends from university went out. One of them was a girl and we were the first to arrive since our other friends were a bit late we sat alone in the coffee house for half an hour and the tension was so awkward... while I was trying to break the ice and talk, she just answered and then stayed silent. No effort to keep up the conversation. We got along fair enough back in university and we were not best friends or anything but come on...

Another girl stood me up before even meeting after we agreed on Facebook that we will meet after work for coffee.

Seriously, I wonder how guys get their girlfriends. Most of my friends are single, except for the la7asa's (lol) and the tall handsome ones. I get the feeling that people here are so insecure since it's not safe out there in Tunisia. Or maybe the girls have so many options thanks to Instagram and Facebook and people calling them out on 'Spotted' groups on Facebook, that they decide to not get interested in the guy the minute they see he is missing something.

For years, I've been focusing on my career. I also work out and I believe I'm fit enough to attract some women and I also have lots of hobbies ... I'm confident in myself and people generally like my company since I'm fun and respectful so I really can't figure it out.

Maybe I was having too much faith and refused to believe that most women are superficial and Tunisians are not an exception. Maybe having a car gets you from being a 6/10 to a 9/10?",,,,,,2022-09-22 11:21:45

His life revolves around Tunisia. Tunisia and its politics are in other words more important to him than his private life 

He still believes that democracy and the state of law are possible with a population like that. Nothing wrong with the people btw but it is just completely incompatible with democracy

He thinks that sitting and theorising about democracy and state of law behind a computer is the same thing as in reality 

He find it weird that people don't agree with him totally ignoring that people don't even listen to their creator 

He nags about democracy and diversity but applies nothing of it in his private and professional life

He is between 17 and 25 and lives in La Marsa or Lac 

Most of his life revolves around either developing, coding and crypto or high school and its childish problems 

A typical problem fot him is parents who don't get along or a mother who used in her sallad the avocado he bought for his face mask 

It is important for him that Reddit isn't Facebook or Twitter or anything else. He wants to feel special as a Reddit user 

He is as easily offended, sensitive and fragile a Aysha Attia. He can't (under)stand that other people have different opinions 

He has a very weird sense of humor that only he and other reddit users understand

أعوذ بالله من شر ما ريت ، أعوذ بالله من الشيطان الرجيم   
Allah soit loué !   
It was just a dream   
I just woke up ,   
right hand  to God   
from a gruesome nightmare ( i’m used to those) ,   
With my belly still aching and fast-heart beating as my perception emerges from a dramatic and loud vivid dream about a war scene   
… guess i was shot or stabbed or blast   
I suppose that's  how I am dead in there and awake in here …  
Thank god it was just a dream   
But why the brutality   
Its its its ? \[ trying hopelessly to catch what part of the awful night it is\] …  
 yea Dawn ( Sobwh) prayer time , deducing so , since I heard my father leaving our home to Sobh prayer and  my lasy pet-cat woken up by  adhan call  ( call to prayer ) to ask for his “first '' breakfast ….  
 But what the fuck i’m doing grasping my computuer while i’m ( the intention to try to to lie upon or make up something like this is an obscene act that  *was never raised to be part of or  accepted to do ) still in a mental agony and physical disturbance …*   
*Reader ‘s awareness that what follows is just what nothing but the truth must be kindly privileged , before everything starts to emerge and then gets judged  by different types of adjectives . Period*   
*-General context : OP is -as ancient and  special as you - redditor since the community was founded ,*   
*i ' m proud to have had (before ) an account with 9 years ago Cake day  , lost access to it due a social media -accident*   
*-But the sad and scary part of it is that it  consists mostly of NSFW real content ( no crime thanks to  ALmitghy ) but scenes of what my life evolves around : death , morbidity , continouess mental ilness ; suicide thoughts and substance abuse , a discription of long term undergraduated studies among university ,*   
*a questionable  spiritual thoughts ,*   
*a gruesome description of a  devastating field of sanitarian work ‘ diaries ,*  
 *tales of multiple broken heart enigmas , sociopathy , separation ,*   
*negative effects of 21th c globalization among the third world ,*   
*pictures of   immigration and graphic portrait of ghorba ( the state of living in western europe in my case )*   
*and ofc recitation of a Tunisian youth ‘s hopeless decay after a modern revolution ,*   
*Now its almost 5 am of still dark morning of september the 24 th of this same year :*   
*Thats right you guessed quickly ,*   
*This a present talk*   
*Sorry to have to write what the nightmare was about sooner in order to catch details from fading : ok this has to be the most important part ….*   
*At it happens : i woke up in a cloudy day , certain , with people shouting , screaming and yelling ,*  
 *no laughts or sleep sounds were heard :*    
*so its about a group of people unified by something or some circursomestances ,*   
*as i look around a deduce that it was a scene of an illegal embarkation accident  ( Har9a)  and a military convo / deployment , somewhere in shore ,*   
*a mixed scene from a documentary about Italian ONG’s rescuing an Africain failed disembarkation and the famous Omaha beach scene from the movie Saving private Ryan …*   
*Weird and makes no sense like all nightmares/ dreams ..*  
*The events were short but i do recall :*   
*-some firearms were shooting at and hitting us , i was blood , people running , the air smelt metal , flesh and pee ( i damn know those last 2) ,*   
*-some guy ran to me speaking common arabic and shouting that they were burning our passeports ?*   
*-Who were we then ? : obvious : the immigrants , im and afro-arab …*  
*- Who were them : no clue …*   
*3rd scene mad me trippy scared and dizzy : i was at the same time holding a machine gun like one from call of duty alterery and  felt torturing pain from above then*   
 *saw flesh mixed with blood making way out of my vest holes …..*   
*-It was clear that the scenario was a war scene , first experience for me virtually and probably irl , at least at this extinct …*  
*Who was I ? Where are we ? and what in the hell was going on ????*   
*-The pain was so vivid that it ended with me waking up this saturday dawn …*  
*-nothing special about this story since we do all know how nightmares works , so i'm not upvoting nothing on it ,*   
*-on the other hand what did disturb me is that is a continuous occurrence to me recently :*   
 *i’m in an unwanted situation of chronic parasomnia , sleep and behavioral disorders , financial and relational breakdowns , drug-recovering , edging my mental illness , questioning my religious practices and especially my unwanted popping-off writings disturbing internet clerks …*   
*-As I regain reality , i decide to honest write this down failing to stay not-emotional as i intented ,*   
*-as said before , the current place is :*    
*a  rural village in central tunisia , with typical dawn Rooster shouts ( the animal Cock sound ) ..*  


*-Then i exited my room , 15 min afterwards  , put the coffee machine on and gou-out  our family house (beloved like yours ) in quest for cigarettes from a open shop and maybe some spiritual atmospheric reconciliation next to Mosques and Honest Believers ,*   
*I do sadly instead cross another poor dead little cat in fractured streets of our destroyed Tunisia …*  
*It made me remember when I was rushing to work in rainy Dawns of the second deadly wave period of The Covid Pandemic 2 years ago in northern France ,*   
*Dawn was way different  , rain and cold were a must , and people were  hurring mostly by obligation to their hard working - vital positions as obliged by the feets of unjust gigantastic ruthless father “Capitalista” worried about a chinese virus …*   
*\[ needless to say : I ‘m no body special , i dont blame history , family ,  national nor foreigner gouvernements , neither society of all ages nor the brave revolution , i’m one responsible individual accounted for his personal life choices and deeds  “*   
*End of story*   
*TLDR ; not an interesting morning essay  about typical personnel issues and never ending global dilemmas .*  
*Have a nice week-end*

i mean i had the idea of leaving the country multiple times because both my sisters already left to france for good but people leave  to make money and have a better life, well i am making a little money and i love my life here, my friends my family, even tho half my friends are leaving or already left to france,

I dont know if i really should try harder and try to get a job even tho it's really hard for chemical engineers, or should i go to france to study M2.

life is not that bad in Tunisia, Sousse. I enjoy gaming and i have a full setup gaming PC/ PS5, i enjoy going to the gym, i enjoy going to coffe shops and to the mall and to the beach etc.. so what else could i experience if i went to france/canada ?? 

is it really worth it to live alone and start from 0 ???is it really heaven out there ?

alot of my friends say that you cant live here with a 3 to 4k a month and start a family, and that i will struggle etc..and at the same time i dont want to leave my parents alone in here.

i am really struggeling to make a decision, i just want to know if it's really heaven out there ? is Tunisia THAT BAD ? i mean we grew up here and we turned out fine.

everyone and their mother left the country, what's the obsession about ?? makes me wonder if someday i am going to regret missing a chance or not trying hard enough..

sorry if my ideas are all over the place..

He is aware that to change the world you need to start with your inner world. Weird that there those who still don't get such a self evident truth as this.

He understands the game rules and his only mission in life is to get others to understand them. All he needs is to find a way.

He believes in steps and in the fact that things take time and that every thousand-step journey actually started with one step.

Time to say the truth

You need to tell things they way they are

Our country is not as bad as they say

Life can be awesome here. Life is awesome here. This is our country. We were born here. Our grandfathers and our grandmothers lived here. This is a superb country. One of the greatest countries on this planet. Our location alone is so unique and special. North Africa and along the middeteranian sea. Tunisians are raw and smart. They belong to the most intelligent people on this earth. Tunisians are “bon vivants”: They enjoy life and want to enjoy life to the fullest.

There is poverty here? There is poverty everywhere on this planet. No one can change that. People are unsatisfied? They can change their state of mind if they rethink carefully and consider their options and potential. It is time for us Tunisians to regain faith in our country and to be more than proud of our history, heritage and present and to look forward to building a more positive future. For the sake of our kids and future generations and for the sake of humanity in general. 

Like everywhere on this planet we have some bad apples. Let us not let these few dictate the music to which the whole country should dance. There is enough money, resources, wealth and richness in Tunisia that each person could live in dignity and with no fear of hunger or desperation.  We should start spreading this message more and more. People need to change the narrative of “ lets get the f out of here “ . No. We need to stay here and make it better. We need to fight and not escape. We need to face the enemy and not surrender. We need to give it a try at least. We owe to ourselves. And we owe it to our ancestors and we owe it to our kids and future generations. We can make our heaven here. There is enough room for all of us to live each like he wants. Lets pay our taxes. Lets make our state stronger. Let us start to love each other. Let’s stop the hating and the envy and all the negativity. Someone is making tons of money? Good for him! Let’s try to do like him. Some girl is dressing like Kylie Jenner? Well it is her choice and no need to dwell on it and move on and do something good for your life and for your society! Be smart. Find a way to be yourself and to find your satisfaction. We need to learn how to be happy and satisfied again. We had some hard times I admit but this gotta end now.

I was born in 1985. When I went to high school in Sousse the director made it his personal business that I keep my hair cut short. I wanted to have longer hair like Curt Cobain but it was forbidden by the law of the ministry of education, or so the director said. When I look at it back now I realize I was lost during nearly all of my youth and twenties. My parents were working like workaholics and they thought I was okay because I was doing fine in school but I was not. So I had to learn everything on my own. The real things that matter in life. I had to go through a lot to finally learn what really matters and what doesn’t. What is good and what is lethal. 

I want you to smile now. The next interaction you have with any other person, whether it is the waiter in a café or the worker in the post office or the other driver you meet in traffic. Just smile to him or her. We need to each ourselves to smile a bit more. We need to be polite to each other and say nice things and mean them. 

If you have a job, help someone who doesn’t have a job. It is not a shame if you help a jobless person to pay for something. You don’t need to buy a lacoste shirt if it is too expensive for you. The greatest things in this life are free. A small walk on the beach. A nice conversation under a tree. A love moment on the street. Be nice to your wife is you have one. It doesn’t matter what other people say. Focus on yourself. Focus on your family. Spread love and positivity. Make yourself stronger every day. Eat healthy. Stay away from drugs. Read books. Continue to educate yourself. Explore. Enjoy.",,,,,,2022-09-29 12:13:46

xryuky,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/xryuky/my_trip_to_djerba/,1,My trip to Djerba,"&amp;#x200B;

I would like to share with you a trip I had made in the past to Djerba. Djerba is really a magical island. Well the thing is probably 15 years ago but the memory of it is still fresh in my mind. I took the Louage from Sousse to Djerba. Well I tell you it was a terrible experience. The road is so long I cannot believe no more when someone says that Tunisia is a small country. That road, that long road seemed to be endless. The Louage driver made a few stops here and there but all passengers became tired and fed-up, me the most. Once we went past Sfax the road became visibly more southern like. Scrublands and the desert seemed to send us welcoming signs. The palm trees became more frequent. We made a stop somewhere where we could have a snack or a drink. The Louage driver seemed to know the proprietor of the inn where we stopped and they had a conversation witch each other. It seemed to be rather some kind of economic transaction. The driver stops us deliberately there. Passengers spend money there. And the owner gives the driver his share because the driver could have stopped in any other place and those places were many along the road. So like everything in Tunisia, some petty business going on and the business partners imagine they are doing something big and special. I captured that transaction while many of the other passengers didn’t even notice. I sat on a chair and smoked a cigarette and suddenly a passenger starts a conversation with me as if he were an old acquaintance of mine.  The guy was middle aged man who seemed to enjoy talk and conversation just for the sake of it. He told me that he knew another passenger who was an old man. He told me that the old man visited Sousse once a month and took this very tiring trip upon himself because his daughter studies there and he wants to visit her and make sure she is okay. I looked at the old man. He looked frail and very tired, maybe even sick. The middle aged man added that he thought this is not okay and that the old man should stay at home. I agreed with him and then I guess we went back to the car to continue our suffering. The public transport system of Tunisia is a disaster and the roads are a deadly atrocity. I remember looking at the road and seeing the world turn yellower and redder and somehow things changing very much. The green seemed to disappear and it became a really southern atmosphere.  When we finally arrived in Djerba and took the ferry and landed there it did seem to be another country that had nothing to do with the main land. People seemed way laid back and nice and hospitable. And I remember seeing so many high quality good hotels everywhere. It seemed like some kind of hidden tourist paradise. I know money when I see it and it damn sure was a lot of money going on in that place. Busses and special convoy cars full of tourists. These tourists even looked wealthier than usual. I was just surprised that I didn’t know about all of that going on before I visited Djerba. It is a very peaceful island and it has its own charm and the weather was fantastic. I guess there is a reason for all that booming tourist business. Anyways I remember also during the way back on the ferry that there were 2 guys who started a conversation with me. It turned out they were from Libya. One of them said he worked in the petroleum business. He confessed that they came to Djerba to have some fun and then he went into the specifics and he seemed really eager and he thought I were some kind of pimp and that I could give him access to what he was looking for, he even insisted on having my phone number and that dude kept calling me for months after we met until he gave up and realized I was no pimp indeed. 

Well I shared with you some of my memories about that special trip I made in the past. I didn’t say why I went there because I prefer to keep that part private. But if u never were in Djerba and u can afford a visit I highly recommend it. It is really a well hidden secret and it is indeed much underestimated.",,,,,,2022-09-30 11:27:18

the card industrie is a monopole of rnta ( regie national des tabac et des allumetes ) so it's illegal to sell smugled card games because the 9badha add (droit de timbre ) on the card , in other word in every chkoba that you buy there is a stamp ( timbre) of 1d or more that goes to the dawla

this guy is selling his own card but the 7akem can give him a heavy fine for that

xts8jv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/xts8jv/thoughts_about_tunisia_2/,13,Thoughts about Tunisia 2,"  

What is going on in Tunisia? People complaining. Some don’t like this, others don’t like that. Moody’s decided to rate us negatively again. Economists are saying that the future is uncertain and things don´t look good at all. I read the newspaper today. News about youths being buried after having been found drowned trying to get to Europe. News about streets of the capital filled with the homeless. Even the football games haven’t started yet. Those teachers are on a strike. The other workers are planning a strike. It has become impossible for the middle class to even think of building a house. Divorce rates are on the surge. Dirt, plastic and rubbish all over the streets and in all places have become normality. I can’t deny that. That is indeed a truth. However let’s look at the other side of the picture: The weather is great. The air we breathe is refreshing and clear. Other people seem to be doing just fine. New Cars. Expensive cars. Dream cars. New extravagant villas being built. New projects being launched. Businesses booming and thriving. Money being made. Money flowing and circulating. That is also an undeniable truth. A fact. So how about we stop complaining and start working instead? How about we finally change ourselves because no one is going to fix our country for us. How about we stop throwing dirt and rubbish everywhere? How about we start behaving in a more civil and responsible matter? All of us. How about we learn all over again the true meaning of work? When we work, we must respect the time. We should give work its due importance and respect. We must work harder and believe in our country again and stop the self-loathing and self-defeating. I hear of parents selling their land and goods to afford to send their children to Europe. What do you think awaits them in Europe? A better future? A paradise? How about staying in Tunisia and making in it work here? If I had any authority I would make reading some books mandatory in school for all Tunisians. Like “To have or to be?” of Erich Fromm. I personally know a guy who makes good money yet he sends his 2 sons to Canada so that they make a better future for themselves. Or so he says. I rather think he wants just more. More money. Bigger house. Nicer car. More. More. Like that dude who went to Canada and came back wealthy and happy. Or that other dude who came back with a fortune too. That is an existing mentality here in Tunisia sadly. How about being humble and accepting the little? Now these 2 youngsters could easily spend up to 10 years in Canada. God knows the stress they will have to deal with and the numerous hardships they would encounter. 10 years without their family. Is it worth it? Has money become the all defining norm of success and happiness in our lives? Let us not let our society fall apart! We need to stop obsessing with greed and get our things in order and our priorities straightened out. No need for the madness and frenzy. Wake up Tunisians! We need to work. Hard work is required. Pride people! We need to get our pride back. And there is something else: It is called “Love”. Let’s admit it.  Most of us Tunisians don’t even know what that word means. Or we became so lost and confused along the labyrinth of life that we lost sense of it. Let’s start again.  Love our country. Keep it clean. Love each other. Have stronger family ties. Or else there would be no prosperity. We can do this. Let us help each other. No one is perfect. We all make mistakes. But a country is at stakes here. Let us all just try to spread more love and hope for the better.",,,,,,2022-10-02 15:56:54

i tried looking in linkedIn and tanitjobs but with no luck so far, feels the job market is saturated in tunisia and i'm not very picky about the job (applied for various fields bi/ds/back end dev ...).

got one employer that was interested in my profile and yet he never replied to my messages in linkedIn and tanitjobs is filled with jobs from months ago that are probably closed and no new jobs at all and all available one are asking for 5 years experience minimum.

i would appreciate your advices on where to look for jobs and how can i approach them in the field of computer science.

•It's like how both share the same vocabulary (kind of) but each one of the two has a different way of pronounciation, regardless of the fact that Tunisian is neither a language on itself nor standardized yet.

•Sfaxian seems to pronounce back **rounded** vowels more often compare to northern accent: *""ɑ""* is pronounced in sfaxian as **rounded** *""ɒ""*, compare words like ""th**a**3"", ""y9r**a**"" and ofc ""8**a**li"", in both accents.

•Sfaxian tends to have more diphthongs (a diphthong is a combination of two vowels into one single syllable as in ""C**oi**n"", ""H**ow**"", ""W**i**ne""..) compared to northern accents, as in ""Fin"" vs ""Feyn"" (i→ɛɪ) ""Huni"" vs ""Hawni"" (u→ʌʊ) ""Binek"" vs ""Beynek"" (i→ɛɪ).

We were die hard fans of Starwars while you admire Casa del papel   
We used to buy cassette tapes of Rai and Hard Rock in the morning Souk then go play barefoot soccer in Houma’s batha ( hood's pitch)   
before y’all grimmed us with stupid fancy artificial grass fields with parties (takwira)  costing us 5Dinars , what a shame …

I am not talking about those who just love their country and are proud of their tunisian civilization and rich culture across history.

I am referring to those who constantly make comments about them being ""better than europeans/non-muslims"" , and whenever they get asked why they only reply with things like ""a7na top rojla w lo5rin day\*\*th"".

&amp;#x200B;

This doesn't exclude the fact that white supremascists exist as well online and irl, but again, two wrongs don't make a right. And while white supremascists are being somewhat hated in most western societies, the ""fréret"" in tunisia are being widely accepted in TN.

My question is, where does this whole ""tunisian frère supremacy"" come from? Why do those tunisian people never provide with any good reason why they think they are ""the supreme beings on earth"", and just throw the ""top rojlé"" formula?",,,,,,2022-10-06 14:49:17

xxb7gp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/xxb7gp/thoughts_about_tunisia_3/,4,Thoughts about Tunisia 3,"  

If you ever meet a Tunisian who is not satisfied, who is angry or frustrated, who is not happy with the world nor with himself, who is always whining about how bad Tunisia is and who is always raving about how much he would like to get the hell out of here, just tell that person that maybe just maybe the problem doesn’t lie in Tunisia but in himself instead. 

The way I see it Tunisia has everything to offer a person may wish for. You just have to open your eyes and look for what you are searching for. I was reading a thread in an online forum the other day about some frustrated young Tunisian who was asking in all earnestness whether there were any happy people in Tunisia at all. I found a good answer. Someone replied to him that he was the same age and that he was happy and the reason for his happiness is called family. What a good attitude!

I am sitting here now in downtown sousse as I like to call it. Sousse is really getting bigger and bigger by the day. Sipping a coffee in a cosy clean place among some pretty happy looking faces in a nice atmosphere with not so loud rhythmic music in the background. If you find yourself in a downward spiral, in a bad zone, in a negative environment maybe you just need to change friends or move to another place but don’t put the blame on the whole country and generalize single bad events. 

Like the late great man John F Kennedy said “Do not ask what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country”. I know that there was another great thinker called  Bertolt Brecht who once said “ Erst Fressen dann die Moral” which could be translated in : “ First the food, after that the morality” but the way I see it most if not all the people leaving our country illegally towards Europe are not starving here either. There is a major problem in Tunisia similar to the problem faced by the black community in the United States. There is a collective void being built among the younger generation. There is a sense of cynicism, a sense of senselessness and nihilism that is threatening our younger sons and daughters. I went to the so called “house of youth” in Hammam Sousse and I had the unpleasant experience of hearing what some of the pupils of the adjacent school were saying in a conversation they were having in front of the entrance door. Some of the most vulgar language I ever heard in while pronounced so matter-of-factly and naturally by youngsters and young girls. Teenagers saying profanities and sexist words about their mothers and about intercourse and whatever. I was shocked to say the least. When I was their age that kind of behavior was absolutely not acceptable. So this kind of experiences leads me to surmise that there is sadly an ongoing decadence of values among our youths and that we must do what we can and all we can to stop it.  Even on the radio today I heard about school violence and school criminality being a worrying and increasing trend in our society. Our TV programs, our rappers and celebrities are not helping. 

I am fed up of hearing the cliché argument “but there are no jobs in Tunisia”. Hell, a job is not going to come knocking on your door; you have to get up early in the morning, have a nice attitude and go look for it. Believe in yourself and in your abilities and people will believe in you. I once heard the late boxing champion Joe Frazier say in a podcast “If you dress good, you will feel good and people will be good to you “. There is undeniable truth in that sentence. Despite all the skeptics and naysayers there are many booming industries in Tunisia and if there are problems these problems are faced by the whole world and not by us alone. Each of Tunisians need to be thankful that we are blessed to be part of this wonderful country and each of us needs to do his part to make sure that this country becomes as successful as it can be. We are on this ship together and there is enough room for each one of us. Each one of us can live like he wants too. With the rule of law and a common sense of citizenship our future can be only bright and promising. We need to exchange positively with other successful countries and make sure we stay friendly and respectable with them. Let Tunisia be a bridge between the west and the Middle East. Let us make the exception and show the whole world how exceptional and unique we can be.",,,,,,2022-10-06 17:37:13

So my question how long did this process take for you and where you live. And why this procedure takes so long if you have an idea about that because it seems that so most areas of the country are saturated in terms of internet. Is this just because of bad infrastructure? 
Also the agent at Ooredoo told me that if I have some connections with Tunisie Telecom I could pull some strings to make the process faster since it could take a long time. Smh..

He might have kids there. Is it a good idea or a bad one to look for him ?

&amp;#x200B;

Hello there,

I'm a 40 year old french guy. My father met my mother in Paris when he was studying computer science in a french university in 1980, he was teaching her mathematics as a side job (she was already working and was studying for a grade and a better job).One thing led to another, she was pregnant. She told him this and he told her that he was still leaving france at the end of his grade, which was before she would give birth. So he left and she raised me as a single mother.

She never hid anything about it and gave me his name anytime I asked for it. But she's from deep french decent so she could not transmit to me anything about my father's culture.

When I was 18 I searched for his name in phone books from the city she knew he was from and I found three reference. I called the phone numbers saying I was searching for a man that was studying in french in the 80's. The third call I had a woman who told me that it was her husband's home and he was a student in france. But I cannot remember what I told her then before ending the call.

Also, at this time, I was slowly understanding that I'm gay. So I put my father's legacy aside and didn't think about it for the next 20 years or so.

Now I'm a forty year old bachelor working in IT. I see the older generation slowly disappearing as my uncle died and his wife isn't well. And I saw a french drama which is partly about accepting our foreign legacy (Miskina, la pauvre) and I wondered again about who is my father, etc.

So the question is: Would a 70ish year old tunisian man who left a son 40 years ago in France would be at least partially happy to encoutner his gay son coming to meet him ? As I don't ""look gay"", i can leave the gay part in france, but I don't know the tunisian feelings about france and french etc and the mentality and openness of his generation. Or is it a really bad idea and must I let the tunisian part of my legacy be a cool trivia to tell about me ?

I'm partly curious what people here think because Tunisians born and raised in Tunisia often seem perplexed by the views and attitudes of the diaspora. So maybe this show doesn't resonate with you guys at all. Some of his experiences when he goes back to Egypt strongly correlate to my own in Tunisia though.

For those of use who are mixed, or raised abroad, it's also kinda weirdly nice to see familiar type faces and cultural markers on TV. I always thought that was overblown as positive reinforcement concept. But even though Ramy isn't Tunisian, it's kinda satisfying. Makes you feel seen and is even inspiring somehow. Lol and that's being nothing like the main character or having half the issues that he seems to have",,,,,,2022-10-08 08:47:07

I'm Moroccan, I had the chance to go to Tunis last month, I met many beautiful people and visited some of the touristic places and the not so touristic ones, it was surprisingly one of my best experiences, it felt like I was home but a different kind of home, like another version of Morocco, different vibes but same culture... I don't know how to portray it, it's a very beautiful country, for me at least.

But one thing I couldn't help but to notice, the infrastructures look old, old buses, trains, stations, trams or trino kif tqolo, bridges... I felt like I was walking in a 2007 Tunisia.

I lost my passport, and I'm trying to figure out how to go around it. my student status will expire soon since I'm graduating soon. Could that endanger my ability to get another visa in the future? Also, does the Tunisian embassy offers an outpass for such cases? , So I can go back to Tunisia and try to work on getting a new passport there.

Guys, are you satisfied with yourself watching porn? I've tried hardly to avoid it when everyone was familiar with it during high school, but at uni it became a regular thing for me to consult porn especially on weekends. I tried to avoid it for short periods of time (sort of sticking to a NoFap schedules), but urges and nudity almost everywhere in movies and series always trigger me and cause me to collapse.

I can't claim physical porn effects on me, but personally it drains my confidence and self-control. I feel guilt instead of pleasure, and porn is there uncontrollably accessible.

I need some advice please. Also, I'd love to form a community of Nofap Tunisia where we motivate and stand by each other.",,,,,,2022-10-10 09:37:09

y1blfb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/y1blfb/thoughts_about_tunisia_4/,11,Thoughts about Tunisia 4,"  I have read that some Greek philosopher once said that if you have a roof over your head and if you have a job and if you can walk then you have all three necessary conditions to be happy. I fully agree with him. I woke up early today. I had a good night’s sleep and felt like eating something hot and spicy instead of sweet. So I headed to the port. The fishing port. There is always a lot of activity there in the early morning: That is something you can count on. And I found what I was looking for. A vendor of Lablabi. A mixture of bread, beans, hot sauce, eggs, salt, harissa and other healthy ingredients. I’ve also read somewhere that a good breakfast is always a good idea. As I was slowly enjoying this traditional food I was looking around and making my usual observations. Cafes were open and full of customers. The rising sun offered a stunning grand spectacle with the godly light symphony organized with the clouds and starring the calm blue golden sea as the main protagonist. People were hurrying. Police officers talking to each other and checking the newly arriving. White big birds hovering loudly in the sky. Cats going through the fishnets looking for the lost forgotten fishes here and there. Truck drivers speeding in and out. The fish port is also home for the fish market. This is the place where the daily fish trading takes place. One man in front of the wall of the fishmarket building was carrying two sacks full of fish. He was loading them in a box in the rear of his motorbike. I know the guy. He works in the fish auction. He carries heavy stuff and works for a modest salary yet it is common that such workers receive gifts from the ship owners. So those two sacks are what we might call a bonus. A job benefit. I could see the happiness in his face as he was carefully arranging his cherished prize. I finished my food and sat in a dry clean spot when I get approached by an old acquaintance who works as a fisherman there. As common among many Tunisians he directly starts asking me private things about my private life. How many children I have. If I’m happy with my wife. I answer him calmly and amused and then unashamed and uninhibited I ask him myself about his own situation. 

“Last time we talked I told you already how we were about to divorce. I am so unhappy and miserable in my marriage. I am just waiting for my two daughters to marry and then I am going to divorce her. She yells at me, she disrespects me in front of my son and two daughters.” His hair was white. His work clothes were ragged and dirty. His face darkened by countless hours under the pitiless sun. I tell him to try bringing her a present once in a while. Even a simple thing. As a gesture of love and appreciation. Women love this kind of stuff, I tell him. He retorts:

“I’ve already done that. I brought her presents and gifts but to no avail. You know? There is a saying that goes like this: (The inferior stays always inferior. It never gets up and becomes superior)”

Another fisherman comes and joins us. He is also above 50 years old. My acquaintance instantly bombards him with personal questions the same. Turns out this dude has already divorced and that his son crossed the sea illegally and found his way to Italy. I decided to leave them because it became gradually obvious that they were going to start to hustle me for some dough and I happened to be short on change myself that morning.

Our society. Our men. Our rules. We should spend more time with our families. Men in Tunisia spend too much time among each other in cafes. Men should talk more to their wives. They should spend more time with them. We Tunisian men should forget about the patriarchy. It’s over. Women now are something else. Gone forever are the times of grandma and grandpa and how they lived and the standards of their relationships. There is now facebook, Instagram, Tiktok and all that stuff. A girl in the saddest most remote part of a little town in Tunisia can see and access the lifestyle of a girl in Santa Barbara, California. How she lives, dresses, talks, eats and behaves. A teacher once told me in school that the family is the basic unit of a society. If families are healthy then society will be strong and positive. We need to dedicate ourselves more to each other. Treat marriage like the holy commitment and responsibility that it is. I had an argument with my wife yesterday, she yelled at me in front of my kid. She literally told me to get the fuck out of her car. I did. No need to play the alpha male role with her. She is my wife after all. She is entitled to get angry. Today I took her for a cup of café in a nice place and we talked things over. We found a way. We need to keep finding ways. My dad used to hit my mom. Her dad used to hit her mom. It’s over now. Nobody is hitting anybody anymore. We need to teach our children that dialogue and mutual respect is the key. Not violence. And not lawyers. We need to be happy. Like that man with the two sacks full of fish. Life is full of bonuses and nice surprises. We just need to keep our eyes open.",,,,,,2022-10-11 15:12:55

Are you aware about the topic of a blackout situation?

How you prepare for an outage of the water supply through water bottles?

As I was in tunisia as tourist visiting the family, I saw the big problem already coming, without petrol, no trucks can transport and distribute the huge amounts of water bottles in the whole country.

I made water test stripe measurements in Sousse and Kasserine, while Sousse is chemically just not good, in Kasserine, there is lead (cause brain damage and cause issues in brain development of children) and other toxic minerals contaminating the water.

Are tunisian people aware about this coming situation?",,,,,,2022-10-11 21:15:30

Issued in French under the title Gérer la crise en temps d’incertitudes (Managing the crisis in times of uncertainty), the report forecasts economic growth of 2.7%  in 2022, largely due to the post-COVID recovery of tourism and trade, plus the solid performance of the mining and light manufacturing sectors. This growth rate is slightly lower than earlier World Bank forecasts, a reflection of the impact of the war in Ukraine. As a result, the economy is expected in 2022 to remain well below the pre-pandemic period. 

“Just as its economy started to recover from the COVID-19 crisis, Tunisia faced the double challenge of rising commodity prices and the war in Ukraine, which has put huge pressure on global wheat and energy supplies.” said Alexandre Arrobbio, World Bank Country Manager for Tunisia. “Cognizant of these unprecedented challenges, at the end of June, the World Bank granted a $130 million loan to Tunisia to help mitigate the impact of the war in Ukraine on food security. This will allow the government to finance grain purchases while initiating announced reforms,” added Arrobbio.

The first chapter of the report highlights how the war in Ukraine and rising global commodity and manufacturing prices exacerbated existing vulnerabilities of the Tunisian economy in the first months of 2022. Inflation rose from 6.7% in January 2022 to 8.1% in June 2022, prompting the Central Bank to raise its policy rate, the first increase since 2020. The trade deficit widened by 56% in the first semester of 2022, reaching 8.1% of GDP; and the budget deficit – pushed by mounting energy and food subsidies – is forecast to reach 9.1% in 2022, compared to 7.4% in 2021. 

The second chapter covers the food subsidy system - one of the key drivers of rising trade and budget deficits. In the case of wheat, the report shows that while this subsidy system kept prices stable for consumers, it put significant pressure on the state’s finances, penalized farmers and food processors, and generated over-consumption, with significant leakages and waste. The report stresses that replacing subsidized food prices with compensatory cash transfers to vulnerable households would make the system more efficient, reduce fiscal and import costs, and strengthen food security in the face of future shocks.",,,,,,2022-10-12 22:13:41

y2xxe2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/y2xxe2/thoughts_about_tunisia_5/,5,Thoughts about Tunisia 5,"  Most people of this group are blessed. Because they belong to those who have the chance to live in more than one country. This is a freedom that should not be taken for granted nor taken lightly. This is a privilege. We have seen more than one country in our lifetime. We have traveled. We took our bags and we left our countries and we have seen other parts of the world and by that decision alone we changed ourselves too. We have seen with our own eyes and we have felt with our own senses. And we have made memories that will live on forever with us and that would even have an effect on all our latter decisions and on all the people that we know. A few hundred years ago such enterprise was barely imaginable and travelling was restricted to a few privileged and financed with gold from Kings and Barons. Today we live in the globalization age. If you have the means, you could make it happen. I remember around 2009 I was reading an article about Cristiano Ronaldo travelling from Spain to the USA in his private jet to attend a highly prominent party in a lush nightclub somewhere there and that he would be back to training in Real Madrid the next day. The article included a picture of the star accompanied by a beautiful brunette, both of them laughing and holding drinks in their hands. I follow football. During one game of the German team the commentator mentioned that a player named Jerome Boateng is accustomed to travelling to Paris just for the sole purpose that his preferred haircutter is located there. Okay these are extreme examples that might be criticized for the unnecessary pollution caused by the private jets but I was trying to show that people always find a reason to travel and that technology and logistics nowadays have reached an unprecedented progressed level in the history of mankind. Tunisia is near Europe. 2 flight hours and you find yourself in a European metropolis in a whole different world. I love the feeling of travelling. Even within Tunisia itself travelling can give you such a healing and reviving feeling. Some unexpected beautiful suddenly perceived landscapes or horizons could hit one’s soul in an incomprehensible way. The sight of the reflection of the sun on a lake could make you feel something transcendental. You would just be in awe of the beauty of the uncustomary sighting.  Like something extremely important is calling you to understand it or to remember it. Nature is such a great phenomenon that is why we Tunisians must preserve our environment and cease polluting it. But travelling does not just involve landscapes and nature but primarily people too. What I most love about travelling is meeting new faces, new people with new attitudes and reactions and learning from them and exchanging stories and life experiences. For instance I remember a French girl I met in school because she belonged to an exchange program where students from France would visit us in Tunisia. She noticed that I was highly interested in a book in her hands called “If this is a man” by Primo Levi. She just gave me the book and said to me that I can keep it. As I was looking for money in my pockets to pay her she refused and insisted that I can have that book as a gift from her. And she added “Can I not give without having to get something in return?”. In French it sounds simpler : “ Faut il toujours avoir pour donner? That question startled me. This happened about 20 years ago and I still remember her words to this day. So powerful was that moment to me. Until then I never asked myself that question and until then I was taught that if you give without getting something back that means you were a fool and a dumb person but her decision at that moment rattled that conviction and unfounded it. And I learned maybe for the first time to see things from another perspective. Seeing things from other perspectives. This is what travelling is all about. What is highly important here could be trivial over there. What is mostly holy or complicated over there might be normal and simple over here. Each one of us has his own unforgettable memories that helped define him and that helped explain the world for him. Each one of us has met somewhere someday that stranger who leaved a nice impression and who engrained a word or an expression in our consciousness. We are a product of our environments in some sense and travelling could only bring richness of character with it and an increase of the strength of personality. And for those who cannot afford travelling believe me when I tell you that reading is the ultimate way of travelling. You just read a good book and at the end of it you will find out that you most probably have made the best journey you could possibly make. If I may share a discovery I made during my last lecture, I came across the term “ Aspen tree”. That kind of tree does not exist in Tunisia and they have special leaves that make very special sounds. The leaves flutter in the lightest wind. I typed aspen tree in youtube and I found several videos dedicated to the calming relaxing natural sound that these leaves make. Our world is so rich and technology nowadays brings us even the sounds of the tropical forest with the birds and creatures that we never saw and otherwise would never have heard. Just always remember we are blessed and we should say thanks.",,,,,,2022-10-13 12:50:30

What would such a language look like ?

The current Tunisian dialect is a patchwork language of multiple vocabularies and grammar rules that tries to pass as Arabic for political and ideological reasons. All the while, the (very resilient) amazigh culture and language are beginning to die off. Modern Tunisian contains a lot of amazigh words and expressions, which were preserved by marginalized communities. In turn this lead the public to view these words as inferior and stupid compared to pure arabic (jokes on them French is doing to Arabic what Arabic did to Amazigh). Of course, that's absolute bullshit, and frankly it's thanks to those communities that we may be able in the future to revive a standard tunisian amazigh (Let's call it ⵜⴰⵜⵓⵏⵙⵉⵜ tatounsit) that would closely ressemble darija but with legit grammar rules, modernized vocabulary and literary potential just like it was done in Morocco and Algeria before. Of course the particularity of our language and it's main asset is how easily it can absorb other languages. History happened and this is not about erasing it, a tunisian amazigh would of course keep influences it gained from phoenician, latin, arabic, french, italian and turkish.",,,,,,2022-10-13 15:36:42

Flash forward to last year,I was in 2nd year of highschool in the science division while I was still averaging 15 score,it was clear that I was lifting up my score with the secondary subjects but It only hit me that I was an a7feth/sob student when I got a 7 in physics when we were being taught vecteurs/moments(something that required actual skill/thought process).
And now I'm 3eme math and in physics classes I feel overwhelmed or out of the loop.

Should I switch to another section?

My current plan is to finish the year and if I'm still having trouble ,I would just switch to eco or another section (especially since I discovered a new internal joy for history/geography but I don't want to change sections then be hit with the ""تكثر من الحلو يمسات"" since I used to enjoy physics when it was more electric based)",,,,,,2022-10-14 20:19:12

I fell in love with this handsome tunisian guy who is 25 years old.

Problem: I learnt from the interactions and expectations that tunisian men (even those between 160cm and 170cm  men)only consider 170cm+ women to be attractive.

I lived in different counties in Europe,, Canada, and USA. The men and women there don't have much expectations on dating  based on things they don't choose(race,ethnic group, height....). Even if they do, this is just ""preference"" not a ""must-have"".

Most men in Tunisisa however, from what I see, seem adamant with not giving women the time of the day if she isn't tall enough. 

A Tunisian female friend of mine is the same height as me, and said that in their culture, tallness is expected on women for them to be considered ""a person"". And that surprisingly, a short man in tunisia is more acceptable than a short woman.

Idk if I am wrong? Which is why I posted this here.

What do you think of women my height? Do you think my tunisian crush will reject me because of my missing 13cm?

1st I'll give you some context, I'm 24 yo and I work as a primary school teacher. This is my 3rd year. 

Like many of my peers, I didn't choose to be a teacher but under my family pressure and the high unemployment rates in Tunis, I was forced into it, even though I never wanted to be a teacher and I have other ambitions. In short, I was manipulated. 

So, during the last 2 years, I focused on making money from the internet by doing the stuff I love: freelancing and selling courses and digital products. Together they make me a decent chunk of money around double to triple my salary from teaching.

Lately, I've been really considering quitting teaching for good, to solely focus on my online work, but at the same time, there's that feeling of unease: what if everything goes south, what if in 10 years my whole online work crumbles... 

So I'm asking for your advice. What would you do if you were in my position? Should I quit or keep juggling both jobs?

some of the research that i did online (not extensive or deep, an hour or 2 at most) showed that some pharmaceuticals and treatments can be effective like, Minoxidil+Micro-needling, Oral Dutasteride, RU58841, and Finasteride... . if any anyone is aware of doctor, a dermatologist perhaps that can prescribe some of these medications for me (if they decide they are appropriate or beneficial to me after consultation of course) or can help me with my issue in general i will be grateful.

To create one you will need your MobileID.

So here is my journey getting my MobileID and testing it by ordering 2 Birth certificates (AR/FR) online.

\-9:30 am : I applied for a MobileID (you only need a phone number under your name) [https://www.mobile-id.tn](https://www.mobile-id.tn)

\-9:34 am : received the confirmation SMS with ID number.

\-9:45 am: I went to the nearby boutique of my mobile network provider with my CIN.

\-9:55 am: I received the approval SMS with my PIN.

\-10:05 am: I logged in the MobileID platform and [downloaded the app.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kaoun.gov.mct.mobileid.gms&amp;hl=en-GB)

\-10:07am: I received my cryptographic certificate from TunTrust.

\-10:10am: I logged in the administration platform using my MobileID. [https://e-bawaba.tn/](https://e-bawaba.tn/)

\-10:12 am: I requested 1 Birth certificate in AR and another in FR.

\-10:14 am: 2xDigitally signed Birth certificates downloaded.(currently for free)

The UX is clear and the process is smooth enough.

For a beta platform, I'm impressed.

Congratulations for the [TCTD team](https://www.facebook.com/MinistereTCTD) for job well done.

I feel miserable in the private HS and I live far away so I have to wake up at 6AM everyday(I live in Ben Arous and study in el Marsa go figure)  and I miss my old friends(I have some friends in the private HS but they're superficial friends that are externs so I don't talk to them that often)

""The departure of foreign pharmaceutical companies from Tunisia will lead to higher drug prices.

Fourteen months of arrears. These are the debts of the Tunisian Central Pharmacy to three major foreign laboratories, reveals the president of the National Chamber of Trade Unions of the Pharmaceutical Industry, Tarek Hammami, on Monday, October 24, 2022.

Bayer, GSK and Novartis are closing their offices in Tunisia, Mr Hammami explained in a telephone interview on Shems FM's Matinale. However, they will continue to fulfill contracts for the local production of licensed medicines, the same source said.

""In addition to accumulating arrears with the central pharmacy, these labs face difficulties in registering their patent-protected innovations and getting reimbursed by the CNAM. They now have to negotiate for five to six years to reach an agreement on reimbursement and often fail to do so,"" he said.

When asked about the impact, he pointed to the loss of jobs and access to innovation. Noting that Tunisia has fallen significantly behind in access to innovative products in the Middle East and North Africa region, ranking second to last, he explained that the process of registering innovations allows the country to negotiate these drugs at preferential prices. ""Tunisia can still have access to these innovative products, but at exorbitant prices if there is no registration.""  ""

Context: My mother immigrated to the US from Tunisia when she was young, and I've always wanted to take her there and visit because she hasn't been back since.

Problem: I am a transmasculine person. I mostly pass as male when in public and have medically transitioned.

Question: What sorts of things should I know regarding being trans in Tunisia? I go stealth for safety reasons whenever traveling, but is there anything in particular I need to be respectful of or careful with? Places that are slightly safer for people like myself?

Thank you for reading and considering my questions! Have a good day!

Update 10/26: Thank you so much for your comments and help! I hope to one day support my mother in visiting her place of birth, and also to have a chance to learn about my family's heritage in a safe and respectful way. I feel a bit more informed and will do more research on the things you have provided 💜🙏🏾",,,,,,2022-10-25 21:17:50

Latin Americans came mainly from iberia not the italian peninsula and have nothing to do with italians, and iberians are not latins they just speak latin languages and have latin culture which replaced their native iberian languages and culture when the Italian people invaded and romanized them in roman conquests

My question is why does latin americans consider themselves latins and spain, Portugal [are grouped under latin europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latins)  even though they are ethnically different from italians, while a lot of tunisians don’t consider themselves arabs or arabic country even though it’s the exact same situation as latin America and latin europe ?

Can this be explained as self contempt from tunisians toward themselves ?

Edit: just a simple note everyone seem to not know it or ignore

 - **The Latins were originally an Italic tribe in ancient central Italy from Latium**

- **spanish and Portuguese original spoke native iberian languages and practiced native iberian culture but it was wiped out when the italians/latins/romans invaded, massacred, killed,raped them**

His rapists were 3 of his classmates , three 13 y.o ,three KIDS. The good thing that the little boy told his parents and they immidiatly pressed charges against them. The three boys got caught and  admitted to the crime and also said "" we just wanted to know what sex feels like, we wanted to rape a girl but none of the girls trusted us so we chose this boy because he's shy and have no friends."" The police officers were choked that they told everyone to be careful with their children and who interact with them. Also police called child services and took the three boys with them. The bad thing they can't go to اصلاحية because it's illegal for  kids aged between 11-13 to go there but they send them to Child services to get some psychiatric help and also to wait for their 14th birthday so they can go to prison. It just crazy how ""sex"" is painted as a goal for young boys that they are willing to do a crime to get it or even be a victim of a female pedophile .

Here is a link to start the compensation/claim process with Tunisair :  
[https://www.tunisair.com/site/publish/content/article.asp?ID=1049](https://www.tunisair.com/site/publish/content/article.asp?ID=1049)

  
As a general rule, **when flying from or to a country from the EU, and reaching destination with more than 3 hours after the scheduled time of arrival, you are entitled to a compensation**.   
Here is a summary of your right, as you can be entitled to more compensation depending on what happens (denied boarding, broken luggage, etc..) :   
[https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/passenger-rights/air/index\_en.htm](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/passenger-rights/air/index_en.htm)  


Also, be aware that most companies try to deny the compensation. But in the end, it's a law, and they are required to adhere to it. Extraordinary circumstances are well defined, and if in doubt, you can check it online. 

Lastly, if you find yourself stuck during the request, and if you wish to have a team representing your case, you can find numerous websites that will process the request for you, but they will then take a percentage of your compensation for their work (usually, you don't need to pay anything upfront, it's just taken from your compensation).

Let's hope Tunisair will improve, as we all want to have a flag carrier we are proud of. Every action will have an impact, and that's how we can try to improve things as customers.",,,,,,2022-11-02 12:47:30

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;According to a cable sent by the US embassy in Tunis on 22 September, 2006, Microsoft was so keen to get the Tunisian government to ***drop its policy favouring open-source software*** that it agreed to set up a ""program on cyber criminality "" to cover training. The deal also entailed the company giving the Tunisian regime, headed by President Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, ***the original source code for Microsoft software***.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In turn, the GOT agreed to purchase 12,000 licences to update government computers with official Microsoft software, ***rather than the pirated versions that have been commonly used***, according to one Microsoft employee. Since 2001, the GOT adopted an open software policy, using only free software programs.

I just don't care about anything anymore.I'm no longer interested in anything,most of the hobbies I had no longer interest me.

What to do?

Edit:
I can't find the motivation to do anything. 
I used to get 15 average score just last year but now my grades have declined since I'm in a more difficult branch(3eme math) and harsher exams(the lycee I'm in is known for having pilote like exams).

I used to have big ambitions of living/working abroad but now I don't have those ambitions anymore since no matter what I do abroad ,I will never be considered a true citizen.


Also I lost the motivation to study to get a job since 100%of the people I will be competing against will have the same degree as me.

So by that you can see I have no motivation to study,now whenever people ask me what is my dream profession ,I say it is to be unemployed 

If my grades keep plummeting ,I'm seriously considering dropping out of school or at least finish bac or maybe switch to bac eco(the upsetting thing is I used to get good grades just last year but this year I already failed(7rebt) my physics/math exam and it seriously made a jab on my already unstable mental health)

However, mentally I'm exhausted and lost (reasons varies, we should leave this to my future Psy) and I come from a simple family with a huge history of schizophrenia and Mental illnesses.
I'm aware that self diagnosis is a bad idea and asking/searching on the internet is not the best solution.

I tend to over prepare and I hate failure, so I'm here doing my homework on how to get a successful experience, and I'm willing to invest if the chances are favorable. 

My sole issue is: I rarely heard positive/successful stories when it comes to Tunisian Psychologists and I know that this field is not as researched/developed as in let's say Europe or US (maybe I'm wrong)

I could've just asked a simple question, but I thought these details are helpful.

The official explained that Tunisia has always stored the production surplus to compensate for the lower harvests in autumn, which did not happen this year due to the reluctance of traders who feared being accused of monopoly and speculation.

Farmers had engaged in traditional stockpiling, which resulted in large losses due to extreme weather conditions and high prices for the products needed to maintain stocks, he said.

""The solution would be to open the market to regulation by supply and demand (free market) and not to set thresholds (fixed prices by the government) that would encourage monopolies. Those responsible for this situation would have to be held accountable. The market must be freed, even if prices will rise two or three points, they would eventually regulate themselves,"" he continued"".

Im following the Tunisian thread since a while, and often I see the problems of corruption mentioned in the comments. As I'm a German, living in Germany and have family in Tunisia, Im into this thing and as an entrepreneur, I want to improve the life of people and solve problems.

For this reason, I made a draft of a platform to remove corrupted people from transactional services.

 Please tell me you're thinking and design flaws I have, so it could improve it. The goal is to remove corrupted people from transactions, to build more trust to other people and gaining life quality by knowing that you can trust a person or a company for the quality of service.

If the system is in production, the system will handle all this automatically by the given rules, there is no chance then, to change the points.

The only problem what I see is, to use the application, the user have to provide their identity card ID, so its verifiable that the name of the person, match with the name on the identity card and that the user have to have an account on the platform to participate on this system to reduce the corruption.

What you think?

# Process

The Customer A want a Product or Service from a Business Entity (Shop/Private Person) and pays money for it, this is a transaction. The Transaction can be verified by both sides with a QR Code.  


As Example: Customer A want a repair of a Lamp in his living room, he specifies this in the transaction. Then the company member who is processing the work, will scan the QR code and confirm/compare that the transaction is the same, as the Customer provided the details to the company, if it doesnt match, the company member will not process the work, as potential fraud is possible. After the work is done, the user has to confirm that the work was made the right way, if the confirmation is not made in 7 days, the Customer is loosing reputation points.  
Reputation Points: Every user/company has reputation points, everyone starts with 10 points, the basic trust that you give a user/company, that they will do the job. If they don't follow the procedures, they loose reputation points. If a user or a company is reaching 0 points, they get marked as potential corrupt and get a warning.If they get into debt, so -5, -10 points, they get listed as not trustable person/entity, whenever they want to make a transaction with another person/entity. A person or business entity will be notified about that they will loose reputation points when working with a corrupted entity.  
To separate corrupted people from a health society, people who proceed a transaction with a not trustable person, will be punished by loosing reputation points",,,,,,2022-11-11 08:04:36

So in France after years of Church rule (in Tunisia's case years of Islamist rule) the homogeneous conservative catholic population revolted killing both clerks and aristocrats. During the dictatorship the Islamist movement used to say ( It is all the fault of the dictator if we were to rule it would be better) During these 10 years we witnessed that they are not able to rule. Now that Kais is dictatory to not say a dictator they are returning to their old rhetoric and it is working and more and more people are becoming more religious look at this thread for example it was filled with ""ouvert d'esprit"" people to not say ""3ami9iin"" and now it is filled with conservative Muslims. To give you an idea I am an atheist and even I thought that these people were too much. 
I am naturally against illegal violence, but to get rid of Islamists for good So we can have a running democracy. I believe there are 2 ways: A laïc dictator killing them like Bourguiba planned to do before the putsch, or the people  revolting against them and killing them after years of dysfunctional democracy. I wish I am wrong and I am writing this so that someone might convince that there is a future for Tunisia that doesn't include the shedding of blood. I don't care about democracy or equality even though I would prefer them I just want my country to be functional that is not much to ask.",,,,,,2022-11-12 16:24:59

I want to ask, whether its a known problem or whether only specific phone operators are affected.

Me and my mom calling often our family in tunisia via land line, via whatsapp etc. its working without problems. 

But when we call over the mobile phone grid, in tunisian site, its appears a tunisian phone number, which can not be called back, and which is shown up as a spam phone number.

As Im into digital stuff, the behavior of spam shows me, that its used for mass calls/messaging, but its not clear, why the german phone number/call doenst get forwarded to the tunisian phone in tunisia.

Our family in tunisia has Ooredoo and Orange, both seems to be affected, from german site it can not be the problem, our family in czech problem never had such a problem, so the problem has to be in tunisia, but we dont know how to solve this. 

Do you have experience with this issue? What is happening there? Who is the responsible entity to contact?

I appreciate every help.

I understand that, but I don't see that there will be much of a difference compared to people here in Tunisia, tunisians like me. I mean people are respectful and kind, but when I took my first job in Tunis, I tried asking people to hang out, guys and girls ( some for dates, some others as friends ), classmates I knew from University, people from work and the thing is that they see Yes at first, but all of them come up with a late minute excuse.

* One friend from college left me on read after asking him if he wants to have a coffee on Sunday
* A coworker said yes but has to wait for a delivery, then he will message me. He never did and I simply assumed he is not interested and was shy to say that. Next day he told me that the delivery came late and I said it's ok. He never rescheduled or proposed another day.
* Two girls canceled before 2 or 3 hours from meeting me.
* A friend from college said Yes and she will call me after an interview. She called late at night and said that the interview took longer than she thought and I said that's ok, we will try it next time. I left it to her to plan it if she wants to hang out, which she never did.

Maybe that's not the case for anyone. My guess is that it's not that different from other western countries and the difference is seen since people associated it with being a foreigner. I'd rather say some Tunisians here 'fake' that they are indeed interested in going out and would like to associate, but deep down they don't and just want to go home and chill because it's such a pain to go out in Tunis since it's, well, not very safe, public transportation sucks and so on ...",,,,,,2022-11-14 01:01:07

yva66l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/yva66l/shame_and_name_platform/,10,shame and name platform,"The platform exists in the US and South Korea
it's called teamblind.com

It's an ANONYMOUS forum where professionals can discuss freely about work related stuff like reviews of companies, salaries, any type od harrasmemt/misconduct, or any other subject related to work. 

I was wondering if creating a Tunisian version will be a good idea without getting into legal troubles with companies.


How can people connect fo to the platform?

1) By using your active work email, you receive an email to verify your account and a random username is assigned to you. So on your profile you the only visible info is your username and company name. Users can trust you when you give ur opinion about your company or the industry you work in.


2) Normal email but you will only have READ only access that means you can't post and comment. 


Benefits of the platform:
-  Sharing your opinion without making enemies in the industry, avoiding HRs in your industry hating on you or people in your company...
- Many taboo subjects can be discussed, like salaries 
- name and shame, companies with bad culture can be exposed without the exposer having to risk his/her professional life. 


My concern:
- People don't use their work email fearing that someone in the company can have access to their inbox and notice the verification email send by the platform and this can get them in trouble (i don't think anyone in the company has access to someone else's inbox) 
- Companies suing the creators of the platform becoz of tarnishes reputation (i don't know if this is legally feasible) 


Is it worth it to create such  a platform in Tunisia taking into consideration people's mentality and the egal system?",,,,,,2022-11-14 19:39:26

I am wondering if I can buy a laptop and an iPad and ship them here using ""Shop n Ship"". 

1- Has anyone does this before?

2- Did you get your item in a good shape or it was meddled with/stolen?

3- Were you asked to pay a big custom duty on it? Would it be any different if you show them that you're a business?

4- Is Shop n Ship the safest option compared to La Poste (for any theft or legal issues)?

Edit: I get the cost with diwana may make it very expensive, but first, how much is this cost roughly? 19% of the total bill? 

Also, the laptops I am talking about are ones that cost originally $1000, and that are sold on BF for like $599. I am happy to spend another $200 for shipping and diwana if I know I will get my laptop. If I buy it from here, it will cost me probably $1200, and I won't get any discount on it.

why do we have the need to shit on ppl's creativity, why do we have to be the active bully in the group, the guy is only sharing fashion trend, he's not forcing you to wear it.

for those who don't know, amine has been sharing many American fashion trend, that he likes, most of them is what you'd expect from a fashion trend ""not in our culture"", what's the rational response to that ?... hate, bullying, mocking etc

just have some empathy and let ppl be",,,,,,2022-11-17 00:03:33
yxgnzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/yxgnzp/seeking_advice/,6,seeking advice,"So I'm a first year medical student and the more I study the more I find out that it might not be for me. A lot of people around me are extremely passionate about it and dream of becoming doctors but I personally never had such a goal. The subjects \*aren't\* the problem, in fact they are(mostly) fun. (minus the pressure of having to memorize an insane amount of content for tests you have no idea how you will do on because you can't find any practice tests) but it's the job part. I do not see myself enjoying being a doctor and dealing with patients + I am not really interested in illnesses, I am more interested in the fundamentals that we're studying rn than how to treat diseases(will be our main focus starting from 3rd year)+ there's very little freedom and so much one has to sacrifice to become a doctor that unless it's truly your dream in life you will probably regret it. which is why i'm considering quitting early. I did réo aout and got prépa first so I think I have the option of applying to prépa next year but i'm not sure. 

For context I was a bac math student and would say doing pure math or theoretical physics research would be my passion but idk how available becoming a researcher is in tunisia or how good that path is financially speaking or how hard/easy it is to work abroad or how good the quality of education (physics specially cuz labs need money and maintenance..) compared to other institutions internationally and would I be risking unemployment following it etc..

i'm also interested in software engineering so would love to hear abt that(mainly if it pays well and if there's job security in it)

also for those who know, is it possible to do research as a doctor ? i don't mean disease research but scientific, smth akin to what someone with a phd would be doing. If that's the case i might just stick with it and do neuroscience research and hopefully ditch the dealing with patients part.

would love to hear your thoughts on this. Is sticking with medicine worth it?is switching to smth else worth it?

I wanted share with you, how the corruption in german government look like, so you can compare about it with the tunisian government corruption.

Summary: The Green Party lead ministry for economy is looking for a Photographer who will get 350.000€ for the next 4 years paid.

This is 87.500 Euro (290.000 DT) per year, this is 7.290 Euro (24.200 DT) per month, a good paid full time worker get in germany before taxes 2.800€ ([https://www.destatis.de/EN/Themes/Society-Environment/Income-Consumption-Living-Conditions/Income-Receipts-Expenditure/Tables/income-expenditure-territory-lwr.html;jsessionid=366423E4036DD5A96710150A02C88324.live721](https://www.destatis.de/EN/Themes/Society-Environment/Income-Consumption-Living-Conditions/Income-Receipts-Expenditure/Tables/income-expenditure-territory-lwr.html;jsessionid=366423E4036DD5A96710150A02C88324.live721), check the row:  **Gross income from dependent employment**) the total income is not realistic and is only ""beautifying"", but the reality. Here a table what jobs get paid in germany: [https://karrierebibel.de/gehaltsvergleich/](https://karrierebibel.de/gehaltsvergleich/)

The Photographer get in average 243€ per day, what is around 806 DTA similar paid job is vice chair of a company/ Co-CEO / Prokurist.

Thats how german government is wasting tax payers money, while we have to freeze as the gas too expensive.

Nothing seems to be more important to this exceptional political talent in the current situation than his #self-staging at the expense of #taxpayers!  
&gt;  
&gt;In the past, princes and kings had poorly paid court painters who made embellished portraits. Today, government officials have well-paid photographers snapping embellished portraits. Well, at least the salary has very obviously improved...#socialpolicy  
&gt;  
&gt;Sorry, but Germany is looking a bit more like an open psychiatric ward every day since the #Greens co-governed.... The hard cases sit on the government bench, the new blood is stuck on the street....  
&gt;  
&gt;We citizens, however, are no longer blinded by any photo.... It is only a matter of time until society will understand who the real exploiters are and who stands up for any concerns of the people at all! Example: Climate!  
&gt;  
&gt;Do any of you think it's right, important and good that over 800 private jets flew to Egypt for the #ClimateSummit to tell us from there that we should all cycle to work because otherwise we'll destroy the planet....

I am having trouble finding a car rental place that will allow us to drop a car off in Gabes - does anyone know where we could organise this?

Or would you recommend travelling around Tunisia a different way (e.g. Louage or just public transport)? We like the freedom of being able to stop wherever you want with a rental car but would consider other transport options as well.

Up until this year I averaged 15-16-17 score but now I doubt I'll even finish the year.
This country made me feel like I'm some sort of genius for being able to use règle de trois in physics and copying/pasting formulas in math and using history/geography/civil education as tar9i3 for the other bad grades in other subjects.

I already got 9.25 in physics and I'm definitely not getting above 8 in French/Arabic and I'm definitely getting a 0.25 in maths.

I realised that I'm an a7feth/sob student and also that I'm very lazy/a procrastinator who relied heavily on étude(I used to get the hang of it in étude and chill at home,I never studied outside of étude)but now I realised that I don't even like the stuff that I'm studying so in étude I started to not care whether I understand what I'm being told/taught.

I can't work hard even if I know that my whole future depends on it.

I'm considering either finishing the year and switching to bac eco or bac technique or redoing the whole year in either bac eco or bac section?

I even started considering dropping out and becoming unemployed which is very annoying since I used to have big ambitions before this year started but what can I say I like اللقمة الباردة and I don't like anything that's actually challenging",,,,,,2022-11-20 20:13:45

4. Must all the payments come straight to a Tunisian bank account, or can I keep my money in Payoneer and only withdraw the tax amount?
5. Does it allow me to open a business bank account? Is it required to have one?
6. Does it allow me to open a bank account in foreign currency (dollars/euros)?
7. Are there any ""hidden recurrent costs""? Something like a flat fee to pay every month/year to keep the company alive?
8. If for some reason I cannot find clients/decide to take an extended pause, can the company stay ""dormant""?
9. Are there any other benefits to opening enterprise individuelle? (Like being able to spend/take more money abroad?
10. Once set up, is it possible to operate it from abroad? Like are there things that need to be done frequently that require my physical presence in Tunisia?
11. EDIT 1: Do you know if there is a way to completely set the company up from abroad? Kinda like how you are able to open an LLC in the US easily through some companies.

I work for a global company so everything is fine at the office. However, when I go to places outside, I usually get stares and I can't even count how many ""Ni hao""s I've received already. Teenage girls would often come up to me too and say ""hi/hello"". 

The good side I guess is that people in sales/waiters seems to treat me really nicely. They give extra attention to my needs, which is awesome.

تعادلت تونس والدنمارك 0-0 في افتتاح المونديال. على الرغم من أن تونس كانت المستضعف في تلك المباراة ، إلا أنها تنافست بشكل جيد ضد فريق أوروبي قوي. لديهم أفضل فرصة للفوز بكأس العالم في المباراة القادمة ضد أستراليا.

&amp;#x200B;

تونس لديها دفاع قوي جيد التنسيق. في تسعة من المباريات العشر السابقة ، كانوا بدون أهداف.

&amp;#x200B;

خسرت أستراليا أمام فرنسا في المباراة الافتتاحية للموسم 4-1. وسجلت أستراليا الهدف الأول في تلك المباراة في الدقيقة التاسعة ، لكن فرنسا واصلت الفوز بالمباراة. قد تنهي أستراليا حتى دور المجموعات بدون نقاط لأنها أسوأ فريق في المجموعة.

&amp;#x200B;

خط الهجوم الأسترالي ضعيف. في المباريات الأربع السابقة ، سجلوا أربعة أهداف فقط. هذه المباراة بين المنتخبين الجزائري وتونس حاسمة لكلا البلدين لأن أي شيء يمكن أن يحدث إذا تعثر أحد أصحاب الوزن الثقيل في المجموعة الرابعة.

I never thought that i would ask the internet about an advice but here i am :

I am in my early thirties , holder of master of research degree in finance and with over 7 years of work experiences in many fields starting from telecommunication , Tourism, Construction and real state business ,   Wholesale and retail of agro-food products  and now with an international well known firm specialized in  IT, Finance and consulting services  as a sales administrator i make a little over 2k dinars in month with many bonuses and advantages and most of the time i work from home .

In june of this year i signed a 'CDI' contract with a french company in Brest working in the field of windev and consulting as a junior consultant . Due to the changes in french laws regarding new arrivals and immigration i lost hope that i will receive my work permit and forgot about it and about leaving Tunisia . Until last week when my french employer sent an me an email telling me that the work request is accepted, french authorities sent me the work permit and now i should start the procedures with OFII and TLS.

The problems is : I started to panic a little bit and having second thoughts. well this new french job will pay me over 1900 euros a month , my employer will pay half of my transportation fees and  a 9 euros a day of food tickets . I checked the rent in Brest and i found that a small 30m² with furniture is over 600 euros adding the prices of food , internet , electricity and water fees there will no much left to keep it to a side .

Here in Tunisia a live with my parents and beside my car expenses i dont spend much , sometimes i dont even touch my salary for 4 months , but the future in Tunisia is kind of dark and unpredictable. Today i live well cause cause i am with my family , the day i will start one of my own things will be a lot harder.

Many questions in my mind some of them push me to go and start from zero and rely on my own in everything which will be hard specially at first and some push me to stay in my confort zone.

Either ways i need to make a decision cause my OFII rendez-vous is very soon and hope you guys can help me with you thoughts and ideas .

Any help is very much appreciated

Thank you all",,,,,,2022-11-26 11:42:41

I work as a freelancer in Europe I'm considering moving my work to Tunisia.

Watched this [video](https://youtu.be/GRT5fc0Fm4M) and I visited the lawyer he suggested, but she asked  around 1400$ for doing the paper and legal work is this sound reasonable?

She even said I should pay the same amount for renewal every year.

It sounds wrong to me.

in the video the guy said, you can do it the hard way with 200TND or a bit more.

It is not about the money for me I just feel I got used, I speak Arabic and I can go through the pain of doing it myself, I just don't have time.

Are these the only options I have?

I really wanna benefit the country even a little bit, invest pay taxes even though I can set up my company anywhere in the world I just prefer Tunisia.

Hopefully, there is another route.

I do wanna get in shape so I would appreciate a gym buddy as well.

I'm kind of an introvert but I want to make friends here for occasional coffees chill sometimes after work or in weekends.

Some of you might think this is weird that I'm looking for friends here as a grown man, to put it simply all of my friends live in Ariana, and with work and weekly responsibilities visiting them sometimes in the weekends became difficult especially with the ""rakcha"" cold weather (but ofc we still keep contact till this day, it was much easier before tho because I was a student and had more free time).

Anyways, I'm looking for some fun genuine light hearted people who share some of my interest and around my age but most importantly generally fun spontaneous folks \^\^

I just saw a post in here .. about someone who was asking how to invest 70k ... He also raise a question about the money being legal or not ... Sounds like he doesn't wanna discuss it with strangers but he needed to mention it... So .. most of the comments were on how to clean the money ... Is it cash or in a bank .. the easiest way to make it legal ... .
that got me wondering.. here is my question... Do I need to clean 100k in Tunisia? Like buy a house and loan it to a friend bla bla bla ... Or it depends ... Because I'm pretty sure if I go to a bank with 50k in cash and disposit them in my account that won't be a problem nor raising any flags ...

## the history of tunisia through music

  

Tunisia is a country in North Africa that borders the Mediterranean Sea. It's one of the most popular destinations for tourists from all over the world. The country is rich in culture and history, and this is reflected in its music. Many songs are dedicated to the country's geography and people. By preserving its music, the country is preserving its heritage.

Music has always been an integral part of Tunisian life. Songs chronicle life in the country and celebrate national heritage. The lyrics can be in Arabic, French or Tunisian Arabic, which is a mixture of both languages. Many songs tell the stories of people living in Tunisia; these are called bardic traditions. This oral history has been passed down through generations and is still performed today. The songs reflect the different cultures living in Tunisia; they celebrate both indigenous practices and those brought by immigrants from other parts of Africa.

Tunes are played throughout the country to celebrate events and traditions. For example, weddings are typically celebrated with a tune called 'Fennec fox'. This song celebrates how foxes run quickly with little effort. This represents how quickly a celebration can happen in the country. Other common tunes include lullabies for newborns and patriotic songs celebrating Tunisia's independence from France. These songs tell of the struggles faced by many who lived through the Tunisian revolution in 2011-12. Songs about this period are still being written today to commemorate the sacrifices made by those living through these events.

Musicians contribute a large amount of revenue to the economy. In 2015, musicians made up 17% of all male employment in Tunisia. Many musicians earn money playing at weddings, festivals and on radio stations. In rural areas, musicians use traditional instruments like a 'tawath', a stringed instrument similar to a guitar or mandolin. However, some artists use electronic music to bring new sounds to the country's music scene. That being said, most popular music in Tunisia remains ' Rai rap ', or rap performed in Tunisian Arabic dialects.

Music has always been an important part of Tunisian culture- even though it's difficult to preserve through modern technology and media outlets. Songs tell of past struggles and current events; they celebrate both local traditions and those from other countries living in Tunisia. Plus, musicians contribute greatly to the economy through their revenue generated from playing tunes.

([https://linktr.ee/tpl.tn](https://linktr.ee/tpl.tn)) 

We started with basic technical content written in the Tunisian dialect so that we can grow an audience and so on. Last year, we started creating local university clubs and we reached +15 club by this year alone. We exist in multiple governments. Check this link if you wanna see their work [https://linktr.ee/tpl.clubs](https://linktr.ee/tpl.clubs) 

For the long run I had this vision of creating an ecosystem that can use the local talent, nurture it and invest it into meaningful projects and maybe startups ideas that can develop the Tunisian ecosystem. 

This group of ideas is called the TuniverseGroup([https://www.TuniverseGroup.com](https://TuniverseGroup.com)) 

We've been trying to launch few things in the last year and a half now, stuff like: 

\- [https://www.edspace.tn](https://www.edspace.tn) : an e-learning platform for college students

\- https://www.app.stagii.tn : a place where you can find a bunch of internships offers(though, this is just phase 1) 

\- [https://rapportpfe.tn](https://rapportpfe.tn) : trying to college a bunch of ""pfe"" reports in one place for students, still needs a lots of work tho 

&amp;#x200B;

Its been a rough journey with a lot of troubles since there's 0 support from the government besides the bullshit forms you have to fill to play less tax or something, that's not what we want or need. 

For this to work, it needs a serious investment in the community itself and how we can build solic networks and get enough push, funding or whatever to work on those projects and actually put those developers and talented engineers in something meaningful.

&amp;#x200B;

Off to **Tunisia** in January for a week. It will be my second time going, with the last time being May 2022. I am in good hands with a local, so it won't matter if the holiday is more authentic.

I am wondering whether to book the same hotel in **Yasmine Hammamet**, or to book more in the Tunis area. The deciding factor is if Hammamet closes a lot of its shops/restaurants/bars/activities in the winter.

If anyone knows about **Hammamet in Winter months**, please let me know if it's still worth a visit :)

So, I'm a software engineer, I've been looking for ways to ""make more money"" in a shorter time frame for a while now,aka going abroad so that I can hopefully come back home and retire early. (or at least have the option of doing so). 

I have a relative who's a mechanical engineer that got a life changing opportunity about 7 years ago.

He went to work in the middle East, in the UAE precisely. He lived and worked there for about 5-6 years. And it was totally worth it for him despite the fact that he was working upwards of 18 hour days and was away from his family for months on end. 

He was smart with his money, he didn't spend it on anything that wasn't considered essential. That's what allowed him to come back home with 2M+, and yes that's in dollars.

Now yes, there's a catch. He worked on super yachts. And took commissions. But hadn't he told me how much he made. I wouldn't have realised that making such money in 5-6 years is indeed possible.

Now the reason why I'm here, is because, I don't know the prospects of IT in the middle East. So if someone here knows anything about it/worked there in IT. Please do enlighten us.

Tldr: is the IT field in the middle East worth working in?",,,,,,2022-12-10 19:29:54

I am a patriotic person and I hate seeing you complain about Tunisia for X or Y. The country is filled with untouched potential yet is about to go bankrupt like Lebanon. (Which also an excellent country btw)


You are all wanting Crypto and Paypal but you know what would happen to the currency if that happens. The politicians are aware that you don’t trust the currency and that you will dump the dinar the second it happens.


You all want our country to live without debts yet some (ofc not all) take loans just for consumption and I see a bunch bragging. 

You are justifying illegal immigration yet you know that those immigrants will not only be poor hated but they will also ruin our reputation and that our country is the only in Africa that has a fertility rate below replacement. Gov does the same thing by taking little action to stop them.


Every Country gets the politician it deserves.
This is a statement that I here and that make sense. There are a lot of analogies between what random Tunisians do and what the government is doing(debts, negative speculation, non repatriation of immigrants) 


Now I expect people to tell me that I have no Idea and they willtalk to me about that poor guy that can barely make 20dt a day. Ok I don’t know but shouldn’t there be a change in the Tunisian mentality? 

The upper class and middle class specifically.

Also encourage people to become entrepreneurs  here rather than go abroad (even if I get it is tempting) brain drain is going to kill us.

Please read about this on the internet (How people get the leaders that they deserve especially since we have the democratic country if Kais doesn’t bring us behind morocco) and inform the others.

And Tunisians have a lot false stereotypes about the rest of the arab world but that ‘s whole other topic.

zkyduy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/zkyduy/looking_for_game_developers_and_graphic_designers/,16,Looking for Game developers and graphic designers for a Coming soon game studio.,"#1) Intro

Hi, 

Am doing a small initial study for a project (game dev studio) that I will launch next year with few partners. 

The 3 of us have great experience making mobile games, we helped creating titles that generated millions of $ per month, and though we are not ready to leave our current fulltime position yet, we are discussing the possibility of opening a small studio so we can test our knowledge with, and the current countries in discussion are : 

* Tunisia

* Portugal

* Bulgaria

* Estonia

* Morocco 

&amp;nbsp;

I am the Tunisian in the group (with one Aussi and one Saudi), and I am fully convinced that surely we can find 2 or 3 passionate game devs in this country.

I started working alone in 2012, and in 2016 [I posted here about my monthly income from freelancing](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/52xnyc/my_monthly_income_since_i_decided_to_start/) and last year i wrote [the freelancing faq](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/oh7kri/freelancing_faq_in_tunisia/) in this sub. 

Am saying this just to let you know that everything I did was done from my room, this year I worked in a game that reached the #1 chart in the US stores and my yearly bonus exceeds 100k Euro (beside my salary)


&amp;nbsp;

#2) What's the plan ?

We have a good budget, around 150k tnd just for development. 

The right industry-contacts for marketing and publishing. 

I have 10 years experience in mobile game programming and currently I am one of the 3 senior programmer working on a Live game that generates $200k/day, and my 2 other partners have a business background and mobile apps publishing.

With our expertise combined with the possible publisher partners we will have, we believe that a team of ~3 programmers and ~2 designers should be enough for the first year.

Also, i think its important to note that we are not starting right away, like i said this is just a little study am doing, I believe we should start by ~June 2023 

&amp;nbsp;

#2) Are we looking for cheap labor ? 

Nope, we are simply taking advantage of the the internet.

a $1000/month will have you living in poverty in the USA, but in Tunisia, Estonia or even Portugal, that's a very good salary for a non-senior programmer, and its *SUPERB* for a junior, which we are willing to pay if we find the right candidates.

&amp;nbsp; 

#3) What are you looking for ? 

**Programmers:**  

If you game dev is not already your main hobby, then this job is probably not for you. 

I don't care what degree you have (or don't have), I personally don't have any college degree, all we want is that you know how to solve problems in Unity/C# and you are willing to really learn. 

The minimum requirement is an itch.io account where you have published at least a couple of games, publishing on mobile is a huge plus.

&amp;nbsp;

**Designers:**  

It is really hard to find good ones, but initially we will mainly focus on Ui/Ux designers who are *VERY* familiar with Unity and can create Particles effect and animations and understand the Prefab workflow in the engine.

Imo, there is a big chance that the designers are going to be freelancers from other countries for the first year simply because we don't have a graphic expert in the team who will manage the ""learning process"" for this like I will be doing for the programmers.

&amp;nbsp;

3D folks, am sorry :( 

but unless we create a block-buster franchise, for the time being, everything that we might need can be purchased for less than a $100...


&amp;nbsp; 

#4) What are we offering ? 

I know that the most important thing is money, and our threshold will be set to 1200dt *Minimum* no matter what your level is (as long as you pass the minimum requirement of course), but we are willing to go as up as 4k/month if you deserve it. 

Like i said before, i spend 70% of my career freelancing and one the main thing i loved about it is how transparent everyone is about money, unlike the ""prix inbox"" bullshit that we suffer from in Tunisia, so the 
""la diversité contribue à la créativité"" crap in a job offer is not my kind shit lol.

I could tell you that you may be witnessing the birth of a future multi-million dollar company, bla bla bla, but you don't care and frankly you shouldn't, so fuck that, if you want to make games and didn't find a good job, i believe we can help with that, and after 2 or 3 years you can apply for Ubisoft or something lol 


#5) Remote or office ?? 


This is the key element that will let us choose Tunisia or not, frankly, the 3 of us are fully convinced that with the right team you can do wonders and have everyone working from the comfort of their home, my current team of 13 people for example are 100% remote, and this also apply to +80 other employees in our company.

This section is not just for game developer, but in general, are you willing to work from home ?

You will have the same work contract, etc... but you just won't be waking up everyday to go to the office. 

Also working from home come with a great advantage of choosing your own hours as long as you don't block the progress of the project and keep in sync with your teammates. 

It has many other disadvantages though and require a very strict mindset otherwise you will build up a lot of bad habits. 


#6) what's a fair salary in your opinion ? 

Please share what is your ideal (and realistic) salary based on experience, from Zero experience to 4 years XP, what's the salary should be for a programmer and a designer for every year ?

#7) [Optional] share your portfolio: 

It is SUPER EASY to find the programmers and designers work/portfolio when it comes to Portugal, Bulgaria and Estonia. 

It is incredibly hard to locate Tunisians and Moroccans online, seriously, this post aside, where the fuck are you lol ? there is a huge market when it comes to freelancing in IT and so far its super hard to find talents from these countries.

In my opinion its related to the dominant ""work in an office"" culture that still have you think in term of CV instead of an online-presence thanks to a portfolio.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyways, 

I hope this was detailed enough, looking for ward to hear your replies. 


Thanks for your attention.",,,,,,2022-12-13 15:26:13

حبيت كل مرة نطيش معلومة من الي قريتو لعل و عسى زوز او ثلاثة يصيرو يفهمو كيفي و انشالله خير مني.


فما حاجة إسمها هرمية قوانين، يعني في تونس عنا ياسر انواع متاع قوانين ( قوانين عادية، أساسية، معاهدات، دستور...)، و تنوع القوانين هذه يفرض وجود الهرمية و معناه ترتيب أنواع القاونين مالفوق لللوطا..
و منه، فالقانون الي اللوطة ماعندوش الحق يعارض و الا يتجاوز القانون الي فوقو باش نضمنو إستقرار قانوني في البلاد..


الهرمية هي كالآتي : 
1. دستور
2. الاتفاقيات و معاهدات الدولية 
3. القوانين الاساسية
4. القوانين العادية
5. الاوامر
6. القرارات


به شني يصير كيف أمر الي هو في المرتبة الخامسة مثلا يتعارض مع الدستور؟
- من المفروض ما يصيرش و نتجاوز هذا الأمر خاتر الأمر ما عندو حتى حل كان انو يخضع للدستور و كان تعارض من المفروض المحكمة الدستورية الي تم تعطيلها من 2014  توقف الامر يعني ما يتعداش و حاجات اخرى ما نكسرلكش راسك بها.


به، تو نمشيو للواقع المرير المعاش : قيس سعيد حسب الفصل 80 من دستور 2014 فعل حالة الإستثناء ( ما طبقش شروط الفصل بالصحيح )
و جمد مجلس النواب و ما وقفش العمل بالدستور الكل اما عمل امر 117 الي يظم مؤسسات البلاد بصفة مؤقتة و عوض يوقف العمل بدستور 2014 قال لا نخدمو بالتوطئة متع دستور 2014 و بالباب كذا و كذا عللللىىىىىى شرط ما يتعارضش مع الأمر الرئاسي هذا.


يعني شني صار لهرمية القوانين، في رحمة ربي.
يعني من المفروض الامر يخضع للدستور و المعاهدات و القوانين الأساسية و القوانين العادية ولى الدستور هيكل البلاد يخضع لمجرد امر، بالعكس يعني.",,,,,,2022-12-13 19:40:28

Solution M42 is one of the solutions that have worked for Tunisia in a parallel universe: let me know your thoughts, i spent loads of days analysing and researching, dont be harsh

(Those are not arranged steps)

\-choosing 42% of the population that is seen as not ''civilized'' enough (stealing and doing ''braqages'', sitting in cafes and waiting for an opportunity from the sky (waiting for cold bread), or those who are simply very simple minded that often leads to political influence or Jihad)

\-The specific people will be analysed by family background and will be sent to our beautiful south of Tunisia in a great complex to be re-instructed the true values of civilization (this worked in Argentina), learning about respect of the public environment (Tunisia is super dirty with 'un-educated people throwing shit everywhere, we are going to be like Bangladesh), respect of the values, history and 42% de-arabize the country.

\-The 42% of this people won't be brainwashed; instead, they'll know how to behave better and how to be determined to work for your country and help it thrive rather than being selfish. After all, we're all in this boat together.

\-the south of Tunisia will install there colonies and while the north of Tunisia may grow by the reasons below, there will find a point X in the middle (probably Sfax) to install a metropolis sector of industrialization, production and SPECIALLY ENTERTAINEMENTS.

\-Making Tunisia a secular state so our Jewish people from abroad can come again and re-establish a bit of economy, (in the late 42's Jews created an economic boom to the country), we need to promise them SAFETY, i know so many Tunisian Jews that would do anything to live in Tunisia if it was a better place

\-Make Tunisia more liberal so it attracts foreigners to STUDY, live and invest in the country, we need expats (it brings opportunities)

\-Ban the AK-47 rifles : this is mostly used by terrorists and developing countries mostly, the source is never clear, we are not commies.

\-Open more doors to Vysehrad group(Czechia,Hungary,Poland,SLovakia), Baltic countries and Singapore and the new east (diplomacy is the key, goddammit)

diplomacy&gt;relations&gt;cooperations&gt;investments&gt;jobs&gt;money&gt;growth

\-probably optional but creating a bridge between Tunisia and Sicily to connect to EUrope to us

let me know about your thoughts. do not be harsh.",,,,,,2022-12-14 01:23:35

2- الحالة الثانية :


 وقت العطلة البرلمانية ، البرلمان يرتاح شهر في العام، شنعملو نوقفو الدنيا ؟ لا، هنا رئيس الجمهورية او الحكومة عندهم الحق يخرجو مراسيم الي هي قوانين بصفة مؤقتة مابين البرلمان رجع.


===» في الحالتين، البرلمان كيف يرجع من العطلة و الا توفى حالة الإستثناء نوقفو إصدار المراسيم، و المراسيم الي صدرت في حالة الإستثناء فيثبتها البرلمان.. اذا باهية يردها قوانين و اذا لا مش باهية يلغيها و يتوقف العمل بها.


باه تو الواقع المرير المعاش كيف العادة : بما ان سعيد حل مجلس نواب الشعب الي هو السلطة التشريعية الي تصدر قوانين، لازم شكون يشرع و بما انها حالة استثناءءءء حسب كلامو الى إعتمد فيه الفصل 80 من دستور 2014 رئيس الجمهورية عطى لروحو حق إصدار المراسيم حتى إنتهاء حالة الإستثناء يعني حتى يجي مجلس نواب شعب جديد و نرجعو للحالة العادية، و هكا يولي قيس سعيد الي هو من الأول سلطة تنفيذية، حط في يدو السلطة تشريعية فرد وقت خلاف انو يتدخل في سلطة القضاء.

يعني بإختصار قيس تو تشرع القوانين و يسهر على تنفيذها و يتدخل في القضاء.

و المشكل الاخير، شني مصير المراسيم هذه مبعد، خاتر ما صدرتش بحكم تفويض من مجلس النواب، فهل هذا يعني انهي باش تقعد على قلوبنا ؟


الخلاصة اذا :

القانون خرجو البرلمان = قانون أساسي/ قانون عادي
القانون خرجو رئيس الجمهورية او رئيس الحكومة  = مرسوم / أمر (مش نفسهم)


و مش متأكد اذا في دستور 2022 اذا رئيس الحكومة مازال عندو صلاحية إصدار القوانين",,,,,,2022-12-14 11:17:05

What do u do for living? How’s your social life in Tunisia? 
I’ve been here since 2019 and it’s been really hard when it comes to socialising (friends mostly)… even harder with finding a job. 

I’m a female (22). My social life is terrible in here. I’ve always had mostly male friends back in my hometown,few girlfriends. But here? No one. I always go out with my spouse and his friends. I mean they are amazing and funny-they are my friends too. But it’s not like we can go out heads up for a coffee and chat. 
Guy friends are out of question now but what about girls? 
Anytime I try to interact with girls they give me death stare. Even if I’m just sitting, minding my own business they stare with disgust in their eyes. I don’t get it. I try to smile and shit be nice but nothing.

When it comes to working it’s worse! Literally can’t find a job for myself. I would expect at least working when I have zero social life lol. I’m so bored. Do u guys have any tips of where to start or what should I look for? I mean my work experience is not bad. I’ve studied clothing design but I’ve done many different jobs. Last summer I worked for a Czech travel agency (wasn’t bad but not a cup of my tea). The season ended in September.

I will try to tell you everything and I will try to be concise.

So, I've started watching pornography when I was around 17 years old, that is about 8 years ago, and back-then, I was frankly enjoying it, it was free, available, it enabled me to enjoy myself and distract me from getting stuck in any sort of relationships because I was back then sort of reserved and antisocial. Most importantly, I had control over my porn consumption and masturbation was only a healthy practice for me, unlike now, it the umbrella word for my struggle.

During college, I started to meet many attractive people, and my sexual urges went up to the sky, but being alone and incapable of engaging with the people I was interested in made me crumble into my shell and fantasize. I did that for a long time. Initially, it was a relief for me because I was liberating my sexual desires at the lowest costs. But then, I started to think about masturbation and porn almost all the day. I meet a new person and I think about sex, I meet a friend and I think about sex, I meet a new colleague and I think about sex. All these thoughts translated later into masturbation and pornography consumption and I found out that I have totally lost control. I was therefore addicted.

I tried to get into challenges like nofap, I would stay away from porn and masturbation for 7 days, 2 weeks, a month, but during these times my urges intensify, and that's the reason I relapsed. And every time I relapse, massive negative thoughts and sadness waves hit me, negative self-talk and low self-esteem.

I wanted to be with someone but my self-image is so bad it tells me that I'm mentally insane, incapable of handling my instincts and a filthy person to be around. My masturbation addiction was driving me crazy and baptizing me into depression. I remember one day I was watching porn and I bursted into crying because it was out of control and I was tired asking myself why I am doing this.

There are days when I feel a slight espoir that I can change, and I try to stop watching porn for some time. I install porn blocker on my phone and on my browsers, and feel quite good for a bit of time, but again, I relapse and there's the slippery slope of negativity again. I feel that I am broken beyond measure, addicted beyond repair, and I can not share my struggle with anyone because I feel too shameful about it. 

I need help. I'm drained by this addiction, I'm tired of being alone. I am planning on seriously retaking the journey of nofap again, and I want to ask:

° Tips to get over sexual thoughts
° Tips to disable porn on devices
°Quantifiable measures to regain confidence in myself.
° Tips to control sexual urges while having no partner.",,,,,,2022-12-15 13:28:34

I decided to send the money from the US account in Wise to my tunisian bank account via SWIFT.  
Initially, Wise charged me a transfer fee of approximately $15. The money that was supposed to reach my bank is $1625. I am also aware that banks may charge some additional fees but what surprised me is that, when I received the money and checked my account, I noticed that the amount which is missing is approximately 300 TND.  
I know that currency conversion rates vary from one provider to another, and at the same time, when I checked how much $1640 would be equal in TND, it was around 5200 TND (That's because at that time 1 USD was approximately 3.21 TND, of course that changes frequently). BUT, no matter how variable it is, there are some limits. When I investigated the database with an agent within the bank agency that I go to, I saw that the central bank issued a treasury rate of 3.04. That means that they made $1 = 3.04 TND, which is way too low. I still don't understand how and why all of this happened, can someone elaborate?",,,,,,2022-12-15 14:51:27

So whats the solution? In the search for political stability, and economic prosperity Tunisia should first install a one party system resembling the one in China through a second revolution, this time the revolution shouldnt stop after the army takes controll (we all know what happened in Egypt). Second a new army should be made, this army should be large with every male being obliged to do service, this army would protect the constitution. Third Tunisia should help insure peace in libya with a freindly invasion, this would put an end to the civil war and later they can join us in a union, this would help the tunisian economy due to Libya's high petroleum reserves, in addition to natural gas and phosphate.

While doing my Investigation I found the EEG of Germany from 2004, the EEG or ""Erneuerbare Energien Gesetz"" is basically the law revolving mostly around renewable energy and most things relating to that in Germany, the EEG 2000 and 2004 being only a few pages long had set definitions for what renewables are, and most importantly its incentives like the feed-in tariff, that renewable subsidy has then let for a massive renewable industry in Germany to form which had in 2011 its peak at 300,000 Employees.   


Does Tunisia have such a similar State Investment Program? and if not, why does it not commence such through subsidies and feed-in tariff incentives with the goal of industrial development?   


Another Question is about the general economic development in Tunisia, many months ago I have read the Book ""how Asia works"" by joe Studwell, it talks about how the Asian Tigers industrialized during certain periods of time and how they used such things called Export Discipline (basically export-oriented industrialization and subsidizes) to industrialize, including that land reform and so on.   


Did Tunisia ever have a Land Reform? Or required one to incentive agriculture and then industrial development? Did it also ever use state industrial policy and investments like Export Discipline to form state industries in a few sectors and subsidizes them to export to the world and develop? Yes No? Would be generally interesting to hear why!   


Anyway, thanks for the Answers! Would love to discuss/know it!",,,,,,2022-12-16 13:42:38

when I told my friend about this, she told me that ""I should get used to it, it's about making acquiantances not necessarily friends, and that's how things are gonna be in the professional life"". the mere idea is making me miserable, I really can't imagine my life with people like that.

Also, how realistic is it to find someone to drive us to Tunis and what might that cost? $50-100? 


Finally, I want to say a big thank you to Tunisians. I wasn't sure what to expect of Tunisia. I have been to Algeria, Morocco and Egypt before and the experiences were all quite varied.

This is my story, I feel in love with this girl and I may say that she is my soulmate. We vibe and really get each other and I really believe the feelings were both ways. Therefore, I took the leap and decided to ask her to be my gf (not just for a casual dating because she is THE ONE and I'm willing for something serious). And since day one, I made sure that she knows about every little detail about me and I just kept one for myself (or when the right time comes)

The day we went on a date, everything went as expected and since I'm willing for something serious I told her about my secret that I kept from her. I told her that I'am atheist and really it was hard to swallow that she cried her eyes out. 

I will not bother you with details, but the actual situation is that she's still thinking deeply about it (she has mixed feelings between not to lose me and how to deal with it since the religious type)

I know this is a big deal but in my opinion, if two people love each other, they may come to understanding each other and they sure will find a way to coexist together this is how i see it because what matters most to me is that mutual connection you reach with someone precious and everything else comes second.

I'm a family gal, I like to think I care for Tunisia more than average and I'm too introverted and individualistic to crave the developed countries lifestyle the way most Tunisians seem to do. Sure, I don't connect with 99% of the community here, but, I know I won't anywhere else.

&amp;#x200B;

The country I'm planning to settle in is not on my dream destination list, but, it has study/work opportunities that I can get behind; I'd be alone and I don't mind that though the risk sure exists.  
And I believe I can make my country 0.00001% better by staying here and I'll be better for it, though it'll take me at least a decade longer to achieve some of my goals.

&amp;#x200B;

Could you, hopefully from experience, weigh out pros and cons of living abroad based on my kind of personality. And convince me to stay or go with arguments that don't involve the words ""hej"", ""t7arrar"", ""ma yoslo7 fiha chay"", ""tdhaya3 7yetek"", and all that ri9.

But for some reason, since late October, it fucking vanished from every shelf, I tried everywhere, any store you can think of, nobody has it..

As for those who DID have it, I contacted them about any possibility of restocking, but nada. All I get is ""we're not restocking that item"" or the absolute gem ""We have USB 2.0""!

I honestly find it weird that this particular product is unavailable in every single store I look, it's like scalpers do with 80 series GPU's and PS5's..

Which Google translates to:

zu1bqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/zu1bqi/can_a_democratic_regime_be_applicable_in_tunisia/,3,Can a democratic regime be applicable in Tunisia?,"Okay hear me out:

- The west, after hundreds of years of trial and error, have come up with their idea of a good regime, which is a democratic regime that respects individuals and grants freedom to all people. It mainly consists of the choice of the political leaders by the people.

These nations are also highly educated. The whole population is well educated meaning that their choice in elections is somewhat an educated one, meaning less frauds are getting into the political scene.

- On the other hand, we are a nation that is part of a group of nations that never tried any form of freedom in the last few hundred years. Plus we are among the least educated people on earth. Our educational system is one of the worst, and education is not even accessible to everyone. Studies after primary school are becoming a luxury. The majority of the people are not properly educated. Above all of this, we are dirt poor. A fucking economical and intellectual distaster we are.


In the last few years, we've discovered that democracy, as beautiful as it sounds, may not after all be applicable on our country. Why?


Whether you like it or not, we are a population that is ignorant and hungry. We simply cannot form a legitimate opinion on a political problem. Let me give you a small example:


 Imagine you are very hungry and desperate, lost in a village that you don't know. You find many people that you don't know that have food, and that are willing to give you some. You are excited to finally get food, but these people, as a return, want you to do favors for them. As you don't know these people, you are simply ignorant to their bad intentions, as they are asking returns that may be dangerous for you. But you're desperate, hungry, and can't make a reasonable choice. They are literally exploiting your weakness and ignorance. You'll never do a rational choice.


This is exactly what we, as a population, are experiencing in my opinion. We simply cannot be given the choice as we are not mentally and physiologically healthy. We are dangerous to ourselves. You don't let your 3-year old decide for his future.

On the other hand, going back to dictatorship would make us more ignorant and hungry.

What's the solution? Can you suggest a good political model that can be applied? Even some ideas, not some sciences po shit. 

 Please discuss respectfully. And please do not suggest a religious solution on the matter, nor discuss any religious opinion. Thank you.",,,,,,2022-12-24 04:09:04

Tbh I don't use it much anyways(besides in vacation ofc),when I first bought I thought I would play with a bunch of my friends but that didn't happen and my ping made online games off the table so I'm stuck with pirating offline games.

And I didn't partake in the info section so I don't think it has much use for me outside of gaming(especially since I'm 3eme math so I don't have much time for gaming/using the PC)

How much would you advise me to sell it for If I were to sell it ?
And should I sell it and buy a laptop since it will help me in case of transportation (on one hand I will lose a lot of money selling it but on the other head I can't use it for university since it would be a hassle to transport especially if I can make it into another country)

I'm thinking maybe I'm overthinking since the excitement of me first buying it has worn off so idk

Edit:I'm going to mention the specs for more details on how much I should sell the PC .

CPU:AMD RYZEN 5 3600X+CPU FAN(forgot the name,not the one included with the CPU)

GPU:RTX 2060 SUPER

STORAGE:240GO SSD+ 1 TO HDD

POWER SUPPLY:COOLER MASTER 650W +80 BRONZE 

Monitor:MSI 165HZ 27 inch

Mouse: logitech g302

Keyboard:redragon k552

Headset: Redragon h301

Gamepad:MSI GC30

Edit 2: I'm kinda split ,on one hand I would've lost a lot of money by selling it and on the other hand a gaming laptop would be much more for studying if I make it abroad but if I don't make it abroad it wouldn't be that much of a hassle in case of transportation .
I'm thinking of selling it in the 3000/3400 dt price range if I were to sell it.
Also If I were to sell it,it would be in the near future coz if I were to wait after BAC It would lose more of its value",,,,,,2022-12-25 17:36:02

I mean obviously, there is a lot of extreme ppl in Arab countries but they always keep a low profile and never discuss their extremism proudly and loudly and all.

edit :
since a lot of ppl asking for examples of Ali dawah and similar preachers saying stuff that can be considered extreme by zaitouna mosque licensed preachers I'm gonna edit this post to include clips of examples of what I'm talking about throughout the day, (keep in mind that these clips can be hard to find so updating this post with links will be a slow process).

Ali dawah supporting and calling for death penalty for Muslim reverts :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqnvMG6G5Ho

Ali dawah spent 16 mins trying to excuse rape in-between married couples by implying that it's wrong Islamically but it's also wrong for women to deny their husband sex cause ""it's oppression against the husband"" and then turns it into a gender conversation by saying that it's wrong for men to deny their wife sex too by referencing a weak 7adith:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgIXrzj4c50

Ali dawah saying that if his daughter would reach puberty at 9 he would say she is ready for marriage unless she disagrees :

But what if the wife never wanted to marry the husband in the beginning, but she was pressured into the marriage by her family. The wife and the husband don’t have compatible personalities. They always argue. The wife resents her marriage and life with him for the past 25 years. The husband never hit her or cheated on her. The wife hates the husband and never appreciates anything he does for her. The wife has a lot of assets in money and could afford to live on her own after a divorce. Would most of their Tunisian relatives talk them out of divorcing if this couple wanted to divorce?

I just arrived in Tunis yesterday, escaping the British cold weather. Hoping to stay a while if possible. I love Tunis so far, btw!

If anyone could offer some advice, it'd be greatly appreciated.

From experience so far, it seems wifi can be pretty unreliable here. What's the best sim card/data deal available for a foreigner who will be on his laptop a lot. 

Also, it it worth getting an internet dongle as an alternative to hotpotting?

I'd love to travel around the country a bit in a few weeks, probably very slowly - at least a couple weeks in each destination. Any recommendations of where to go? I'm keen to avoid places that are 'resorty' and not sure whether Hammamet falls into that category?

Oh, one cultural question. I like to run and would usually wear shorts/t-shirt - is it culturally frowned upon to show legs in public, even when exercising? Should i buy some jogging bottoms?

Anyway, any help appreciated! And Happy New Year :)",,,,,,2022-12-31 09:58:43

I want to know if any freelancers get paid on Upwork or companies outside Tunisia, how do you get your money into the country and spend it,

I am looking for a solution to minimize taxes and be able to keep the money in EUR/USD in order to spend it abroad.

  
Do you have to create a SARL (or another type n company)? Do you use your own personal bank account or the company's?

Do you get your money in EUR/USD (compte en devise) or do you have to convert it to TND to spend it?

How do you pay taxes on that money ? Do you have any contact for a trusted Accountant?
