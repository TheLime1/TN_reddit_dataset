18wuybm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/18wuybm/the_most_unluckiest_thief_in_the_history_of/,9,The most unluckiest thief in the history of Tunisia,"I was gonna call him the stupidest, but this guy was not stupid by any means, he was as close to a real-life ninja as I've ever witnessed. But he didn't know, at the time, that his luck had long run out and he was running on empty.

It was a peaceful spring night in a peaceful city, and a taxi driver noticed someone working on a car in front of a mechanic's shop. The driver happens to know the owner so he called him up, asking if he had someone working this late and it didn't take long for everybody to recognize that a car was being stolen.

The driver, along with his passenger, a young man, dared to chase the thief who took off running until he reached our neighborhood.

We live in an apartment complex that is 5 stories high, the thief ran to the other one which is identical to ours. He went to the back side to hide, then climbed a window steel frame and onto the second balcony.

Upon hearing footsteps, the mom living there got out of her bedroom to check, she came face to face with the thief and chased him out bravely. A fierce mother you may think, but it's more than that, let me assure you. Her husband woke only a few seconds later but the thief was already gone.

By then, the building was already surrounded by policemen, it only took 2 minutes!

The thief went upstairs and onto the roof of the building. Then, and here comes the ninja part, he climbed down by grabbing the pipes to the side of the building and into a bathroom window. It was because he knew that by staying on the roof, he would just get himself cornered.

The father living there heard him and chased him out of that window. Everybody was aware by then so everyone kept checking their apartment. The ninja guy had no problem climbing down another two stories by grabbing said pipes, but he got exposed just as fast. 

It was at that moment, that he decided that his best chance was to jump to the compound next to the building and then make a run for it. The compound had a relatively high fence so the cops won't be able to chase him right away as he jumped, and that's what he did.

He jumped from a height of three stories, that's around 10 meters. And as you might've guessed, he broke something. The cops found him hiding under some stairs. He couldn't run at all.

The cops immediately transferred him to the capital for investigation as he seemed to have received some kind of training. 

Back to the mom who chased him out, she is, in fact, a trained cop. Her husband too. The father who found the thief in the bathroom? Yes, he's a cop too. Same for the residents of the other apartment in the third story. In short, all the residents were cops. And this thief thought he could just hide there.

You know the compound we talked about earlier? That's the main police station in the city. He jumped into the parking lot and then hid under some stairs. Maybe he noticed that there were a little too many police cars in the parking lot by then.

It was just a short walk to the investigation room. 

And that's how the most unluckiest thief in the history of Tunisia got caught and I don't think I will ever witness as much heavy-duty bad karma in one single night.

18wolw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/18wolw7/arabic_to_english_poem_translation_issue/,4,Arabic to English poem translation issue,"  

I've been dating a Tunisian man, who is claiming to have written the below poem for me:

عيناك نجوم ساحرة وهادية .. ضحكتك آسرة وعاتية .. ونبرة صوتك كأنها سياط قاسية .. وحنيني اليك كأنه امواج عنيفة وضارية .. مثالية انتِ وكأنك من الألماس مصنوعة .. وعلى تراب الجنة موضوعة .. وبالإستبرق والسندس ملفوفة ومرفوعة .. حقا مثالية .. بعيونك العسلية .. التي عندما انظر اليك تلقيان علي التحية .. عيون ليس كمثلها عيون .. صوّرها فأحسن تصويرها الله الحي القيوم .. فلا شيئ مثل صنعه سبحانه يخلق ما يشاء وانت عندي ابهى من القمر والنجوم .. تربعتِ على عرش قلبي ببساطتك .. وفرشتي في قلبي بساطك .. واكلتِ وشربتِ ونمتِ وكأنه بلاطك .. ولأبد الدهر سيبقى قلبي ارض ميعادك

As I don't know Arabic I have used Google translate and called him out on بعيونك العسلية because Google translates is to 'your hazel eyes' - I have blue eyes 🙃 I have freaked out a little, thinking that he wrote it for someone else/copied it for somewhere and forgot to change the eye colour. However, his response was: ""unlike in English, in Arabic we can use words to describe things differently, so honey doesn't have to mean colour but can also be used to describe sweetness"" - can anyone confirm if this is true in this case? I have checked the word العسلية in an online dictionary and it comes up with results like sugar, honey, honeymoon and honey-like, however I'm not sure if I believe him lol. Any help will be greatly appreciated, thanks :)","It goes more with color than sweetness but he's still right about it, it can mean sweetness and he added the honey thing instead of anything else just for the rythm, maybe..","It can mean sweetness, especially in this poem because it's easier to use ""عيونك العسلية"" to make it rhyme with the other verses.",It could be just to make it rhyme,He's cheating on you,"Honestly, since your eyes are blue, one could have been more creative and mentioned the sea.

My mom estimated it to be around 500ish trees(land wise) between me and my aunt 
No trees are planned .
I want to be aware of this business at my age (20) because i don't really believe in ky parents that they can grow it as a business
They will pretty much collect olive ,turns it into oil,sell it, keep the money until death.
My question is , is it really profitable and can my family mak a fortune out of it and it is really a business  and how much time will it take (ik it takes time)",Its profitable depends... kade emarhom el chojrat ou l5adema ml family yani entoum cht5dmo wala tjibo chkoun ou tnsech li zitoun iji 3am saba ou 3am re9ed ou 3am er9ad i7eb barcha mè ou lahwa kn andk chkoun ml 3aila wala tarf chkoun yefhm fima esel.

I'd say after substructing el ma3sra w khedmet el jam3an you will keep approximately 2/3 as a profit.","Its  profitable depends on where u live, for example u will have to drive to the country side where ur land is each week to check (3la eser9a, famma elli yeteada bel 8lam mte3ou yekloulek echajrat,famma s8ar 3adi ykasrou 3wed bch yela3bou,etc.) So keep in mind gas money.

Moreover, 3andk el ektife2 edheti, since u gonna start such project u will have to keep a quantity for urself (olives or olive oil) cuz u will see tht the prices will always go up so u wont have to buy any more, u can just provide for urself and ur family (also depends on ur family members, and since i assume u dont have the ability to stop ur family from donating to ur uncles and aunts it might not be able to be as profitable as u expect)

Happy New Year to all!

I'm a 24-year-old man who spent the last 6 months living abroad after graduating. However, I've decided to take a different path in life. With my new 100% remote job, I'll be spending the next year in Tunisia.

Currently, I'm back living with my parents, but I constantly feel lonely and depressed. It's challenging to make real connections or meet people with similar interests here,  not having a car and living in a poor neighborhood have made it worse.

Can you recommend some chill places where I can engage in fun activities and meet people of the same age group ?","To meet people with same ""interest"" as you, you have to go to the places where they'll be interested in. Let me explain: if you're interested in meeting people who are into health and fitness join a gym/martial art club. If you're into nature you can join also a running or hiking or camping group(those are starting to be come popular on fb in Tunisia last few years)
If you're into computer science, attend coding competitions, hackathons and tech conferences.
Other than that make sure you go outside as much as possible go work in public coffees or public libraries as much as possible. The more time you spend outside the more likely to meet people. Strike up conversations with strangers whenever possible and adequate (you'll be surprised how many people will be responsive and welcoming that)
And know that making new connections is always a challenge at the beginning.","Mmmmm If you’re like some tourist all the country is open. I would recommend doing all of it. But if you had to choose Djerba or Tabarka would be my choices. 

Have fun


But a great Idea for a full year might be to go all around the coast that could be interesting. And all the major cities are there anyways",,,,2024-01-01 18:12:09

- using and abusing the working class in every possible way , from the lousy salaries to the hazards and risks they put their employees on ( nse elli tatla3 fil kmayen men teli for example)

Me (from Slovakia) and my fiancé (Tunisia) - together 2years will have wedding at February. First we will go only to baladyia (February) and in June we will have party with both families and friends :) Iam pretty excited! 🫶🏾 I have couple of questions (of course I asked my fiancé and my friends also in Tunisia) but I want to ask more people! 
First of all I love Tunisia (especially food is delicious 🌶️). 
• any tips what to do and what better not to do on party and in baladyia? 
• in Tunisia bride has a lot of makeup and red lips -  I’m not using a lot of makeup (I hate it 🥶)  and also red lipstick is not my favorite. 
• can I dance on party? Cause in Europe we are dancing all night together with family, friends. But in Tunisia I saw a lot of videos that bride and groom they are only siting. I want to enjoy every minute. 
• can I have witness (a woman) on baladyia? 
• it’s okay to put only little amount on my face? 
• what about dresses to baladyia? I want to rent or buy something like this: is it possible to rent/buy it near Monastir or Mahdia ? 🫶🏾(on photos is not me haha, Iam blond)  if you have contact or recommendations I will be so happy. Thank you to all and have a nice start to New year ❤️","Congratulations!
First of all, it’s your wedding so don’t do anything you’re unhappy with. My wife didn’t like the Geisha-makeup either so she had normal makeup and none of us liked the sitting part so we did that just for the photos and spent the evening partying with our guests. 

I believe most people choose something less heavy than the traditional wedding dresses for the townhall ceremony. What has been popular recently are suits inspired by traditional dresses. You’ll find quite a few businesses that specialize in that if you search in FB, IG, TikTok.

One last consideration: it is easier to get married in your (EU) country of residence and get the marriage registered in Tunisia than the other way around.","Hey OP congrats !! First, do not forget it is your wedding and especially as the bride you should do what's on your mind ! For the makeup part, tunisian girls tend to go to professional make-up artists, but a lot of them are not great, and that explains the ""heavy"" makeup. You can do your own makeup, or you can also book a more skilled makeup artist (I recommend ""feryel studio"" or ""lobna ben ammar"" if your wedding is in Tunis).
Of course you can dance and party all night long, the sitting part is really outdated and usually only done for photos and for resting between dances ! As for the witness in baladeya, it can be a woman without any problem.
I would add one advice regarding alcohol, some tunisian families consume it openly in weddings, some prefer to hide it, some forbid it completely, so you should discuss it with your fiance beforehand and inform your own family about that.",what's on your head,Mistake: I'm not using a lot of makeup (I hate it ) and also red lipstick is not my favorite it's okay to put only little amount on my face? 🤟🏾,,2024-01-01 12:44:26

Last summer we passed engineering school entrance exam and got accepted to the same university,and , you guest it, same class.
We started to talk sometimes and at that point i didn't have feelings for her, 2/3 months later , we started to be much closer, spent the lunch break together, go to the library almost everyday and study,
She is so charming and have a good personality and i really think we are compatibility,
The thing is, she is so flirty, she sometimes says things or act in a certain way like she is giving hints, idk if it is only with me or im just making this up as an excuse to make things work with her, she also wanted me to keep her relationship a secret because no one knows she has a BF(cz of a new uni)
I really like her but I don't want to confess or do anything, I know for a fact i ll be rejected and our friendship will be ruined, added to that things will be awkward as I can't avoid her(same classe), and she is also in a relationship and I don't want to be a douch
Talking about texting now, I really want to talk for hours and share things, but we almost talk about studying or if the conversation shif to another subject she almost left me on seen or never respond, when I do the same behavior and Tell her she do the same she denies it
The question is how can I keep a distance from her?
I tried a bit through muting the messenger notifications and responding late

(-) Terrible bureaucracy. Horrendous visa/residency policy. Lots and lots of stalling. Relatively restrained market opportunities compared to the rest of the EU. Also relatively stingier wages unless you're studying something that will pay a fixed rate regardless of country (accounting, finance, swe).

(+) beautiful country. Warm weather. Tolerable people.

\-- Go the agency route. They'll take care of everything. Spain is hardly known for its academics lmao.

\>Hungary

(+) Your most foolproof shot on account of the yearly scholarship. Lot's of Tunisians been there done that. Lot's of coverage (information). Lot's of testimonies. 

Beautiful country. Rich history. Abundant culture.

(-) Intelligible language. Central European shithole. Not in the Shenghen zone.

(+) Beautiful country. Great infrastructure. Great academics in NTNU etc. Possible scholarships.

(-) Another soulless Scandinavian antisocial rut. Bsc's are taught in Norwegian. Dubious visa allocation prospects.

French is our second language and it's the language you should be using to be understood MOST of the time, as few people outside the hotel will understand English much less form understandable sentences using it.

As for the hotel , french is preferable, and I know from my experience working summer jobs as a hotel waiter that most waiters know just enough English to greet you , serve you  joke around and maybe some chit chat.
TL:DR French","Depends on the place and age of the person you’re talking to, if you’re addressing staff at a hotel or people over 25 go for french. 

If you’re asking directions from a teenager or a young adult you might wanna use English, French might work too tho.

For   A year or so everyone was joyful and everyone felt proud to be Tunisian for once.
I remember  that performance impacted us so much that a-lot of my peers decided to pursue a handball career . Every child and teenager was dreaming about being a hanballer.

One of them   Was my childhood friend  who after ,wissem Hmam scored his famous 360 turn goal , told he will be  as good as him when he grows up, i have seen  from his facebook  posts that he is still playing the game  for a club in the second division , but it still made smile he followed his dream","Yeah, I still remember when we finished at 4th place at the 2005 world cup. Wissem Hmem, Heykel Mgannem, Issam Tej, Sahbi Ben Aziza & company gave us a world cup full of exciting and unforgettable memories. I was 14 years old back then. During that period, as a Tunisian living abroad, I remember going to school holding my held high and feeling so proud and exited because I came from a country with such strong national teams, both in football and handball, and I knew that all of my friends had witnessed their strength as well, and were going to talk to me about it. This was my oxygen and my cryptonite. These were the things I literally lived for. 

It began with our football team taking home the winning trophy of CAN 2004, followed by the outstanding performance of our handball team at the 2005 world cup, and then our football team qualifying for the 2006 world cup. Those really were the golden days for Tunisian sports and I have never felt nearly as proud to be a Tunisian from a sports perspective as I did back then.

\*How realistic is this idea? how hard is it to land a remote job in Tunisia if have some good English communication skills.

\*given our country that makes every thing hard, is it even legal, if it is what's the paper work required to do it

\*wouldn't foreign currency transfers from other countries rase some suspicions among the Tunisian banks?

\*does any one have experience in remote jobs and do they pay well if converted to Tunisian dinar?

any answer would be mush appreciated, feel free to burst my dream bubble if necessary :) thanks! <3","Every office jobs will be automated in the next 10 years, don't worry.",I think the hard part(if everything else goes well) would be the method of paying you.,"Data entry clerking might not be the most future-proof career choice. It's not meant to discourage you, but the reality is that the demand for this job is not very high, even in Western countries. The skills required for data entry are not advanced, making it susceptible to automation.

In fact, a significant portion of data entry tasks is already being taken over by AI, specifically through computer vision. This shift is happening rapidly and is expected to continue. Around 80% of such tasks are already automated, providing a more reliable and cost-effective solution.

I'm not saying this to offend you, but rather to encourage you to consider expanding your skillset and exploring other career options. It's a good idea to proactively look for opportunities that align with future trends and technological advancements. It's about ensuring your long-term career stability and growth.

The tradition of parading a doll around the village during drought is common among Berbers. Search [Anzar](https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A3%D9%86%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%B1) for more information on it, it exists among all sedentary Berbers all over the Maghreb.

The tradition on the other hand is absent in the Levant. Lebanese people don't have it, Syrians don't have it, Palestinians don't have it. The only group in the Middle East who have something that is vaguely similar are Kurds and that probably was an independent development.

That's not to mention that we have exactly 0 evidence Phoenicians and/or Cannanites practiced anything similar. Levantine rain making rituals evolved into what we today know as the Dabke, they are totally different from Omok Tangou/Anzar.

So tell me, in light of this evidence, what is more likely : That Omok Tangou is just an evolution of an already existing Berber tradition, or a remnant of a Punic tradition of whom no evidence for its existence ?",2023-12-31 12:29:31

Get a driver license. Rules are the same except that you can make a right turn on red lights. He would also need to rent a car the day of the driving test after he passes the written one ( y3addi el code ). All this happens at the DMV: Department of Motor Vehicles. They’ll give him a doc to be able to rent a car with of course.

18u3ens,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/18u3ens/cultural_differences_between_tunisia_compared_to/,12,Cultural differences between Tunisia compared to Morocco,"What are some cultural differences between Tunisia and Morocco? Both are touristic, North African, former- french colonies. While Algeria is likely a blend of the two, are there any notable differences between Tunisia and Morocco in terms of their dialect, food, culture etc. 

Many Thanks", What you call bread,"Dialect is very different, not to the point of being completely intelligible but quite so for an untrained ear. Tunisian has more romance words and pronunciation compared to moroccan also some base words have different etymology, meaning and not quite the same history and language mix before the French came.

Food is different. Moroccan food is more based on sweet-savory combination and spices such as cinnamon or rad el hanout which are not used at all in Tunisian cuisine. Tunisian cuisine is based on tomatoes, peppers, olive oil, thyme/tabil, harissa and fish/seafood for the most part giving it a ressemblance to Italian cuisine (especially Sicily).

Culture wise, Tunisian are more foul mouthed on average, Tunisia is not a monarchy and very anti monarchy while Moroccans are on average very supportive of monarchy. Moroccans are also on average more conservative than Tunisians on religious and nationalist aspects. Some other differences are berber language and nationalism, nigh inexistant in Tunisia while almost 50% of moroccan population belongs to an active berber tribe and its a big topic in morocco. Also Tunisia is in the middle if the Mediterranean while Morocco is on the Atlantic, and while Morocco would focus more on the middle ages (al andalus) in its national history, Tunisia would focus more on Antiquity (Carthage) where the notion of the Mediterranean world and the importance of the geographical location of Tunisia is more emphasized giving a different outlook on the modern world.","Tunisia is less religious and more Mediterranean in terms of the culture, food, and ambiance. 

The food is decently different, Tunisian food being tomato sauce + Harissa based, while Moroccan can have a less spicy+ sweet/savory tones. 

Morocco is also different due to having the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Tunisia has the Mediterranean as the main historical + cultural influence, plus proximity to Italy.

Requirement (Tunisia): 

* Tax Id (Batinda)
 * if you do it as a ""personne physique"" you won't pay taxes (at least it was like that the last time i checked)
 * (contant an accountant for more information, the whole thing will cost you 500~1k tnd depending on your city)

* Use that Tax Id to open a bank account
 * this is necessary so that when you receive the money and Central Bank goes ""ija 3aych weldi"" (they will do it through your bank not directly to you)

 * You then send the Apple receipts to your banker and the banker will unfreeze the money. 


&nbsp;

Requirement (Apple):

* https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/getting-paid/overview-of-receiving-payments/

Advice: 

* Don't over complicate it 
 * I knew a dozen of people who chickened out of ideas like this and/or freelancing because ""L'bled msakra sa7bi"", it is not. 


&nbsp;

* Don't deal personally with Tn administration
 * Get an an accountant! you have no idea how easy your life will be with them.



&nbsp;

* Don't be a cheap fuck
 * You have to spend money to make money, the initial 500~1k you need to get started legally is a must-pay and it should be negligeable compared to the amount your are planning to make. 

 * No one will ever know about your App if you don't pay for User Acquisitions (Ads), so you better start looking for a solution on how to do that too, 

 * the 1k of ""Carte technologique"" can be a first step, and with the ""batinda"" you can turn it into 10k. 

 * And if you're good and know what you're doing, your bank will give you more, but this is not an ""a3mel matleb"" situation, you need to have contacts and prove that you can make steady USD/Euro income with that bank

I actually left the country due to the horrible salaries.","Guys, can you specify what y’all doing for living? Because these expenses are HUGE lol.","I live with my girlfriend and we spend  3000-3500 broken as follows:

1.1k rent and  bills


600 groceries 

400 dates and going out

500 cars  and fuel ( we got two cars)

400 clothes

100 tnd for vape

18tg3kp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/18tg3kp/moving_to_tunis_as_a_tunisian_born_abroad/,18,Moving to Tunis as a Tunisian born abroad,"Hey y’all! Ever since I started a remote job I’ve been considering temporarily relocating to tunis for a  few months to perhaps a year.

For context, I’m 22 (F) born in Canada. I’ve visited tunisia on multiple occasions, speak darija but it’s slightly broken (I understand it fluently tho). My main motivation really is that I want to experience life in Tunisia at least once in my life, improve my Arabic, and make Tunisian friends (I literally don’t have any 😭).

Although I have family in nabeul/siliana I’m thinking that it would be nice to live on my own in the capitol, tunis. I wouldn’t want to stay with my extended family because they live on remote farms and the wifi is awful 😭😭 also I’ve lived abroad in europe by myself, so this wouldn’t be a first for me. 

I just really don’t know how to go about finding a studio or a temporary rental especially when I’m in Canada at the moment. I also don’t know anything about tunis, the safe areas to live, or if moving to tunis is even realistic. I’ve never been to tunisia by myself and would never venture anywhere without my parents. I feel as though people might take advantage of the fact that I really don’t know much about how things work, especially considering that I’m a girl. 

I’m wondering what you guys think and if you have any tips with finding a good place to live considering im abroad !","A couple of things to consider :

1 * Trust no one until they prove they are trust worthy. Unfortunately, for too many people you are not a person, you are a green card who will put out. I'm soory for the vulgar image but it is what it is. Be very worry of others, especially young man your age.

2 * Any middle class neighbourhood can work for you. Before you sign a lease visit the place at night to figure out what is what. Some places I suggest : La marsa, Sidi Bousiid, Carthage, Jardin Carthage, Manzah ( 1, 5, 6, 7,8 or 9), Jardin Manzah, El manar, Nasr (Ariana)...
You are looking at anything from 600 to 1000 tnd per month (200 to 300 usd).

3* No matter where you live, a car is essentiel. Cars are super expensive (high import taxes). A brand new ""toy"" starts at around 40 to 50k tnd (15ish k usd). You can get away with taking cabs or ""bolt"" (our version of uber). It will cost around 1 tnd (0.3 usd) per km for regular cabs and around 1.5 tnd (0.5 usd) per km for ""bolt"".","Probably places like Marsa and Carthage will fit you,( if this is the first time you live in tounes) you'll love it there. Marhbe bik:)","I lived my entire life in Tunisia, and now after living abroad for 10 years, I feel that it's very difficult for me to adapt back to the culture over there (even though I really love Tunisia and I'm planning to go back) so I really applaud your audacity for taking such an adventure.

1.As mentioned before, trust no one (people are sick with wanting to flee the country so they'll do anything to get a visa through you)
2. Don't go out at night especially in places you don't know. Safety is a concern.
3. Always hide your valuables like phone and wallet.
4. Forget about something called personal space. That doesn't exist in Tunisia.
5. Be ready to fight for your rights wherever you go.

Despite all of those things I still believe Tunisia is a beautiful country and offers a great experience for anyone who travels there. It's just that it's a 3rd world country and it has been through dire financial issues which makes everyone living under stress in the country.

Concerning the location, I lived my whole life in Sousse/Kantaoui area. I definitely prefer it over Tunis the Capital since it's less crowded and more manageable for someone who's new, and yet it's very beautiful area with multiple attractions.

As far as renting goes, you could look for posts on websites like Tayara.tn and then you could contact people via Whatsapp on their phone numbers.

else chance = 0%","Since I work (not full-time) in a very similar field (data visualization) and I do game dev in my free time (mainly WebGL; stuff that runs on your web browser) I can share some thoughts.

Game development is a huge field and I don't know what you want exactly: Programming (then which? Gameplay, sound, graphics, etc...), design and art (also what? 3D modelling, sounds, animations, etc...). I can only give some questionable advice about the programming side.

Let's assume you want to be a game dev programmer, then basic CS modules with a particular focus on graphics is needed. I studied at ENSI and I still find online books absolutely top notch at teaching me anything in CS.

A good thing about game dev, if you manage to become a good game dev programmer then tons of other opportunities open up for you. Why I say this? Well game dev opportunities are relatively scarce (if compared to Web dev for instance) and you may very well find it extremely difficult to enter the field. Therefore keeping other options open is the best.

People mention individual Steam success as of they are the norm. No. Publishing a successful game is extremely difficult. A good advice is to not rely on that and work with big studios instead.

Concerning the degree, I don't think it matters that much. Yes a degree in CS is important but at the end they will judge you based on your projects and experience.

Feel free to dm me if you need more, very questionable, advices about game dev :)","I have been in the game industry for over 6 years now , I had to learn computer graphics from scratch ( opengl , directx11 ) , eventually I moved to unreal engine to become Lead technical artist at a big UK game studio.

So my question is that kissing through lips haram before and after marriage?",r/copypasta has been real quiet since this dropped,Depends if the guy’s wearing lipstick,We even do French kissing in here (kissing with lips +tongue 😝)   when i see people kissing and loving each other i feel hopeful for the future  but on the other side of the matter cursing in public and littering is way worst than kissing you should be shocked when you see a someone spitting in the ground or throwing a water bottle in the street.,"Tunisian modern couples kiss. 
Before or after marriage we don't give a damn anymore cause love is love.
A lot of tunisian people aren't that religious, most of us drink and fu** mostly men but a lot of girls do too.
You'll also find real muslim people, atheist, Christian, Jewish... And no one gives a damn about what the others do

- Paypal is going to cause way more problems than solve any",[deleted],"Regarding iPhone and Androids, i own and use both and this is my observation. 
For regular use an iPhone performs better, animations are smooth, app switching is fast, the ui is responsive, battery life is great, the software is optimized to run on the hardware even though on paper they look underpowered. 
Androids is a generic os and highly customizable and is open for customization (to a certain extent) it’s great for tinkering compared to ios which is completely locked down. The os is meant to run on a plethora of hardware combinations, this can cause all kind of issues especially on underpowered systems, it’s the manufacturers responsibility to make sure the system works well. Let’s stick to the big names like Samsung… from my experience i find that the system degrade with time, something that an iPhone won’t experience as much, Android will inevitably become slow and laggy, also manufacturers are now developing their own « skin », some are better than other, some are worse than stock Android, it’s highly fragmented, if you decide to change the Android phone brand for your grandpa he will be lost and have to re-learn some stuff, iPhones are more consistant.

If you only care about the apps (Youtube, social media crap) iPhones are just better and optimized for that.
If you value customization, go with Android (avoid the cheap garbage)

Regarding the overpriced argument, i would say it’s partially true but it’s due to inflation. I would say the same thing for someone owning a flagship Samsung, it’s not cheap. Android is open for more competition, that forces the price to go down. There’s only Apple making iPhones, they can increase the price however they want as long as people keep buying them.
And for the status of wealth argument, that’s a bi product of their cost and rarity among the Tunisian population. That’s not the case in other developed countries. It’s not that hard or prestigious to own an iPhone.

Biometric Identification Card: Mandatory from Age 15, Occupation Removed from Data

December 27, 2023, 07:45

Hala Jaballah, Chairwoman of the Committee for Rights and Freedoms, discussed the work session held last Monday regarding a draft law to amend and complete the legislation related to the national identification card.

She revealed that according to the proposed law, the current card will be replaced with a biometric one, which will be mandatory from the age of 15. It can also be obtained at the age of 12 with parental authorization when necessary.

She clarified that the information on the card will be continuously updated, and the card itself will not have a specific expiration date, unlike the old card.

Furthermore,Bord Deputy Hala Jaballah explained that the biometric card will contain an electronic chip that stores essential data such as name, surname, father's name, mother's name, date of birth, gender, along with a photograph and a thumbprint. Optional information, such as organ donation and blood type, can also be included.

She announced that the draft law stipulates the removal of the occupation from the identification card, and there is an agreement within the committee to eliminate this data to establish social justice among all citizens.

*She also emphasized that the sessions and hearings regarding the draft law for the national identification card are still ongoing, involving all parties, including authorities and ministries.*",,,,,,2023-12-27 07:47:22

To make it even better, try looking into related areas. For example, check out IT guidance for companies. You'll get to review things like software licenses and contracts, which is pretty cool and adds a tech twist to your legal skills.

Another good move is exploring the connection between law and health finance. This means you'd be dealing with legal stuff in the healthcare money world. It's interesting and gives you a different perspective on how laws work in different fields.

So, by mixing it up like this, you not only show you can adapt but also learn about law in various settings. It'll make your internship more exciting and give you a solid foundation for your future legal adventures. Keep up the good thinking!",,,,2023-12-26 16:19:47

- how safe is it for women to solo travel?
- do you recommend an air bnb as theyre cheaper? if so, in what areas are they safest?
- do you guys use any taxi apps like Uber, Bolt, Yandex, etc. 
- is english common there?
- any general recommendations or tips that i wouldnt be able to get by googling?
- any food delivery services like ubereats, boltfood, etc?

thank you! 🤍","- It's relatively safe, depending on the neighborhood, just avoid walking alone at night in empty neighborhoods or downtown.
- I think the safest places to rent an Airbnb would be La Marsa, Sidi Bousaid, Carthage.. (If you're staying in Tunis)
- We use Bolt and a couple of other apps, but only in the capital areas. Normal taxis are cheaper though. 
- Not as common, if you need to ask for directions or something, try asking someone who looks young (like in their twenties/teenagers).
- Be aware of scammers, if you get asked to hold something ( that could go from flowers to an actual animal), or to take a picture,  refuse to. They would charge you for money for it. Avoid using your phone in the street so it won't get stolen and hold your bag close to you.

- many people are looking for employment, ideally government employment, not for work. Otherwise the country would not need to - quite absurdly - import workers while suffering from unemployment 


- a partial root cause of that was the inflation of diplomas as ZABA built a system to keep people busy at school/university and off the streets.

## La Tunisie est l’un des principaux points de transit pour les migrants clandestins locaux et originaires d’Afrique subsaharienne vers l’Europe. Entre janvier et septembre 2023, plus de 14 000 migrants tunisiens ont atteint les côtes européennes clandestinement, selon les données nationales.

La Tunisie et l’Italie ont signé, le 20 octobre dernier, un accord permettant la création de nouvelles voies de migration régulière entre les deux pays, à l’issue d’une rencontre de travail entre le ministre tunisien des Affaires étrangères, Nabil Ammar (photo, à droite), et son homologue italien Antonio Tajani (photo, à gauche), à Tunis.

Selon le communiqué du ministère tunisien, cet accord vise à offrir chaque année, à 4 000 travailleurs tunisiens qualifiés, l’opportunité d’aller travailler en Italie sur une période de trois ans.

Cette initiative s’inscrit dans le cadre d’une approche globale des deux pays à « promouvoir la migration légale, à lutter contre la migration irrégulière et la traite des êtres humains tout en permettant aux jeunes Tunisiens d’accéder aux opportunités d’emploi en Italie », indique la note d’information.

Il y a quelques semaines, ce pays d’Afrique du Nord, l’un des principaux points de transit pour des migrants clandestins locaux et originaires d’Afrique subsaharienne vers l’Europe, avait refusé l’aide financière de l’Union européenne dans le cadre d’un accord migratoire. 

Selon l’exécutif tunisien, cette aide allait à l’encontre de l’accord signé et de « l’esprit » qui a régné lors de la conférence de Rome sur la gestion des flux migratoires, tenue en juillet dernier. En effet, Tunis et Bruxelles avaient conclu un accord de près de 105 millions de dollars d’aide visant à lutter contre l’immigration irrégulière avec près de 42 millions dollars qui allaient être « alloués rapidement ».

Pour rappel, la Tunisie fait actuellement face à une situation socio-économique complexe marquée par des négociations avec le FMI, la flambée des prix et les désaccords avec l’Union générale tunisienne du travail (UGTT). Au premier trimestre 2023, le taux de chômage s’élevait à 16,1 % contre 15,2 % au dernier trimestre 2022, selon l’Institut national de la statistique.

Selon les données du Forum tunisien pour les droits économiques et sociaux (FTDES), depuis le début de l’année 2023, plus de 14 000 migrants tunisiens ont atteint les côtes européennes clandestinement.","Let’s goooooo. This is bad for both sides.

Aaslema ennes lkol, 

Inchallah lkolkom labes ! It is my first post on this sub. 

So title is self explanatory but I’ll give you more context. 

I am 25 years old (soon 26), I have been living for 7 years in Paris and let’s say that career wise I have been very lucky, since graduating. 

I am in the process of joining a US crypto unicorn as head of Business Development. The position is fully remote. My total compensation package is $215K annually. So around $18K/month. I have also done well in the crypto markets and have around $400K saved in the forms of various tokens. So I am relatively upper class even in western countries standards. 

I haven’t been to Tunisia for the past 5 years now, due to mainly work and never finding the right time. I take care of my family financially so always feel pressure.

But for the past year, I have been feeling less and less good here in France. Radical changes in society in terms of more racism, more insecurity, higher cost of living, taxes… I feel like despite everything I’ll always be just « an Arab » and a foreigner. 

And in the other hand I want to spend more times with my parents (They are turning 60 this year) and family and be in a place where I am welcomed and can for exemple go to the Mosque without people viewing it as weird. 

I have many questions : How does taxation work? Should I create an offshore company in Tunisia? How does FCR actually work?

How much would I need to live a « lavish » lifestyle in Tunis : Eat often at fancy restaurants, go out a lot, travel…?

And finally if you were in my shoes what would you do ? A lot people say I’m crazy to wanting to go back while others like my parents (Biased?) think it’s better and can live like a « king » here. 

Thanks 🇹🇳","u are such an inspiration man, to achieve what u achieved at 25 years old is unusual und magnificent. And u seem to be more mature and u know what u want in life, i have no informations relating to what u are asking but i wish u all the best.","I've thought about moving back from Germany myself, but whenever I see Tunisians at the airport, hear them talk, then see the animals working at the Tunis International Airport, I drop that plan entirely. 

There is no price tag on safe streets, available medicine, non-criminal cops, water, electricity and no commies having a say in the local economy.","First of all congrats bud, what you are doing is freaking impressive and you are doing incredible.

I have lived studied and worked abroad and I am fully back to tounis and I don’t regret my decision one bit. I don’t have the kind of cushy gig like you but I am making enough money to live very well and mayonkosni chay but I am paid in dinars and not dollars. Basically, 300$ are more than enough to eat often at restaurants, travel across the country by car. (I’m not factoring alcohol because I don’t drink)

For the taxation questions, you need an accountant and to make a batinda here. You will be able to bring in your dollars legally, use them as dollars and convert them legally as well.

For FCR, you need to make a copy of your entire passport and CIN. Head to your nearest kbaadha and ask for مطلب اعلام برجوع نهائي. You fill it out and that’s all.

One last thing, I’m a minimalist, I don’t consume a lot (other than videogames). The offer in tounis is very limited and good quality items is sold at a markup. If you’re a shopping aficionado, be warned.

P.S: I’m a quantitative researcher at a hedge fund here, If you ever think of opening a startup here hit me up.","I'd suggest you give it a try 1st... come and stay for a month or 2 and see how you feel about that 1st, then decide whether you wanna come back for good or not. I have siblings who live abroad they're always looking forward to come visit but 1 week in maximum and they're already fed up and want to get back. Quality of life and services hits different here. There are things that you can't control even with your high income.","Even the whiniest Tunisians will tell you that it's a great country if you're in the top 10%, with that salary you will rank higher than that. The situations is deteriorating every time I go there unfortunately and more and more people are leaving. For example tap water is unstable in the summer, the supply of certain goods is unstable. Crime is bit on the rise with the robbings. What you can do is buy a house in a very good neighborhood in a nicer city (Marsa, Monastir come to mind) and get away from most of the problems. I feel the same way in Germany btw, it's not racist, just very dull. Also trying to make it with crypto. Not going back anytime soon though.

>Eat often at fancy restaurants, go out a lot, travel…?

It's not much cheaper. Meat and fish costs about the same as here (about $13 a kilo). One nice thing here is that the quality is so superior to europe's if you're into that (I am!). Nice restaurants cost $10-20 a meal. So as for food and going out, you can have everything at $1000 a month even if you're wasteful. A nice house will cost you $500k.

>And finally if you were in my shoes what would you do ?

I would look for another arab country to move to, you're muslim so that helps. Buy a house in Tunisia, go there 3 months a year to enjoy and realize why I moved away in the first place, it's what the rich Tunisians I know do except they're based in Europe.",2023-12-23 14:09:34

I've registered 5 phones total using my passport, my wife's and my kid's on the website, free of charge.

It would also be lit to have a community where we can share knowledge experiences and discuss interesting papers and ideas that might shape the future of the industry.

6- Sell 50% of interior regions and the North-West to Algeria (Tbarka stays tho, too lovely than Algeria deserves)

7- Sell the South to Libya

8- Give Nestlé complete control over our agriculture

9- Government workers can legally own their job and pass it on to their children.

10- Every Tunisian should pimp out at least 3 women from his family to Libyans and Algerians

11- Ban private investment for anyone who isn't سي فلان (See number 5). That also goes for small shops and cafés 

The plans for education, culture and politics: 

1- Remove STEM subjects and emphasize more on dancing, theater and sexual education.

2- Grant UGTT and UGET complete control over all universities (even the private ones). Yelling and beating your professors is how everyone should get their degree. Learning and exams are classist and part of an international capitalist conspiracy.

3- Inmates with life sentences and on death row are to be rehabilitated in Tunisian public schools along with our children

4- Unions are allowed to own guns and heavy weaponry. Physical education teachers can now diddle your kids at gunpoint. So no more need for strikes (legal or illegal) تضامنا مع الزميل when he gets caught

5- Foreign currency should only be used for concerts 

6- Abolish the Ministry of Culture and turn it straight into an ATM for actors and other ""artists"". No need to pretend that they're producing anything anymore (fewer ministries = less salaries to pay)

7- Forgive Israel for Operation Wooden Leg. We shouldn't be as whiny as the US with 9/11 and Pearl Harbor

8- Replace ""Allah"" in all official documents with ""Bourguiba"" 

9- Expose Farhat Hached as the traitor he is for trying to ruin the good thing we're having with France.

10- Remove article 1 of the constitution for more transparency. We're not a real country, we're not independent and we definitely aren't arab or muslim.

11- Pictures of Ben Ali are mandatory again

18nwzim,https://i.redd.it/gl3y8mysbp7c1.jpeg,72,One of The Best Things We Did Was When We Legalized Abortion in 1973 and the Debate Ended There.,,Actually the gestational limit in Tunisia is 13 weeks and 6 days.,"Tbh let the people live the way they want.
I'm muslim by choice hamdoullah and I still agree with this law. Why? Because not everyone in Tunis is muslim!
People need to get that into their thick skull.
The Prophet (p.b.u.h.) said himself that nobody should be forced into Islam but join by his own volition.

I know that nowadays most say they're muslim but they give a rat's ass about adhering to the Quran, its revelations and the Prophets (p.b.u.h.) teachings.
They bend it like it fits them and go on.

Tbh I don't care at all if I know someone who's not muslim or a pretend-to-be-muslim to chase after him and tell him what's wrong and what's right. It's their damn business. I only give advice when I'm specifically asked.

The way the law on abortion is right now fits Tunis as we would have a lot of fatherless children indeed and as you know a majority of those tend to grow messed up unfortunately because they were raised in an unhealthy environment.

If a guy is willingly chasing after women or a women is chasing after guys then he/she exactly knows what they're doing and also know that it is unislamic and they will definitely not care about it as they either have no Iman or simply aren't muslim.

Nobody has a right to berate them as it is futile to do so. That's the current shape of the world we're living in right now.

If they choose promiscuity it's their life.
If you're concerned about your own children then see to it to raise them the way you think is right.
If you want them to be proper muslims then teach them about it in a friendly non-manipulative way and pray to Allah that he will guide them down a righteous path.
If you don't care about it then try raising them so that they'll be a functional happy human that has a good moral compass and won't be a menace to society.","Extremely impressive. No country needs thousands of fatherless children running around. Many become either criminals, or religious fanatics.",In the UK you have the right to an abortion up to 24 weeks and then after that in certain circumstances such as risk to mother etc.,"Thank God, we would have a lot of fatherless children asking why their Libyan daddy doesn't visit them in Tunis or the Sahel",2023-12-21 20:51:42

hi everyone naqra bac math sna w lezemni njib moyen minimum 16 bch nmchi lel haja eli nhebha . Thus, i've been struggling with my mental health since i was 16years old let's say . i went to psychiatrist today and she didn't help at all because she didn't understand my issue ( maybe i didn't know how to express my feelings because it's the first time opening up to a person) i have another session next month and i hope i can try to explain to her more abt my issues and life .

Anyway , i'm here today seeking help because i need to study cuz time is running out and i'm completely lost . I have had good marks since 1ere annee (moyen mte3i mayti7ch m17) until 3eme annee, my marks started going down (jebt 15 moyen ) w fil bac 1ere trimester netsawerch nakhlet hete l13 moyen noteti tay7in 3lkher. But since 2eme annee , i feel really empty inside i have no purpose in life i'm living but i'm not living ( i'm physically present but mentally absent ) i have a goal and i want to achieve it but this goal progressively started to faint as i get older and start to realize that it's hard to reach it (i want to be a software engineer) . Adding to that , I have never been happy with my self or what i did , i always blame myself for everything , i'm too hard on myself but i can't help it . Moreover, when i look at myself i can't find something that makes me unique or interesting basically i'm stupid , ugly and disgusting maybe the only good thing is my personality since i have great mindset and kindhearted as my friends say ( i don't claim that). Also, i'm that therapist friend that everyone feels safe talking to and expressing their feelings which made me feel exhausted and numb because it's hard for me to not only handle my problems but also listen to my friend's problems and try to help them . Sadly, i have never tried to reach out to someone because when i compare my problems with others i feel like it's not worth to be sad about so i accept the fact that now one will listen to me and ignore that problem and live with it holding that sad feelings inside me and try to move on but i never did ( it's clearely not a good solution to get over my problems ) . Besides, when i'm studying i don't feel like i accomplish something even if i solve a quiete hard exercise i feel like i did nothing special and everyone will get it easily .

So please if u have an idea or a solution on how can i ignore my feelings again and start stduying like i was in 1ere annee ( bgalb w rab kime ngolo) tell me

Bon courage","U are in a bad situation, it's not a subject could be handled in texting but really hope you get through it. Think i have something would help you resist your negative feelings but it's way too late. as i said u have to resist your feelings. I suggest first to expand your circle of philosophical knowledge. Some philosophical orientations would give you the push and the urge to complete and i prefer to take a look of the nihilism/absurdism/stoicism. And also some psychological knowledge would help you to understand yourself way better an open your eyes much wider. All of that is just a resistance(short term solution) its consequences would be so bad in a long term but it's the only way i could see(i have bac too this year, wouldn't compare who's mental health worst but that helps me specially which i have those knowledge before)","Try to open up to the therapist more , may be try to write how you feel and what are your concerns so you will be able to communicate more your inner thoughts and issues .

About the self love thing I once was in your place  but I was younger , I was in middle school then , I didn't totally hate myself but I had some kind of hopelessness and the positive thing then was that I was a in the top my class , that made me feel assured and made my sorrow less .But I overcome it,  wasn't easy , it was a lot of hard work , of self reflection and self improvement, I read books and watched tv shows that talked about personal development. Seeing a therapist at that time would've been a privilege. So my friend, don't wait for the motivation to come , sit on the chair now and try to enjoy studying that helped in Bac. Try to think not about the Bac, shift your mindset , think of what happened as an opportunity to start the race with a more powerful mindset. Still plenty of time to study and you can achieve that . And considering you had good grades in the previous years that means you have potential and the ground for sucess, you have to enjoy the process of learning so that might decrease the pressure of achieving and performing . Make a plan and try to be consistent as possible as you can and try to be your first priority , and say no to distractions. Make studying cosy and kind of routine to make it less intimidating. How about thinking like a scientist when you solve a physical dilemma or like a philosopher when you read a text , they are normal people too , see Bac as a pleasure challenge not a dead end. I know it sounds poetic , but it's good to change our perspectives and take a step back and see things from another corner.

So I've been studying in a Chinese program (via my university here) and now that it's the last year we are required to go to china and finish the last year there (4 months language, 2months  holiday and four months pfe ) 
The thing is the Chinese university said that the visa will be for one year and we're expected to go there on the 7th of march. 
Now the problem lies with the papers and the procedure 
According to my research I don't need that much papers : -admission letter 
- jw paper 
-online visa application 
- photos and a copy of the passport 
-attestation des fonds (2500$ par an) 
That's all but unfortunately the university is the one providing the jw and admission letter and they won't do so until January 
So can anyone help me in any kind and walk me throu the procedure of applying to visa ( TLS ,embassy ....) Or if am missing any papers 
What is this paper called ""attestation des fonds "" and how do I do it, how long does it take to get an answer for the visa .... 
Any help is appreciated and thank you guys","Two months (January to March) normally should be plenty of time to process it, but make sure you are filling out all parts of all forms completely correctly and don't make any spelling mistakes or accidental inconsistensies, because it may make them deny your visa and force you to start over.

Attestation des fonds is a proof that you have this amount of money in your personal capacity. Its purpose is to ensure that you'll be able to finance yourself while you're there. If the program is funding things like school fees, food and housing, you probably only need proof of that. If you're self-funding it all, probably the way to get this document is have your bank (or your parents' bank, depending on your situation) create it.

Sounds like an amazing opportunity and good luck.",May i ask what university do you study in and what field,,,,2023-12-21 13:03:30

Hey Reddit friends,

I've always wanted to try fishing, but I never had the time or money for it. Luckily, now that I'm working as a freelancer, I've got both! But here's the thing: I'm totally new to fishing. I haven't bought any gear yet, and I really need some advice.

I live in Ariana, Tunisia, so I can easily go to any beach nearby. But I don't know what kinds of fish we have here. Can anyone tell me about the local fish?

Also, do I need a license to fish here, or is it okay without one? And I could really use some tips on what equipment and bait to get. If you know anything about fishing, please share your knowledge with me. I'm super excited to start fishing and would appreciate any help you can give.

arresting these people, was quite daring and really accepted by most people since they are known to have meddeled too much into politics for their own personal gain, some of them didn't yet had a ""faux pas"" with the others and got pulled into this too.After 6 months of arrest the narrative changes, again naturally, to the need to accelerate a prosecution as the public needs to know who did them bad and who didn't.

after 9 months the need for that knowledge is no longer necessary and the public stopped caring, and now these people are used by the regime as scape goats, to pull other people into the prosecution and extend and embellish in the antoginisation of ""el mouta2emirin"" ala ""goldestein"".

with this extension of the arrest period, we are eveolving this case even more to, in my view, an even more abuse of power and hardships put on people whoes crimes are way eclipsed the general guilt the regime has stuck to them. and by consequence, creating a an ennemy, although has a legitimate source, is 99% fictional and is used to frighten people. A very simlar situation to ""rawabit himeyit el thawra"", this time it's in our heads.

at night it's simple not advisable even for men because there are drunkards and high people at large (generally after 22h), and they tend to be troublesome to everyone around them, not just women. although it's more dangerous for a woman. there isn't much reason to go out at night anyway. it's too cold and there is nothing out there since everyone just prefers to be at home burried in their blankets.

Not a hasbara bot, just driven here by the algorithm. Normally, I would not interact with your sub, but the nature of your post leads me to think maybe you could hear me out.

I'm not Tunisian, but my grandmother came to Palestine from Morroco. Morroco is well known for being relatively safe for Jews. Many Jews and even Israeli Jews of Moroccan background travel to Morroco to maintain cultural ties. 

But safe is not the same thing as well treated. My Savta refuses to talk about it, but my mom told me that her family was treated....not well. lots of discrimination against them for being Jewish, and refusal to employ her father. So were they expelled from Morroco? No. No they were not expelled.

Did my mother's mother feel welcome to stay in Morocco as a Jew? *Absolutely not.* And that's why they booked it to Palestine in 1947. Much of my family is Israeli as a direct result of this.

I want to share this story so you understand that some Jews from Arab lands felt pressure to emigrate even if there wasn't legal expulsion. (That being said, there were countries that were very violent towards their Jews, like in Iraq. However, none of my family is from Iraq, so I will leave that to an Iraqi Jew to explain).

There's a lot of daylight between expulsion and ethnic cleansing and equal treatment. I think you have lots of Jews who felt discrimination and pressure and even violence and so they left, even in countries where expulsion wasn't a government mandate.

(For the record, if it makes you feel better, I am disgusted with Bibi and consider him a criminal. I am horrified by the current mass deaths in Gaza. I don't support Hamas, but I also dont support Bibi and his right wing government and have not for a very long time. Also, I don't even live in Israel anymore, so please don't yell at me to get out of Palestine....I already left!)","My grandma's close friend was a Jew from Gabes whose son was ""saving to buy land in Palestine"" long before the pogroms.   
When Guy de Maupassant visited Tunis in the late 19th century, he called it a ""jewish city"" because he was impressed at how confident the Jews were living amongst other Tunisians in comparison to Europe.","Tunisia didn't expell jews, many non jewish people hid jews during the German occupation of tunis .
And even long before that, jews were a part of the community. Sidi me7rez for instance, vocated for the inclusion of jewish neighborhood inside the walls of the medina. And was known as the protector of jews.
If they qere expelled,  how come we still have jewish families living in lafayette, jerba, la goulette.... and refusing to join Israel even though they were promised houses and lands there","It's the Israeli narrative.. ""we told the arabs tgat we want to live together in peace but they attacked us and deported their jewish communities to us"" all been debunked by historians","In Tunisia, Jews were not kicked out no. They largely moved to France and Israel for economic (many people were boycotting them at the time) and ideological (Zionism) reasons. Riots did happen whenever conflicts happened in Palestine but the state did not endorse the violence and actively persecuted its assailants. But it can be said that those riots made Jews feel unwelcome in the country, that can't be denied, and it was certainly a factor in them moving out.",2023-12-20 15:59:15

""Then why didn't you go back there?""

""I got this excuse thing with stuff and shit""","Its not as black & white. The actua lifestyle in the west comes with many HUGE problems but they are hidden underneath the surface. I'll share my perspective frlm Canada.

1) the weather. Shovelling snow for hours, barely being able to drive without an accident, your car rusting away in one year, the COLD, for most of the year, it is so so so cold its crazy. Have you ever spent an hour in -45 degrees ? Your snot and tears freeze right on your face. Its intense and its MOST of the year. Even health complications happen more often, my mom slid on ice and broke some fingers, my uncle has developped arthritis, etc.

2) Cost of living. Granted you make WAY more money even in the shittiest job but everything costs so much more and the worst part is, this society is fuelled by debt. Instead of buying a phone, i have to finance it and pay it over 2 years. Cars are financed too,'housing, etc.
Its extremely easy to get into debt and very hard ro get out of. 

3. Community values & living. There is no sense of national identity. You are always looked at as a foreigner. You will deal with racism, ( i got death threats and i was born here) 
Lack of community life means you rarely can trust strangers, there is no activity in which you regularly get to know your community. Dating is hard and the majority of potential partners are absolute garbage, Tunisia wins hands down in this category. It also means that kids get mostly kicked out of the house when they turn 18  and parents get sent to centers for old people once they cant take care of themselves.

I have worked in these centers during covid, Tunisia might be bad but the fact that we take care of our parents until their deaths is amazing. The shit i have seen is insane. I saw elderly people die of THIRST. 
I saw them stay in their shit-filled diapers for DAYS.
I saw them have no contact with basicallly anyone, i saw them cry, struggle , etc. 

This is one of the MANY ways that the individualistic lifestyle of the west (canada) has caused a dramatic shift in community life but its not one aspect only, you WILL FEEL IT EVERYDAY, and you will miss Tunisia, because for all its flaws and assholes, it is a BEAUTIFUL country, but also, the people are mostly extremely loving & caring.

PS- i brought 4 friends from Canada last summer to come experience Tunisia, they have travelled every continent and dozens of countries. Tunisia was their favourite by far and they will be coming back next year. Don't under estimate our country, its unique.","I haven't been abroad for a long time to draw any conclusions but here's my two cents : while my life here is a decent upgrade from that in Tunisia (in terms of quality of services, infrastructure, open mindedness of people...) the individualistic society here will leave you yearning for a sense of belonging. There are things that I hate and that made me leave Tunisia but I also recognise it is my home and where I belong and find meaningful connection with people that matter to me.",w ykarzou ki t9oul tounes matnajemch t3ich feha w t7eb tokhrej,"Never met anyone like that, everyone I met spit on the country profusedly","W tal9ah hey kol sif yetzaber 3al 5ale9 b 500 euro

This doesn't only include random ordinary people but also many famous people. For example, Tawfik Gharbi and Mondher Jridi every time they are on TV the only thing you'll hear them saying is how TV directors didn't see the great actor qualities in them and that that is reason why they hadn't had many important roles in their careers. 

It is so typical of that type of people that they will try always to put the blame on someone else instead of assuming the responsibility of their own deeds. For example both have been (and very probably are still are) alcohol addicts and that has undoubtedly led to them taking bad decisions in their lives which affected their careers. I mean, if you are unwise enough to have fallen victim for alcohol addiction then the likelihood that you have taken many other bad decisions in your life is quite big. 

Moreover, it is one of the very very basics of personal development literature that the one big difference between successful people and those who are not successful is exactly this: successful people do take responsibility for what they do while others try always to find someone else or something else to blame. I mean, you're not as good actor as you think and you have not always taken the right decisions in your life. Do understand this and do admit it and then you will notice a change in your life. This of course applies to the approximately 8 to 10 millions other Tunisians who have the same mentality.",,,,,,2023-12-20 13:28:05

I'm curious to know your thoughts on the current political situation, particularly regarding immigration laws. How are you feeling about it, and what are your plans? I've heard some friends mention they're considering leaving France – is that something you're contemplating as well?","Nothing Special about the new law. ([Here](https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2023/12/19/projet-de-loi-immigration-tout-ce-qui-a-change-entre-le-projet-initial-la-version-du-senat-et-de-l-assemblee-et-celle-de-la-cmp_6205115_4355771.html#huit-anchor-durcissement-des-conditions-d) is the digest of it)

Basically it is making life harder for illegals in some aspects (but also added some positive things), and for those who commit crimes.

Some social aids were made harder to get, but, those who are here with stable situations, don't need them.

Some conditions added for those who want to bring their families (regroupement familial)

Overall, life in France is not bad, if you watch the news channels like BFM and Cnews (which are the worst and the most buzz/sensational driven channels, plus a lot of their guests are openly racist), or if you follow news on Facebook and such, you may think it is hell on earth for migrants, but it is not. The reality is way different. As an example, when the Israeli army started its massive attacks on Gaza, the interior minister, Darmanin, decreed that all protests and marches in support of Palestine will be automatically banned, the constitutional court overruled that decree because it is illegal. This is a peek on how things work here, and the rule of law is actually a thing here. So as an immigrant, I know that the law will protect me when I need it, and if I am a victim of some racist action, I know that the law will protect my rights. Yep, racist crimes are no joke here, and they don't go unpunished. Eric Zemmour (an others) where condemned for racist declarations, more than once, no one is above the law.

French people are actually nice toward immigrants, some of them (leftist mainly) defend the immigrants, even the illegals, and find that the state is way too harsh on them. It is true that lately the french politicians are becoming more and more extremists, but its a wave hitting all the world, not just France, and we've seen that in Tunisia too.

French people don't really care about this new law, it does not concern them at all, other than a bunch of ignorant racists. Their main concerns is inflation, education, health care, retirement, the environment, public services, cost of life... you know every problems that every one in the world worry about. Statistics show that there is no relevant increase of violence due to immigration, but the French media and the french right wing politicians are exaggerating every thing, and even lying about it, and you know there is a saying ""a lie is said in 15 seconds, explaining that it is a lie takes 15 minutes"".

Do I think that I will leave France someday soon? It is highly unlikely, and even if I left, I will not be going back to Tunisia, I will go to the UK or Germany. Tunisia is unlivable right now, and I don't think that things are going to be any better, any time soon. I am actually having a good life here, I have a great job with a good salary, my kid goes to school, I live in a nice city, I have never been a victim of any kind of agression, some people are just impolite, but that's how things are in big cities, but most people are respectful, much more than Tunisians toward each other. I am never afraid or stressed about being the victim of any discrimination. So far, only once, some woman talked down to me, about some administrative protocol, I just showed her the text proving I was right and she was wrong, she just shut her clap. but other than that, I have a normal life, almost as if I was in my native country.

Those who think that they are going home at some point, because France is racist are overreacting in my opinion, they didn't think it through. Especially if they have kids. There are some basic quality services you find here that you can't find in Tunisia, Free health care, free good quality public education, public transport... and a lot of other things you don't find in Tunisia.

You may think, but if you don't come back, who is gonna make the country better: well sorry, I tried, I lost my job trying to make a little change, and how was that rewarded? People voted for Ennahdha and Kalb Tounes, and voted For KS and NK for presidency, and when KS overthrew the democratic process (even if it was going bad) and all the illegal arrests and persecution of the opposition, they cheered. Sorry man, but I can't make any more sacrifices for this people, I have other responsibilities now, it is not my fight anymore

That was my opinion and rant, feel free to ask me anything you want","I hope they reduce immigration to 0 and deny citizenship to everyone from Africa.

It will hurt France more than it will hurt Africa since they have an aging population. We've already seen the response to the increase in retirement age.

Tunisians and other educated Africans will no longer migrate to France (Europe as a whole) which will help mitigate the brain drain. My hope is that the government take advantage of this situation to utilize the returning diaspora.

France has never treated Tunisians (or any other African) as equals despite everything they do for the country. I hope this is just another step towards the end of Françafrique.","We are tired of the mafia and criminals that dirty our name here, I hope France actually does something about them and opens up immigration only for people actually motivated by the country",Shiiiit,"Overall

On a personal note, I'm gearing up to tie the knot soon, so it would be fantastic to connect with couples who share similar interests. If my future wife is available to join in on the fun, that would be the cherry on top!

A bit about me:

* I'm passionate about hiking and cycling, so if you enjoy the great outdoors, we're off to a great start! 
* Whether it's the latest blockbuster or a hidden indie gem, I love movies and would be thrilled to catch a film or binge-watch a series with new friends. 
* Music is a big part of my life, and while I appreciate all genres, I'm particularly heavy on rock. Let's swap playlists and discover new tunes together!
* Sports and fitness are key elements in my routine, and I'm always up for a good workout or a friendly sports match. 
* I'm a sucker for intellectual discussions, especially those centered around science and weird facts. If you enjoy engaging in thoughtful debates, we're on the same wavelength!

18lfa7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/18lfa7p/ben_ali_regime/,4,Ben Ali regime,Cause i didn't live much under Ben Ali regime i want to hear your honest opinion about his Regim. and how life was back then .,"It was a functioning dictatorship in which 91% of it occurred before the 2008 crisis, this fact is incredibly important as after that event, the entire world got hit, everything became more expensive and life quality dropped in most developing-countries. 

&nbsp;

This is my view of the old regime in a nutshell:

* Economically: 
 * we weren't in shitty condition like now, but we weren't Malisya or South Korea either. 
 * Circumstances + Competent ministers + limited amount of people with high ambition driven by corruption (his family and few others)

 * This resulted in the mini-prosperity old people are talking about now. 

 * Sea-side cities had it **MUCH BETTER** than the internal region, this was a huge mistake Bourguiba did, but Ben Ali also continued to build on it, contrary to most believes, I personally think they didn't do that out of spite, they were just lazy incompetent leaders with primitive visions. 

&nbsp;

* Ambitions: 
 * Imo this was the key factor, I am 30y.o now, I was 17 when the revolution happened, I truly remember a time (from ~1999 to ~2007) where ""leveling up"" financially was something that people truly believed in, whether by education, or some self-made business, it was a time where going to school ""made sense"", and a lot of people believed it in it, getting your bac was like a super main event that can open real doors, etc...

 * after that, the whole mentality shifted, becoming a jobless engineer who end up working ""mramma"" became a ""meme"", the big push for ""takwin mehni"" despite its usefulness also built a general picture of ""higher education is useless"". 

 * combine that with the corruption of ""lezem 3andek m3aref"" to do anything, the global economical crisis, and the general dictatorship vibe (any cop could literally ruin your life if you were in the wrong time/wrong place) and the result was [the 2008 revolution attempt](https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A3%D8%AD%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AB_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%88%D8%B6_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%86%D8%AC%D9%85%D9%8A) (it happened there because these regions really had it much worse than the sea-side cities)


&nbsp;

* Feeling of oppression : 
 * doesn't matter who you are or what are your political believes, at one point, you were going to be forced to do a little bit of ""ass kissing"" to the system, it can be something as simple as your primary school teacher pressing you (a 9y.o kid) to buy the 26/26 calendar, or forcing you to greet the president publically during 15 octobre event (nik ommou le mchit!) 

 * knowing, for a fact, that a cop, can and will at anytime bully the shit out of you for no reason, and no matter how many hard evidence you have, justice will never serve you. (you can imagine all sort of scenarios here, from being beaten in the stadium, to a random cop having a crush on your gf/fiancé and make it his life mission to harass the shit out of you)

 * bribery is the official national sport. 


&nbsp; 

So yeah, personally I don't miss it, and as much as i hated the incompetent cunt who ruled after 2010, at least the game got balanced a little, I literally restored the ""ambition"" part back, I can do shit on my own and not be afraid of the president cousin popping out of no where to to split the goods with me, [his brother was literally a drug trafficker who got killed by the Italian Mafia for overstepping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couscous_connection) (lolz)

&nbsp;

And this is why in my opinion, [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-OFxu85_sc) was the most popular underground song during my highschool years, it lasted for years! first time i listened to it i was 6emme primaire, but me and my friends randomly played it on occasions up until bac (revolution year +1).

&nbsp;

And this is coming from a middle-class person who lived in Bizerte (city), 15 minutes away on foot from the beach, had a computer and playstation since i can remember, imagine how it was for people who were much less fortunate. 

&nbsp;

So yeah, 

I'll take bad management over bullying anytime of the day, the problem is in recent years power abuse has been coming back and the people are busy cheering for their ""party leader"" while laughing on the misery of the other ""party members"", but that's politics in the whole world.

&nbsp;

And this is why this is the best summary for democracy: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFgcqB8-AxE","Ironically, when he first got to power, he promised political freedoms and actually released a lot of Nahdhawists out of prison, a couple of years later he pulled out the biggest reverse card and single handedly wiped them out of Tunisia, he turned out to be even worse than Bourguiba when it comes to freedoms, as for the economy he wasn't that bad but in the 2000's the situation was getting worse and worse.","It really wasn't great, as much as people try to paint it.

Salaries were as low as possible to maximize the money Ben Ali's clique could put in their pockets, but not so low that it would trigger a popular revolt. You got enough to get by and you should be thankful for it (and you won't be able to change shit if you weren't thankful for it).

The balance was disrupted following the 2008 crisis when that bare minimum now became worthless and people actually started demanding change. The 2008 Tunisian protests were arguably the prelude to the revolution and were brutally put down to prevent them from spreading out of the mining basin of Gafsa (it did spread but not significantly enough).

To get anything done you needed relatives and friends in power (el aktaf), and be ready to pay a ton of bribes along the way. People keep shitting on today's bureaucracy when before the revolution it was just as incompetent and much more corrupt.

Angering someone in power was a coin flip between rotting for a decade in a prison and a death sentence. The police could abuse and torture without impunity. If an officer stops you in the street you should start praying he won't get you in trouble in the hope of extracting a bribe of you or otherwise ruin your life.

The regime also neglected all sectors other than tourism. The agricultural and industrial sectors that were developed under Bourguiba were basically destroyed to fund the hotel owners who were close to the regime. Half of the country were neglected as a result (though that didn't start with Ben Ali for sure).

And I suppose it goes without saying, but political rights and freedom of speech were non-existent. My father was part of the university police at the time and you will be shocked by how common informants also were.","If you see anyone giving a positive opinion about that period, it is for one of the two reasons:  
1- they did not suffer any harm from Ben Ali's regime, meaning that they just went with it, and tried to get benefit from it  
2- They were actually making some kind of profit out of it, either socially, or financially: A lot of the ""aristocrats"", ""new rich"" and ""bourgeoisie"" were protected from any ""harm"" from the rest of the population, also known as ""zwewla"" (not just the poor, but everyone who is not rich).

In the following part I will use the terms ""rich"" and ""poor"" to name the two groups mentioned previously.

Examples of that, those who don't belong in some rich neighborhood, are chased away by the police, so if some young man from Ettahrir or Sidi Hassine (taking the example of Tunis, but it is also true for people coming from Jendouba/Kef or any of the southern poorer regions, to Tunis) is having some errand, or just hanging out in Marsa and Sidi Boussaid, and the police stops him for identification (and see immediately that his address does not match the area) he will be treated like shit and ordered to leave and go back to where he belongs. Especially this behavior kept happening after 2011. The message is, the ""poor"" do not belong around the rich, and they are a threat to them, the regime protects the rich from the poor, the only poor allowed around the rich are the ones who work for them. This message is well understood among the two groups: the ""rich"" understood that the regime is with them, and they will use that advantage to abuse the ""poor"", and the ""poor"" lived in that state of fear and submission to the ""rich"", and to avoid causing any problems, even if they are the victims of the abuse, because the ""rich"" can get them arrested and beaten.

You may think that this is just a pile of crap, told by someone who just hated the old regime, but I actually lived among the ""rich"", and saw how they acted all the time. I always avoid saying where I live, just to avoid that look and that judgement from people who don't know me.

My family moved from a middle class neighborhood to a ""rich"" one when I was still in elementary school, so I was around middle class people, at home and at school before we moved, and I stayed at the same school for a couple of years even after we moved. BUT, It was a shock for me, when I started going to middle school (college) in the new ""rich"" neighborhood,  to see how ""rich"" people behaved. Our middle school had some students from a neighboring poor area (really poor) and I saw how the rich kids where making fun of the poor ones because they were poor. For me it was the first time I saw that. In my previous school, we had some poor kids, kids knew which kids were the poor, and that was it. No one ever made fun of them because of their situation. We played together, sat together, ate together, I mean it was the natural way to act. But in ""rich"" middle school, rich and poor don't mix, they don't sit with them, they don't speak to them, they don't play with them, and don't share food with them. My first weeks there, I didn't know any kids, so I sat randomly in any empty spot I found, so eventually, I sat with some girl, who turns out to be one of the poor, the whole class (especially boys) looked at me and laughed at me, because I was sitting with the poor girl.  
This is some context to what comes next: during that first year, 3 poor students (boys) got expelled permanently from that school for having a fight with one of the rich kids, the rich kids were the ones who started the fights, and were making fun of the poor ones for weeks. The expelled kids were no angels neither, but for the same offenses, rich kids never got expelled. I saw this happening again and again every year during middle school and high school, ""Rich"" kids comforted by their social status, bullying the poor. Some of them personally knew some police officers, and they would call them directly when they wanted to scare the shit out of some poor guy who offended them by breathing the wrong way.  
And this a pattern was spread all around the country (and still is) and that has always existed since the Bey's era, and Ben Ali reinforced it and used it to shut down any possibility of rebellion and any thought of opposing the regime. Someone with a high a status will automatically flaunt it in the face of any one who dares to offend him, and when under threat, will run directly to the police, who will automatically track the ""offenders"" and turn their lives into a living hell.

This, in a nutshell, is what the Ben Ali's regime looked like, pitting the two groups against each other, and of course giving the advantage to the rich. All that, and the corruption induced by this system, the theft of public resources, the degradation of health and education systems... some talk about prosperity during Ben Ali's era, we all discovered it was all bullshit on the break of the 2010-2011 protests.

It is true that the governments and parliaments that came after 2011 did not make things right, and did not save the economy, but what can you do when the system is deeply corrupt, and the corrupting forces are way stronger than those who want to fight them. Never forget what happened to Fakhfakh government, the first government ever that was really going to act on its promises of fighting the corruption and saving the country.

Those who are gonna hate on this, I don't care about your opinions, just bring facts if you think what I am saying is wrong","POV of a someone born in 1990.
Ben Ali was a dictator. No doubt. Terrorizing anyone thinking about opposing his political orientation.
We were literally afraid of saying his name out loud in public.
His wife's family aka ltrabilsia were like a parallel customs taking advantage of their power to get richer.

Otherwise, for the average ayech Tunisian, not interested in Politics, nor having a profitable big business, for him, the situation was times better than now.
U can get a 'decent' public healthcare, your kids can get a good free public education, vegetables prices were ranging between 0.3 to 0.7 dt as an average. Chicken around 2 or 3 dt, Meat probably some 10dt..
Euros to DT maybe 1.2 or so...

18l43pv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/18l43pv/kais_said_conspiracy_theory/,4,Kais Said Conspiracy Theory,"let me tell you about President Kais Said. Some people, they're saying he's just another player in the corrupt game, you know? Blaming him for everything – food shortages, water issues, you name it. It's a disaster!  
and some will say that powerful lobbies are apparently playing games, thinking he's gonna stir the pot too much. They're trying to sabotage him left and right, like it's a reality show.  
what do you think?

 I'm not deep into politics, but that's the chatter I've picked up. If you've got the real scoop or a solid read on this, i would love to hear it. ","He is just another player in the corrupt game, but many players are playing in that game at the same time, not just KS. But at the end of the day, Tunisia is in a conundrum that stems primarily from debt to financial institutions.

What you'll see is that these huge international lending institutions have worked with Tunisian governments - especially around and after 2014 - who were super enthusiastic and blinded by these foreign economists in fancy suits coming in with their policies in exchange for loans that would help the economy short-term and give the local politicians here a chance at reelection. These policies follow classical neoliberal macro-economics with no regard for local circumstances: in particular, deregulation, opening the market to foreign investors and businesses, tax system restructuring (especially replacing income and corporate taxes with VAT/consumption taxation), and cutting public sector expenditures, including on subsidies and public expenditures like healthcare, education, sanitation, etc. (sometimes with the ultimate goal of privatization).

So everytime the IMF comes back to Tunisia with a new debt arrangement, it will include a further erosion of the public sector, which had historically in Tunisia failed to actually improve the economy but rather has shrunk its ability to invest while accumulating more debt. In fact, at the moment, Tunisia is spending roughly the same amount in its yearly budget on debt servicing as it is taking on new debt.

Of course, these loans are in foreign currency which allows import of essential foodstuffs, which are necessary in Tunisia because the agricultural sector was restructured with the same technical advice from international lending institutions to a point where the staples are no longer produced domestically. 

It's my interpretation that KS is attempting to address this in a 'soft way' by limiting imports, which has a short-term negative impact on the economy and is painful for consumers, but which may help alleviate Tunisia's dependence on these lending institutions in the long-term and allow Tunisia to follow more expansive financial policies that give the opportunity for public investment in for instance sufficiency-focused agriculture. However, it's a very slow burn without certainty of success because everything around it is so fraught.

A few countries and large popular movements are recognizing that these lending practices are inherently exploitative and unfair and call for broader debt cancelation around the world. Countries like Tunisia would be able in principle to organize a broadbased refusal to acknowledge or some debt owed (think of it as a workers' union, but for countries), which would probably be the most productive way to change things around, but it would have profound negative effect on this country's business elites whose fortunes are tied up on relationships with the West that would become shaky at best if Tunisia took such stances. I don't know if KS believes ideologically in this kind of action, but even if he did, I'm sure he wouldn't dare take it.","AFAIK, The gvt has decided (supported by KS) to slow down on importations in order to balance our economy. Despite it being a huge deal for citizens (ie sugar addicts), it's working well for the economy... So we might suffer from shortages, but i really hope this will work well for the future (looks promising, at least for now)","KS is a problem he is the corrupt game

I opened the comment section out of curiosity to see if any experienced people answered and i was shocked by how many comments were telling the girl how skinny she was and how she needs to eat in the worst way possible and i couldn't help it but reply to all of them in most vulgar way cuz i was so triggered.    

And after like 5 minutes I deleted all the replies and started to ask myself on how to treat bullies, should we just be as Stoic as possible or feed them their poison so they can feel how is it like to be bullied.   

What do you think","Bullies when they are in group they think they are “tough” but if you see bullies when they are alone by themselves you will realize that they are miserable, losers and most likely cowards and you can really see their insecurities and fear because they know deep inside that they are not that “tough” as they portray themselves to be and that is when you see their true character’s behind their fake image, remember if you see people that try so hard to act tough or bad infront of others they really aren’t about that in real life when they are alone. How to treat bullies is to not engage with miserable people because that is what they are.","Unfortunately we live in society full of stupid people don't worry they have been raised like that and when they will get the maturity they will know how shit they're.

All support, stay strong 😊",Wecome to the internet. Wear a helmet. The internet has always been like that all over the world.,"By turning the app/computer off, they have no power over you unless you give it to them.","Here's how I deal with bullies: some people aren't even worth a response. If you're confident enough, you won't feel the need to engage with them, whether it's a comment on social media or in real life. However, the situation becomes tricky when the bully holds some level of influence. Any reaction, or lack thereof, will matter to others, so you have to tread carefully. If you know their weak points, exploit them or try to make them feel shame for opening their mouths in the first place.

And please, don't buy into the notion that bullies are miserable in life and insecure. that doesn't matter, All that stuff you tell yourself to find comfort at the end of the day – you've been made fun of, so **Fight back.**",2023-12-18 02:16:47

Do these statements truly reflect the reality of gender imbalances in Tunisia?

Do Tunisian women have equal rights as men? Are there disparities in access to education and job opportunities based on gender in Tunisia? 
 
Do women face more cultural prejudices, sexist stereotypes and obstacles in their lives and careers? How big is the gender pay gap in Tunisia? 

Are equal inheritance, division of assets in married couple, harsher punishments for sexual assault and domestic abuse etc deemed taboo topics in the public opinion or not?

What could be done to improve the situation? In your opinion, can Tunisia achieve full gender equality in the future?","I think we’re doing aight in that department, could be better, there’s obviously room for improvement like inheritance laws and so on. 

Generally the laws in Tunisia are so much better than our Arab counterparts, in terms of gender equality and whatnot, especially concerning divorce, domestic abuse, SA and so on. 

Socially, it depends on where you live, the capital and the coast are more open minded and more accepting of feminist ideas than other states. If you go to a random village in Tunisia you would see that we’re not as progressive as we’d like to think we are. 

Overall, given the circumstances, I say Tunisia is one of the best Arab Muslim countries in terms of gender equality.","I have heard people complain about everything on the streets, but this is not one of the issues they discuss and care about (assuming it's an issue for them as the internet make it seem to be). I've only seen people complain about this online.

A vast amount of men don't even work and rely on their wives to give them their coffee and cigarettes pocket money (which is ridiculous).

Were you obliged to draw a portrait of the current leader? Which education system you prefer?,"Draw a portrait of the leader???
This was Tunisia, not North Korea.

One can criticize a lot about the two first presidents and their entourages but they both made rather wise choices with regard to education (and healthcare). For Ben Ali, I would restrict the positive decisions on education to probably the first half of his „reign“.
At some point, his priority shifted towards keeping the youth off the streets to avoid them turning against him with the result that he only delayed the problem and created his own fall in 2010. The system was diluted, marks became inflationary, everyone got a diploma and then all those young adults with a diploma in their pocket that wasn’t worth much in the real-world economy protested, in the aftermath of the 2008-9 financial crisis.

To come back to your question: the education system has gotten worse in the second half of Ben Ali‘s time and even worse since the revolution.","Alright, where to begin, I am partially deaf and I studied in school under Ben Ali Regime, college and high school.
Let me tell you that there were specials teacher for deaf, in normal schools across the country, I mean they didn't separate us from hearing children, but more like they added second teacher that speaks language sign, to translate the principal teacher and helps us to integrate in the hearing children world, there were 2 of us in class of like 30 hearing children, it is those associations that pay those specials teachers, and associations are being financed by BEN ALI and of course supervised. 
Now, I see all deaf children are being stuck with hearing children with no help, but from us. (deafs that profited from Ben Ali's Era) 

Back then, it was nothing, it was our right, but now, looking back, and I got to say that: it meant the world for me, even my mother told me that if it wasn't Ben Ali, you wouldn't where you are today, you wouldn't even be able to speak.","i only studied under Ben Ali regime.

- from time to time, the administrator will come to your class, & ask every girl that wear hijab to quit the class. education is not for ""metdaynet""
( typically, they do it in exams & the week before exams. ) 

- they will foce you to give them money for  26-26 & other similar shittt, otherwhise you will forbidden from enter your school.

- in the university, there is ""university's police"".  they have nothing to do with the police work, they only make reports about students, & as a student you can find yourself failed in your class & get low marks, just because some ""random police"" write a bad report about you.

2.If you don't have a good place to date, you prefer to date at home.
Is there any chance this could cause trouble with the neighborhood or the police

3.How long do you usually date until you get married? She is in her early 20s. I agree. Love without marriage is void.","Don't worry about number 1.

Number 2 depends heavily on the neighborhood and how much the cops want a bribe. You might also get in trouble with your landlord. Just keep the moaning to a minimum and avoid conservative neighborhoods.

Number 3 depends on how rich you are (unnecessary expensive weddings are a national sport in Tunisia)  and what her life goals are. Could be anywhere from 6 months to a couple of years.","Tunisian law is against sexual relations in 4 cases : 

1 - one of you is under 18 yo

2 - one or both of you is/are married

3 - one of you getting paid for making sex.

4 - you get caught making sex in a house that isn't rented/owned by one of you.

In tunisia, there's no rule for how long we stay together to marry, the girl age is somehow the most important criteria here. Averagely, you start getting pressure to marry when the girl is at 25/26.","0 : welcome, you’re half Tunisian now
1 : as long you both have your identities, no one will bother you 
2 :  it depends on your neighbours or the hood, usually as long there’s no loud voices or stuff like that nothing will happen ( ps : people could be just jealous , it’s not about culture it’s just their personality)
3 : there’s no limit time or deadlines, when you both really get along and understand each other’s and determine your life goals together, that’s the moment

These ""Indians"" most likely refer to Ethiopian or Nubian Christians which wouldn't be surprising as they're also recorded in Armenia in this period. They are said to have had their own name for ""Ifriqia"", “Besecath” or “Besecath”. To have their own independent terminology derived most likely from an independent name for parts of Roman Africa (**Byzacena** or **Byzacium**) like how ""Ifriqia"" itself is derived from ""Africa"" implies an antiquity of familiarity.

Now, in Ethiopian text of this same era, they referred to all Coptic Christians as ""ግብጸዌ"", or ""Gibitsewi"" derived from a coptic transliteration of the Greek term for Egypt, ""Aegyptus"". So, Coptic Christians referred to themselves according to their religion and were present in Algeria-Tunisia for a while even if itinerantly.

Also, it’d be wise if she downloads an app called “Flo” , then you’ll be able to get a good approximation of when safe periods are(highly recommended). If she has normal cycle, day5 is considered safe. But if you’d still be worried, there is an emergency pill that you can get from any pharmacy (otc) that works for up to 5 days after unprotected sex.

Sue that MF. And if you can't, ask others for help. You can DM me too. And If you feel like it's not worth it **at this time**, that's okay. Who cares about those damn pictures over there? You can get your revenge at a later time.

You are still young. The world is HUGE, and there are countless opportunities to meet nice people that you **never** imagined existed. Try to ignore the toxic people around you for good. You'll need to focus on getting the fuck outta there, **NOT** on trying to end your life. It's NOT your problem, it's **their** problem.

Come on.... We're all going to die at some point, **why the hurry tho?** Your life is so precious, and you will only live once.  


As I said, DM me at anytime. \^\^","i know a friend whom had the same experience i guess there is that one good therapist in sousse called souhail , she is way better after ig 3 years of appointments","You can visit Razi emergency at any tile if you feel any kind of discomfort , you'll be taken care of well and it wouldn't be as expensive as a private doctor visit.

Anyway, to answer your question, my psychiatrist is Olfa Makni Hajji in Cité El khadhra if you live in Tunis, she is amazing and literally changed my life.. 
BPD is painful but very treatable as long as effort is put in, I  had consistent therapy for 2 years ( monthly sessions ) and now I only had 1 session this year  I learned to manage my emotions and am living my best life.. I used to have suicidal thoughts EVERY single day of my being and now I am very grateful for my life.. I mean, recovery is a journey with ups and downs but it is beautiful and VERY worth it.. I don't know how  your  finances are, but please make it your priority to get help over spending your money on meaningless temporary pleasures like drinking, drugs etc..

Because a man shall take care of himself, showing emotions between 2 (or more) females is cute and shit and they be consolidating each other and maybe they cry in groups or whatever...

On the other hand, female friends as you said are more open about their struggles so I find it easier to relate to them and be more emotional with them.

My parents have given me a credit card with a large sum of money for me to freely use while studying away from them . I use this money mainly for food since meklt resteau is shit . But when given the chance i buy a few items of clothes (primarily frippe) or makeup .
Since the start of the year i have stupidly spent almost 70% of the money . How can i minimize my spending even more so when the year ends i ll still have a reasonable sum . 
i have stopped buying makeup and clothes for the meantime, now i only buy food/vegetables/chicken etc and water. What else can i do ? Honestly i want to find even a small job so i can get some of the money back into the account before im fkd but with my uni schedule its almost impossible.","yo I spent 3 years away from home and am also a broke uni student, here's how i can survive on 100 dinars a month sometimes more:

_Food and drinks: 

either learn how to cook cheap meals like chakchouka/3ejja/ma9rouna/mar9a or just put on your big girl pants and eat at the restaurant, it may be shit but it's still better than spending 4000 kol youm 3la casse croutet (if you only eat out during lunch time).

when you're with your parents buy things that'll last you the period you're away for breakfast, like wholesale tropico or brownies or something that can last a long time

Always buy water in bulk and in 2L (you could buy one of those Tupperware bottle things when you're with your parents to take some water with you to uni)

NEVER EVER EVER buy anything ml buvette, this one is obvious. t7eb 9ahwa ? bara l 9ahwa cha3biya 74a l fac

_clothing and makeup:

I'd say don't buy anything until it's time for you to go back home, or don't buy anything at all. But I understand it can be tempting, so I suggest you watch for sales and always always calculate how much you're willing to spend and never go beyond that. this goes the same way with make up.

_transportion: 

LEARN YOUR AREA!! get a bus subscription and keep it on you 24/7 (you can put it in your phone case). Considering that almost all universities have both public and student bus lines crossing them, learn how to navigate and exploit that. You can either ask l guichet win station or your classmates

Just before you do anything, always plan your spendings for the entire week and put a limit to how much you're throwing away on unimportant things","As a student in Tunis, I receive 200Dt monthly for my expenses.

-Opt for a 6-bottle pack of 2-liter water instead of buying individual bottles.

18horm7,https://i.redd.it/2us2yfvg446c1.jpg,51,Save money easily,,"""Bankers hate him, for using this one cool trick to pay off all his debts, click to know""","Just clarifying some points here since I've noticed a lot of misinformation being presented as facts without much economic context. I'm neither a supporter of KS nor a Tunisian, so consider this an impartial view.

Let's start with some facts: Tunisia, pre-revolution, had a low deficit and relatively low debt at around 40%, which enabled the government to have low service costs on the debt owed to foreign creditors. Moving fast forward to the mid-2010s, the deficit increased tenfold while the debt substantially rose to reach 77% of local GDP, making it difficult for governments to meet their debt obligations. Couple that with Covid spending, and you arrive at today, where the debt crisis has reached its peak.

Then comes the global mechanism for credit ratings, where Tunisia is facing exorbitant rates for borrowing costs, being the highest in the continent at 27.5%, compared to the second-highest, Egypt, at 12%. This, I hope explains to you why it is such a challenging task to pay off those debts.

I don't believe the KS government is necessarily in the wrong when it comes to managing debt. I think they rejected IMF conditions, which isn't necessarily bad since study after study has shown that IMF austerity measures rarely have a positive impact on the economy.

Some poster below said that the debt increased, and I quote, 'The funny thing is he didn't even pay debt in the sense that everyone thinks he did. Our debt slightly increased since 2022.' It did, yes, but that's just a simplified view of economics. It actually went down even when it increased, which is a natural outcome of having a mountain of debt with a high yield to pay. I won't go deep into whatever policies have been made, but the debt went down from 79.9% in 2022 to 76% of gdp as of Sep 2023. Note that a study by the IMF in 2018 presented a best-case scenario where, if Tunisians were to impose austerity and cut all subsidies (and it didn't even account for Covid), the debt-to-GDP ratio would be at 74%, if I recall correctly. So honestly, my take is that not having austerity, being subjected to the highest borrowing cost in the continent - unfairly, in my opinion - and still almost hitting the mark is impressive.

I think 2024/5 will be a good indicator of the economic direction this government is going.

Our main issues stem from a struggling economy and weak currency, causing low salaries, like a minimum wage of 390 for a 40-hour week and 460 for a 48-hour week. To boost salaries, we should stop state subsidies on things like bread and sugar (except maybe oil, which makes a profit) but it still doesn't make sense for someone with a 300K car or living abroad to pay the same as someone with a Peugeot 206.

We also need to fix our deficit-ridden public companies. Many have more employees than necessary. We could expand their functions to make them more productive, or we might have to let go of some employees to cut costs and make profits. Another option is privatizing non-essential companies, like those producing cigarettes, which are in the red and costing the state money, by privitazing them the state will make money off taxes.

If we make our public companies profitable, the government will have more money. This could lead to reducing taxes, which I believe is a major cause of our current inflation. I'm proposing we follow a socio-democratic model like many European countries, with free education, healthcare, and public transport. Instead of subsidies for everyone, let's provide direct social aid to families in need.

But to make these changes, we need a bold leader at the helm, not a bunch of fools. It'll take time, but if we don't act now to change our economic structure, by voting to the right people we'll keep facing the same problems.

 ","Weak currency is a non issue, unstable currency is a big problem.","Firstly, your desire to lower taxes while advocating for an extensive social benefit system seems paradoxical to me. Where do you think the government will get the money for those programs? Either you support a free market or you don't; you can't selectively choose. The government's involvement in owning and supporting companies will tip the scale of competition towards the government, effectively picking winners and losers in the market.

Privatization means job losses like you said, and in this case, it will disproportionately impact the middle class. Coupled with the reduced taxation you suggest, there will be an increased demand for benefits, resulting in more debt and inflation. Your proposed economic model essentially copies that of Peronist Argentina, you can google Argentina's economy and see how that ended up working for them. 

You don't need a bold leader to get the economy back on track; this isn't the bachelor. What you need are competent ministries and low corruption. Tunisia needs to make substantial investments in education and infrastructure while working to improve public sector efficiency. Factors like transparency, reduced bureaucracy, and a well-educated workforce can serve the economy better in the short term than slashing taxes without economic planning.

Taxation is strongly linked with the fiscal planning of the country, and this is an issue that should be shared between the Ministry of Finance and legislators, not resting solely on the shoulders of a bold leader, again, the economy isn't the bachelor. Achieving fiscal stability, and guaranteeing the state's responsibility towards managing public finances effectively can lead to better credit ratings internationally, resulting in improved access to financing Tunisia's projects through debt. Improving the rule of law, private property protections, and facilitating access to arbitration are factors that will increase the ease of doing business in Tunisia, attracting foreign direct investment as a result.

Regarding subsidies, streamlining and reviewing them is something that I agree with. However, to execute this efficiently, it's crucial to consider the impact cutting them off will have. An efficient government would have conducted a census, working out the population most in need to help directly, and reducing subsidies in stages to mitigate the impact on the society. 

Finally, Tunisia has a lot going for it. However, consistently blaming the government undervalues the capabilities of the people of Tunisia. While it's true that the government plays a crucial role in shaping the economy, there is still work to be done at the local level. This includes collaborating to prevent and condemn low-level corruption, partnering with local municipalities to reduce bureaucracy, advocating for e-government, supporting local art and produce, and enhancing the local aesthetic through community beautification projects. Small investments, such as a few paint buckets, brooms, and planting pots, may not strain the budget for a small community but could significantly improve life for everyone, fostering increased economic activity in the local community. Yes, I know a colorful wall won't get you your dream job, but it symbolizes a change of culture, and that is what will get you that job eventually. 

I could write extensively on many small steps that can be taken, but the common perception people have is that change must come from above, waiting for a messiah to magically transform Tunisia, it neglects the reality that a good policy alone won't fix a bad culture. Real change starts with the people. Those words were written with love, so don't come at me with how great Tunisian culture is, I think it is.","I agree with you but I'm no quite sure where to start mainly because such changes cannot be made overnight and do require careful treatment. The reason for that is simple: People resist change. An abrupt change in policies and in the overall structure of our economic institutions could potentially lead to social issues. We all seem to know that our economic growth is in decline and  that the quality of human capital we have is insufficient to maintain an acceptable level of productivity let alone to keep up with globalization. There seem to be a lot of structural weaknesses in our political/economic institutions and there are also flaws inherent to the current work force.  I'm by no means an expert in this field, but I don't think that's an easy thing to do. I ask myself sometimes, why don't the experts take such initiatives? could it be that they're **all** deep in corruption, ignorant to the situation or is there actually something reasonable stopping them? As you have already said, we need a strong leader to simultaneously handle all of these issues. I wonder who's that gonna be.","The solution is not complicated tbh but whoever will do it will face backlash from the people, some may starve.

I know that questions about dating, especially from foreigners, can be recieved very poorly in most countries subs. I understand that.

That being said:

I'm a 28 year old male who moved to Tunis for work. I've been here for 3 months and recently started using Tinder here. 

I've matched with a lot of cool looking women, with interesting bio's. But here's the problem:

When I talk to them, all conversations seem to be the same:

I say something or ask a question, and I get a very simple reply back (sometimes just a word) and no follow up question.

 For example, where I'm from, I would ask: ""what do you do for work?"" or (if their interest is reading) ""what book are you reading now?""

And the girl will reply something like:

""I work in marketing. What about you?""

But in Tunisia, women reply ""I work in marketing"". Without a follow up question or anything. 

So where I'm from, this means the girl is not interested and is just being polite. So in my own country I would stop the conversation there. And I did that here too. But then the weird thing is, if I leave the conversation at this point in Tunisia, often a few days later I'll get a follow up question from the same girl. But then when I ask a question again, I get a monosyllabic response again and the cycle repeats a few days later. 

So what I did is I just asked on of these girls out, and we actually had a few nice dates (though that was it since she didn't live in Tunis and went back home). And in real life, this girl was fun, open and engaged the whole time. But i could never have predicted that from the way she was in Tinder!

And I really don't want to say ""all girls from Tunisia behave like this on Tinder"" but honestly... I have yet to find an exception. This makes me realize that, since I am the foreigner, I am doing something wrong and not adapting to the Tunisian tinder ways. So my question is: How is a Tinder conversation supposed to go in Tunisia? How do women like to be talked to? I'd really like your ideas!

And I hope this is not offending anybody.","it's a very simple math.

Girl has 30 minutes to spend on Tinder.

(non-Tunisian) girl engages in 10-15 minutes conversations with 2-3 best options of that day.

(Tunisian) girl throws one word to each one of the 100 guys who contacted her that day.

That's it.","When I was single I had kinda similar experiences in Tunisia (and not just with Tinder). At first the girl wouldn't seem interested at all and not ask any questions, just to come back a few days later with things like ""why did you stop talking to me???""  
Like omg, in my country you not asking me any questions would mean that you'd want me to stop talking to you haha","You will eventually get matched with someone who doesn’t behave like this. Keep looking.
Although the more attractive they are the more likely it is to go this way, i think it’s usually due to some childish entitlement.",😂 nah that’s normal behaviour from Tunisian women,"Tunisians don't take tinder too seriously, people will only use it when extremely bored or lonely, so they're looking for a stand out - out of the box starter to catch their interest. Girls get similar messages from everyone on tinder so it gets repetitive and boring which is why they reply poorly with no follow up questions.
I personally never answer questions like what do you do for work from strangers. It serves no purpose.

As for the follow up you get days later don't take it personally,as I've mentioned previously ppl here don't take tinder seriously so they don't spend much time on it.",2023-12-12 11:47:15

I've been trying to understand the marriage laws in Tunisia, and I'm a bit confused. Traditionally, Islam is known to allow polygamy and cousin marriage, not allowing Muslim women to marry non-Muslims. However, I recently learned that in Tunisia, polygamy is illegal.

I'm also curious about cousin marriage and its potential risks for birth defects or genetic issues – if anyone has information on this, I'd appreciate some insights. if you want to understand these issues better, I found a video that delves into these questions: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyNP3s5mxI8&t=14s)

Moreover, is it true that non-Muslim women in Tunisia are allowed to marry non-Muslim men? I thought there were restrictions in other Muslim-majority countries, but I've heard Tunisia has a more progressive approach.

Have there been recent changes in these laws, or am I misunderstanding something? I don't mean to be disrespectful; I just want to learn. Please, let's keep the discussion respectful and share any explanations or resources you can provide.

Thanks in advance!","1. Polygamy is banned since 1956 in Tunisia. Culturally, it's seen as retrogaded and stupid by a large part of the population

2. Cousin Mariage is legal to the 2nd degree. Used to be the norm, Nowadays isn't for a majority of the population, you can still find it in remote places

3. Interfaith couples are legal for men since 1956 and since 2019 or 2018 for women. Culturally, it depends on the level of pratice of the tunisian family: if they are not very praticing they may accept a white catholic or agnostic, or an asian Also, people in Tunisia tend to care more about the color of the skin than the religion. That's why a marriage with a black person is often disregarded unfortunately even if the person is muslim","1) polygamy is banned
2) cousin marriage isn't regulated by laws, but premarital medical consultation do warn couples about potential risks

I am an algerian indie artist. I do concept art, character and creature design and mentorship for the previous on a hobbyist or a professional level both. continuously expanding my skillset (hopefully to more content creation for educational content and more forms of media).  


I've constantly struggled with how locked of a country and unsupportive Algeria is to individual activities, especially with working with international clients and partners.  
Currently I don't even have a card that would allow me to receive pay and accessing one has not only been a struggle but also halted my professional activities as a whole.  


I would love to move abroad. but for a short term solution, I'd love to migrate to Tunisia temporarily since it's much less of a jump or a change of living climate. also Tunisia seems like a sweet place and i'd love to see and share the culture, work aside.  


This is still on the planning phase and looking for options. I'm inquiring to evaluate how viable it would  be and I'd move only once It's safe and I can smoothly integrate there.

Downtown Tunis, you can visit the old Medina city where you can explore the old Arabian city lifestyle, and try some traditional food.

Nearby, I recommend visiting la Goulette, cozy bars, good restaurants, a good Tunisian vibe.

La Marsa too.

A bit far, I'd recommend Zriba al-Olia in  Zaghouan (40 miles - 65 km) from Tunis. You can also try a traditional Hammam (natural hot baths) in Hammam Zriba which is also in Zaghouan.

Soon after, my initial reply that was sitting at 3 upvotes got downvoted to oblivion, and his reply got insta upvoted by 16 (now it's sitting at much more)

Upon checking his history, I found out that the same thing kept happening whenever he replied and started attacking someone.

Here is my comment:

>Shakshuka is Tunisian food, it is not Jewish. The reason why it's in Palestine/Israel is because:  
>  
>1- We have Jews in Djerba who travel back and forth to Israel  
>  
>2- Arabs tend to 'borrow' foods from different arab countries, and so do Palestinians (we have Shawarma and Falafel in Tunisia for example)

&#x200B;

so he replied:

>Whether you like it or not, whether you assimilate or discriminate against Jews, our 2,000 years in the diaspora is an inseparable part of our identity and culture. A Palestinian has no more right to North African food because it was colonized by Arabs than the descendants of an Israeli culture of which North African Jewry has become an inseparable part of.

&#x200B;

I wrote a [15 minute reply](https://pastebin.com/gNbyLNmD) under him explaining that we Tunisians are not racist and that I never even tried to attack anyone, but my reply got shadow banned. Every further reply got shadow banned ever since. There was even one ignorant guy claiming that Shakshuka wasn't Tunisian in his opinion, and my response to him still got shadow banned.

First of all, you should compare to 2019-2021 because 2022-2023 are Saied years and shortages did start in 2022.

Second, out of these products the one we don't produce much locally and have to import decreased (ble tendre/farina, corn, soja). So basically this indicates that we did actually cut total quantities for the ones we have to import.

The ones that increased are ones where local production is important and dropped significantly. Of course imports of milk increased but it's a very negative thing because we used to export it. The regime destroyed the milk chain of production so just because we're importing more doesn't mean we fulfilled our needs, it means our local production which was not just enough for all of Tunisia but enough to sell milk to our neighbours was fucked and the only people responsible for destroying it is Saied and co who refused to raise prices for populism and now are paying 4x to import milk.

The same thing applies to potatoes which you single out here. They arrested people for keeping potatoes in freezers so Tunisian farmers stopped producing them so we had to import. It doesn't mean the local market had enough potatoes, it just means Tunisian potatoes disappeared because of the stupid regime that scared farmers into not producing them. The fact that imports increased should be a scandal not a positive thing for the regime.

The same thing applies to wheat/ble dur. We had an absolutely horrible season with almost 0 local production so of course we're going to import more. It's not a positive thing and it doesn't mean we imported enough.

Also since you're discussing this how can you explain tea imports going to 0 and coffee imports being cut by 95% while the government claims they imported enough? It's a blatant lie so what are we even discussing here when the government itself at the same time admits to not importing when publishing numbers and then when talking they say they imported? There's no argument to be made but instead they rely on blind supporters who they know are too stupid to read numbers anyways.

Here's the balance for 2020-2021 attached. Why did we import nearly no potatoes back then but they were available when Tunisian producers weren't arrested for storing it? Why did we consistently import over 1100kT in ble tendre/farina back then but only in 2023 we imported 975kT and suddenly there's shortages? Why did Tunisia import less milk back then but milk was more than available and now it isn't (hint: it's because local production was destroyed by Saied)?

18ev2zo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/18ev2zo/tunisias_chronically_high_npl_ratio_and_its/,7,Tunisia's Chronically High NPL Ratio And Its Effect On The Local Economy,"NPL stands for non-performing loan, and it is given that label when the borrower ceases to make monthly payments on the loan or its interest. Typically, a loan earns this designation after several months of non-repayment by the borrower. The NPL ratio is measured to assess the credit risk in the banking sector and the quality of outstanding loans in the economy. A higher ratio indicates significant risk in the banking sector, potentially leading to losses. This is usually symptomatic of a struggling economy.

NPLs are detrimental to banks as they can result in great losses, impacting the banks' performance and their ability to extend loans to businesses and retail customers. Economy also will feel the burnt of that. 

Here are the NPL ratios of some countries for comparison: Saudi Arabia 1.7%, Morocco 8.8%, Jordan 4.5%, Egypt 3.5%, Algeria 20.3%, Peru 3.7%, Chile 2%, Turkey 1.5%, and Tunisia 11%.

Typically, a ratio above 5% signals trouble. Although Tunisia's ratio is at 11%, it is the lowest in decades, having reached almost 20% under Ben Ali and hovered around 15% in the past decade. The current Central Bank has implemented a policy requiring all banks to reduce their NPL ratios to below 7% by 2026. 

Even before this policy, banks were forced to raise interest rates on lending to compensate for the elevated risk resulting from the high percentage NPLs in their assets, tightening loan access as a result. While this policy is sound, it will pose additional challenges for the average customer in the upcoming years regarding borrowing, up until 2026 at least. 

Research indicates that a high NPL ratio causes the economy to lose 2% of growth annually. The current policy of gradually lowering the ratio is expected to benefit the economy in the long term. However, a more effective solution would involve the government acquiring these bad loans through public asset management company and working to resolve them. This approach would allow the banking sector to recover more rapidly, fostering a quicker economic growth. Unfortunately, I give in that the government lacks the resources to implement such a solution at the moment. 

While reducing the NPL ratio might not serve as a magical solution for the Tunisian economy, as evidenced by Egypt, it will result with a much-needed growth. It's also a step is in the right direction for improving Tunisia's fiscal health.","Imo think our government is big enough. Having the government to subsidy NPLs would only make it bigger and worse. Our state owned companies have proven to be a complete disaster (except for some).

But this is my personal opinion and I'm not an expert so I'm open to more educated people on the matter.",how would this get changed with the latest interest payment information release by the goverment ? is this before of after those numbers got released ?,,,,2023-12-10 04:05:28

I have achieved a fit body, I'm working on my future, I regulated porn to once per week.

That's all side quests being worked on, just need patience.

My big problem is personality, sociability, communication, making relationships, any type of relations. Whatever you want ""it"" called. forming connections with other people basically.

I'm 20 and I figured out that's all i want really. Every other objective (or sidequest heh) I had/have is out of insecurity while this is the one and only thing I truly want. Absolutely nothing else forreal.

I go school, everybody just wants me to help them out with something, just 3bed ta3 masale7.

I go outside, hitting convos with randoms is easy, all you gotta do is find something you both would like to complain about, I pretty can't swing the convo any other way with randos.

I go gym, I despise talking there, the little bit of focus I have despite the loud shitty music gets drained if I talk so I just stick by myself. NOT willing to talk here besides salem salem 9adeh mezelk mn serie with the occasional convo once a month or two.

other than necessary objectives like a career or health, my goals in life are pretty minuscule: get friends, friends to share going to concerts, the beach, drink with, get invited to parties, get a gf, dates, cinema, someone to spoil, fucking, cuddling.

As for the socializing part, the best way to get better at it(at least in my opinion) is to join charity organisations / clubs , especially within your uni. If you're not a student, you can join croissant rouge.

a lot of people do recommend charities and organisations that do work with other people. i would also reocmmend seeing how to get in a more business relationship with porn and social media. if your case is not a mental dissorder, which i think it isn't, getting into the porn and/or social media business (not that they do intersect mcuh) would let you see them as they really are, and will help you transition from the hold they might have on you. 

But with more honesty, there is something called ""growing up"" and ""doing what you think suits you/is right"", if youa re still in your 20s, you have a high chance of getting over those mental blocks just by giving yourself some leway (if that's the correct word).   
you know, it's totally fine to have friends and have porn and social media related issues at the same time, there is no real rules when it comes to people's compositions.","Consult a shrink, it can be helpful",You think hitting the gym will fix ur life?,2023-12-09 22:00:27

They will work HARD, day and night to get there. It also helps that most of those who get to legally immigrate are of a certain background (highly educated, hungry for sucess, money and power ...).

That being said, being a neet is fun ... for a while ... when you are still in your early 20's. Maybe you can push it until you are into your mid 20's. After that, the party is over.

It gets you a breather from the ""rat race"".Two years is a bit too much, if you are not trying anything to move on with your life. Three is just ... Nope.

Right now, I'm struggling to memorize a lot of word. It's frustrating because I used to memorize many words to understand Arabic for exams when I was a kid, but it didn't work and now I hate it. Most students in my school struggle with French and English, while they understand Arabic well. Unfortunately, I am not allowed to choose the language i study.

I get annoyed when adults are telling me not to fail in Arabic (+ philosophy + history + geography) exams. Why can't I remove them? They are the least important in the computer science section, which I chose. I attend Arabic class every Monday and Thursday for two hours each week. However, I only have English class on Tuesdays for two hours and only French class on Wednesdays for two hours instead of having two classes in either English or French.

At the end of the road you have goals to graduate and move to the next step,

You can not change the rules of the game, but you can definitely choose how much to be affected by the rules that do not make sense to you. 

Student life is hard in a sense that there is a very limited effort and time to study while there is a lot of distractions. 

A lot of students get hampered in their results not because of their intelligence but because of their ability to stay balanced, stay engaged, stay focused and to manage their emotional state. 

I was a moody student, i discarded many subjects due to teachers or disinterest, this did create more stress as it created more pressure on other subjects. 

This also left me unprepared for future life challenges where i needed to take actions on things that i was not good at and or did not feel like doing. 

Eventually everyone graduated but i had a lot of inbalance in my work/life style as i would end up getting impacted in my personal life due to my difficulties to get things done. 


I dont know your current situation with enough detail, My recommendation to my past myself is to put effort in finding a balance that would allow me to manage my emotions and to find a sustainable and organised way of dealing with studies and other areas of life, that and to take some hobbies that challenge those weaknesses of mine.

Whatever you decide to spend effort on now, however pointless, ineffective, uncomfortable, boring or silly it feels, no effort is really lost, it's just that some effort will bring fruits much later in life, it's just hard to see in the beginning and easy to see later. 

Whatever happens now is temporary, and More and more silly and illogical challenges are awaiting students after studies, in the end, none of them are worth our frustrations, or worth stressing about, and getting them done makes a resilient person ready for life lemons.","This might be an unpopular opinion but those subjects are important.
Let us start with Arabic and with facts: every language you learn improves your neuroplasticity and your cognitive skills in general. Moreover, if you aim to study CS, you will see the advantages it will give you to master a completely different language when you come to the subjects of computer linguistics and theoretical computer science. 

Philosophy is another subject you’ll come to be grateful for as a CS student, if you pay good attention in secondary school. Philosophy, maths and CS are very closely connected and if the curriculum is somehow still the same as 30+ years ago you will learn a lot about logic, linguistics (again) and language as a vehicle for thought. 

Now, you might not need history and geography for CS but they will help you be a better person, that can understand the world you live in and how you should walk through life. Ibn Khaldun realized over 600 years ago that civilizations lived in cycles and it’s important to learn those patterns and their triggers and rationales in history and geography (beyond the regurgitation of facts and figures)

If you would take the advice of a much older computer scientist, I would recommend you try to understand why you are experiencing difficulties with Arabic if you are able to excel in other languages and take it from there.",2023-12-09 19:06:42

ofc,  you'll move to the next step if the current was successful

So the hr interview, generally it's an exchange about your personal infos, education, hobbies, experiences, achievements and ofc you'll be asked the standard questions (like ""why should we hire you?"")

In the tech interview, you will be asked for every technical thing you put on your resume and discuss about your IT experiences and maybe get some problem solving tasks.

""Tunisian intelligence and uniqueness"" is a concept infused by Bourguiba at the time he was building a young nation.

Also, for a country with almost no natural resources, your only bet is to tell people they are unique to get the best of them. 
Since then, the myth was perpetuated and gradually taken for granted. The random Tunisian has pride, which is good but where things go wong is when you're disconnected from the world and still live with old myths. It's may be a kinda escaping reality. 
Tunisians are among the citizens that travel the less, of course that green passport has a lot to do with this, and  if they did, they will discover that we're average people, we're not that smart and we're not that brillant as we think. Saw a lot of us mocking others, while we have absolutely no idea about them.

Tnajem taaml licence then you apply for an engineering school (à condition que les relevées de notes ykounou gonflés), ama les places disponibles par école ykounou limitées aalekher and there's no guarantee that you'd get accepted.

&#x200B;

Pros:

* You learn to be rigorous.
* You get used to mathematical notation and concepts, meaning that you won't find much trouble if you want to get yourself into a career that requires mathematical modeling.

Cons:

* Focuses too much on theoretical stuff.
* Intense schedule.
* Usually undermines extracurricular activities.
* Can sometimes be stressful.

Hi,

I wanted to learn a dialect but couldn't find any massive dictionnary or courses where i could learn a lot of words.

I found and loved the [https://derja.ninja/](https://derja.ninja/)  website, so I made a script to get (in order) the top 20.000 english  words. I found 11.300 word and their translation, + 0 to 3 sample  sentences, and the audio with it.

This is not perfect, as some pretty common words weren't found (like ""i"",""am"",""want"" ...

The deck is available on the Anki platform for free [https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1875413457](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1875413457)

The cards look like this

Do you really think that 50+ countries with no economic integration whether in terms of regulations, infrastructure, development or even fiscally suddenly will have smooth trading? Not to mention unstable political status many countries in the continent have. You will have countries dumping their cheap products onto other countries, farmers losing their livelihood simply because they can't compete with more developed farmers who can scale up their productions, you will have countries falling into debt simply to finance infrastructure to be able to conduct this free trade, you will have local industries decimated because they can no longer compete in open market, or simply when labor gets costly they will relocate their factory elsewhere to cheapest available market and this in a region struggling to retain industrial output, you will have multinational corporations strong arming the continent into bad agreements in order to enable them to exploit as many as possible. Not to mention the environmental issues, the severe corruption, and the lack of fair and common framework for arbitrage, which will lead to stronger countries abusing the agreement and impoverishing weaker ones further.

Please though, be considerate when it comes to numbers / currency. The currency of our country is the dinar (TND) not millime. It is thus not 14 milyar but 14 malyoun TND.

To put things in perspective, 14 million TND is equivalent to \~4.6 million USD. This means that on average, each of the 140 people is required to pay \~ 32.000 USD (\~ 100.000 tnd or 100 malyoun franc).

Don’t let numbers fool you, the total amount (14 malyoun dinar) is really inconsequential. It is barely enough to pay the salaries of **8.000** cops or **10.000** teachers for a month.

I'll try to be brief. I've had a military higher education in a very niche speciality. There's only 348 of us active and in duty right now. Everything about my work and trainiijng has been tailored to keeps us in Tunisia (naturally underpaid like everyone is, and without much room for growth) 

So at age 35, I feel like a cog in a rusty machine. Unable to do much to help change things and living under my projected aspirations. 

Recently I landed a contract, like a big one, abroad. I'm not hesitant about it. I've filed for technical cooperation where I'll be paying some 15% of my annual revenue to the Tunisian pension scheme (cnrps). 

However my management is making this difficult, if not impossible, and they risk me missing my contract. I'm seriously thinking that I should leave and let them do what they will. I'm leaving yes, but I want it to be on good terms and in a way that'll allow me to help myself and family without hassle. Any advice is welcome.","Hi there! The Tunisian administration is so stubborn and short sighted, they don't see the benefit of what you are trying to do.  
My sister went through the same, she landed a very good contract abroad as a doctor, she wanted to go through cooperation process, but her bosses made it so difficult and complicated, she was gonna miss the whole thing, so she just left with a very short notice and did not wait for their approval. She did that because she knew that she can't face any legal charges. You on the contrary are in the military, which can be different legally, so check what are the risks if you decide to leave anyways. Check if you can quit your job (knowing that you probably can't come back) and screw the good terms, if they stand in your way t achieve your goals, walk over them","are you a pilote ?

because only 382 and from the military in tunisia only the military train to be a pilote or you gonna need barcha flous","First step is to leave, next is to deal with whatever your institution has with you, but from abroad, you cant risk losing what you have for morals or ethics.

Tunisia is just one good government away from a better future. 

You have low external debts (Yes, I know), but it's still low compared to others.

Think of this as just some crazy rambles by me, but these are achievable steps that need to be taken for Tunisia to break free from its misery:

* Strengthen state institutions, regardless of whether they are democratic or autocratic. Shift to e-government to reduce corruption involving middlemen.

* Gain a firm grip on state finances. Even if there's a deficit, a strong grip is a must.

* Improve the rule of law, increase policing, and enhance safety.

Once you achieve all of the above, you can move to stage 2:

* Get massively in debt, but for good reasons such as investing in new infrastructure (airports, roads, trains, water, and energy), establishing new industry and technology parks, renovating and making cities more appealing for high-end tourism and, of course, their own residents, education and health. 

* Create business-friendly laws because investors will be eager to invest in Tunisia if you reach this point.

* Gradually embrace a free market and reduce existing protections on pricing as the debt rises. This will be eased by the economic growth resulting from the debt.

Not even my own plan lol, it's been done over and over again by every single developed country.","Tunisia is a hole in the time/place continuum, controlled by a number of big filthy rich families, where everything you see or experience is designed with the purpose of either confusing, or distracting you.

- finish your frist contract and get paid

- use your upwork account to create a payoneer account and link it with your real bank account (no hiding anything, it's all legal)

- use your Id to verify your payoneer account

- use upwork to fund your account regularly and try to get to more than 10k inflow to get the reduced fees

Because the person does not have to be Tunisian and/or living in Tunisia but he has to do with Tunisia. He can be a Tunisian but living abroad. Or maybe a person who will have a huge effect on Tunisia for example durring that year. But then again, we all know that the person will be 99.9% of the times Tunisian. The declaration of the winner will be on the 6th of December every year. This year's (2023) person of the year is Belgacem. 

The motivation is the following ""through his contribution to the Reddit community of Tunisia and with his multiple accounts on the site, Belgacem got many Tunisian teenagers and young adults to look at the world differently. He made countless people believe in themselves and  retrieve hope in the future. Belgacem knows everything and he is constantly teaching others the art of life and there are no people on Earth he was so determined to help like his own countrymen"". 

Well, let us see who wins the Belgacem Person of the Year award in 2024. Results will be published on 2024/12/06

It depends on your interests, but a good starting point is discovering what people your age do and where they go. From there, you can choose a path that resonates with you.

If you have difficulties communicating with others or you're overly shy, you've got to work on that first. As social creatures, initiating connections with new people often leads to introductions to others, expanding your circle of friends.

Small cheese factories aren't even finding milk to buy and a lot of farmers want to sell the liter for over 2k. They should have taxed products like yogurts which are always present even though there's a shortage in milk. I can't believe 1kg of Edame increased by average 10 dinars..  


They are forcing artisanal products to go extinct (not only cheese) and are pushing the crappily manufactured by big companies (Hi delice danone) products, I wouldn't even be surprised that it was pushed by a lobby to make big companies get more profit. I wish milk was even of good quality, the quality of milk we have in Tunisia compared to other countries is really bad and just filled with water. The milk that we all buy ""demi"" is basically just water and only has 20-30% cream while the milk that the average citizens buys in other countries is with full cream.",Fuck them and go buy contraband dutch masdam gruyere from marché central b 3400/100gr,Worst and worst every day and BTW they are not allowing  cheese  importation as well.,2023-12-05 19:39:26

They still have costs and some of those are higher in Tunisia like import taxes (60% in Tunisia) and even shipping costs. It's not necessarily that they want to be a luxury brand based on Tunisia's avg purchase power, it's the government that wants these to be luxury items so most people can't buy them and they import less.

A side-effect of this policy is there's also less competition in Tunisia because not many brands want to deal with Tunisia's bureaucracy/import tariffs/small market/unpredictability...etc so they get to raise their prices even more","That's true. 

Abroad such brands are aimed at middle income consumers that wanna look trendy and therefore they're not items made to last or of superior quality.

Once you ship these items here, plus taxes plus a trendy location's rent etc they'll end up being pricey and honestly not worth the cost anymore.

I'd imagine the consumers buying these items are either naive tourists or people that just want to buy branded clothes; similar to those that go to Starbucks for a coffee when you can get a way better coffee at a fraction of the cost elsewhere.",i just buy used,Chouf fripe w zid 5ayet 3and l5ayata echti 9mech li t7eb 3lih ...,2023-12-04 20:27:05

- Do not ""tod5el byeddek w sa9ik fi matahet idara""   so, never do the law / legal process by yourself. find a good lawyer  / law experts, then, let him do the administrative papers for you.   ( this step may cost you money, but, trust me its better than do the legal work by yourself. )
because if you start by yourself, you will hate yourself.

- Try to find an international brand to work with, even if its not a very know brand. if you can find a business man / international brand who can work with you, the local market will be happy to work with you. also, the process to get a permit from the gouvernment will be easier.

-  Do not start big !   if they find that your project is profitable, the ""big fishs"" will do everything to make you loose & abandant your project.  so, when start your legal process & administrative papers, let the know that you will only sell you product on your city / the few cities near your cities.  let your ambitions low. after you get your permits / licences, then, F**K them & sell your products everywhere you can.  the difficult step is to get permits, so, try hard to get it.

- Never invest all your money in the project.  make sure that you have the possibility to move outside the country when they cause you problems.","My advice hire a professional to get this kind information and guide you through the process (lawyer + expert comptable).

I would do the same for the wine making, wine making although not necessarily difficult remain an art. So you probably want to hire a professional winemaker as well to help you set up production and guide you through the process the first couple of years. Although Spanish and Italian wine making consultants are very good they tend to be expensive, so don't hesitate to hire an Argentinian, Chilean or South-african.

Good luck, can't wait to drink your wines.","U probably wanna start with a market research because I don’t think , Tunisians are ur target.
I m not actually surprised when u said u did not find anything on the internet because if there is anything in the laws about this or any other field for that matter , they just throw u a pdf and expect u to read the whole 200 page pdf(if u find something that is ). 
About consultants , i assume u know a winery in Tunisia (or any competitor ) if not , I don’t think u would want a consultant that never touched this kinda work before. Ur best bet is to actually talk to restaurant/bar about this because they are ur constant and reliable clients. 
Other than all of this xD , in Tunisia , it is so hard to get a permit to sell any kind of alcoholic beverages let alone manufacture em 😂 .
Last but not least , if u can or are open to , u might wanna forget about winery business as a whole in Tunisia and do another kind of project that people need or do it in another country . It is just too risky and expensive. 
This is not a financial advice , but just keep it in mind while u go through the whole thing.

I was wondering if anyone has been there recently and can advise me on how safe/unsafe it actually is? It’s often better to hear from people who actually live in the area on what’s the best option. Thanks!",Totally safe like always don't go to villages near Libya's border thats it only those one little bit unsafe due to the state of libya obv,"safest place

Keep your ID with you in both cases.

After paying everything keep the receipt with you. If you drive around with that alcohol you need to show the receipt to show you bought it legally, if of course, needed. It's rare tho but good to keep in mind. 

Other than that everything goes normally.",It's the same process as any other kind of groceries,"No, you just go in and buy",hahaha my first time I was nervous as shit and I was a minor too. I kept stumbling on my words and dropping shit like my wallet because of how nervous I was I was the most suspicious and obvious minor on the planet. then the cashier just scanned it and I left home lol. everything is normal and no ones cares basically. just bring your ID,"They might ask you for your ID, so have it ready just in case.

there is also   [**William Spaniel**](https://www.youtube.com/@Gametheory101)  who does videos on similar topics but in a different style (we call this one ""lines on maps"" guy, because it's something he uses to explain risk and reward in politics and militairy)

[**Binkov's Battlegrounds**](https://www.youtube.com/@Binkov) is another good one for militairy enthusiasts, he publishes news about the armament industry (new tanks, ships, planes), and occasionnaly does hypothetical battle scenarios, which are really fun

نهار  الثلاثاء ٢٠ سبتمبر ٢٠٠٥، انا مانيش في تونس اما لبرّة في افريقيا جنوب الصحراء 

في البانكا، بعدما علمتهم قبل بنهار الي باش نجيهم من غدوة للجبدان، اما قبل ما ندخل وانا في الباركينغ نركّح في الكرهبة جاني واحد متع الباركينغ وقالي حويجة، الفين فرنك، قلتلو  مافوقيش توّة، اما تو نقرالك حسابك في الرجوع كي العادة، وقتها يضهرلي يعمل العشرة متع الصباح 

سكت وضحك وقالي باهي 

دخلت للبانكا، وما خرجت الا بعد نص النهار منها اما جبدت فلوسي. جاو من البنك المركزي متاعهم في كميونة وجابولي فلوسي زوز افارقة جيش بمكاحل عيار ثقيل وصندوق قد الماهي كيما متع القراصنة اما حديد

وكي حسبت الفلوس من بعد نلقاهم ناقصين ورقة وحدة    من لفّة، يعني ٥٠ دينار طلعو هزوهم او الماكينة

I use vichy dercos antidandruff which deletes the existence of dandruff, but makes my hair looks super frizzy and horrible . I use for about a month, twice a week.

I then go back to using ketozol once or twice a week. ketozol is nowhere near as good as dercos for dandruff but it doesn't ruin the look of my hair so badly like dercos does, but hair still looks bad.

I opt for ketozol when I'm not using dercos because it's much cheaper.

Meanwhile I go to the gym about 4 to 5 times a week and everytime I use a shampoo that, for a while, made my hair look great.

While anti-dandruff shampoo (badly) straightens my hair, this one makes my hair look great and gives it curls for some reason. before this shampoo I only ever had curls when my hair is wet. It's this version of [cytolcap](https://pharma-shop.tn/19155-large_default/cytol-cytolcap-f-shampooing-fortifiant-revitalisant-200ml.webp). It let curls stay while my hair is dry and it was the best my hair looked ever in my life.

After the last round of using dercos (stopped about a month ago), Cytolcap does not make my hair look great anymore. If I can make cytolcap make my hair look great again, how please?

I personally believe sulfate is the bane of my existence since cheap shampoo like syoss ruins my hair and even cheaper ones just the same. But for some reason the red version of cytolcap made my hair look great while there's no mention that it doesn't have sulfate. I assume the sellers always mention the no sulfate thing because buyers, like me, gobble that shit up.

&#x200B;

This [picture](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/58F83WaMR7g/maxresdefault.jpg) of this dude wanting his hair to go from left to right.

My hair is like the right version, awful and frizzy. the red version of my shampoo calms down the hair and makes it look the left version more, which in my case, is better looking.

189da79,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/189da79/opportunity_vs_topic_pfe/,2,Opportunity vs Topic [PFE],"To provide context, I am currently in the final year of my engineering studies and am required to undertake a 4-6 month internship as my graduation project(PFE). My interest lies in the applications of AI, specifically in robotics, computer vision, and other engineering fields. Fortunately, I have secured a position in a world class institute. However, the proposed internship topic focuses on AI in Intrusion Detection systems, which does not interest me that much.

Upon researching the field, I've discovered that it is quite mature, and the internship would be pure research. Now, I find myself at a crossroads, debating whether to accept the offer and leverage the institute's network and resources (along with excellent living conditions) or to explore other opportunities. Unfortunately, securing a position in another prestigious institute seems unlikely, and my alternatives might involve local companies (which may be outdated) or universities abroad. 

Any advice or insights on this matter would be greatly appreciated.","You're asking us to decide instead of you, whereas I think you know very well the answer, follow what you really want and if better living conditions and opportunities will give you comfort working on something you are not interested in, go for it, keep on your mind every path you will take, you will have to prioritize some things over others.",if you’re unsure about it bcs its research don’t be i personally am not in the ai field but at first i thought research sucked but it turned out to be not too bad tbh i thought itd be hell it could open new opportunities,"Well, based on how you're putting it, you're leaning more toward the first option. You mentioned you are unlikely to land a similar opportunity with a good company. Scarcity creates value.

I'd recommend you seek the possibility of suggesting your own topic with the company if possible. You can contact the interviewers or potential managers via LinkedIn or HR people via email/Linkedin. Meanwhile, keep looking for more opportunities.

*Try to take your chances with option one before going to option two.*

**Possible case scenarios:**

\- you accept their current offer --> probably unsatisfied

\- you suggest sm topic --> they like it ---> you join them --> satisfied

\- you suggest sm topic --> they refuse --> you join them --> probably unsatisfied

\-You decline their offer. --> Join a local company. --> Uncertain.

the outcomes are based on your post; you might like the research thingy, who knows xdd

Good luck and keep us posteddd!

And people here have strong opinions that they can actually back up unlike the majority of tunisians(I'm not discounting educated ones,I've had people tell me some stuff is haram because it's against the social norm even though imams would beg to differ)


So how do you do research(subreddits/websites/Forums/neutral youtube video essays etc)?","YouTube, X, Google 1 page, Yandex 1 page, Google Scholar, Reddit, My imaginary friends..

https://preview.redd.it/qesik4vhnx3c1.jpeg?width=990&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f1948b601e36392227d49f2094ab686148abbe06","whatr are you searching for

searching for thing is one of my hobies","When you search for Islamic topics then I would suggest finding few imams that you like to listen to. Then it becomes easier to seek more knowledge about an Islamic topic when you already like the imam or a few imams. Beware of sources. Double check them and see if they are legit. Some imams throw around with sources and sometimes you find that the source they quoted, is either not that applicable to what they said, cause the context is a different one or the source is not as authentic.
Now Quranic verses are easy to fact check. With hadith and sunnah you gotta check if the source comes from an authentic background. There is a list with authentic books for hadith and sunnah.

With researching random topics it depends how well you wanna know them. When you write an academic paper then you need scientific term papers. They have to quote everything they claim with a legitimate source to back it up. Specialist literature is also very important for that. You find tons of informations and sources on the specific topic. You can find those in libraries (or digital libraries) and or on Google scholar.
You can also watch a documentary on any streaming platform or on YouTube, same with educational videos when you wanna ease into the topic first. They also provide you usually with sources to fall into a rabbit hole of more informations.

You can even start with Wikipedia. Read a little bit into it but focus on the sources.","it really depends on what you want to research, butthere are some general rules.

the first, and probably the most important rule : **NEVER BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU SEE ON THE INTERNET.**

the vast majority of content on the internet is propaganda and false news. this is something you need to drill into your head. if someone makes a claim, don't believe it unless they have a source, and then check that source as well, and what source it is using. there were many times when someone on reddit made a claim with a link to a news article or blog post, which turned out to have a clickbait title making it look like they agree with the point said redditor was making, only to say the opposite in the actual body of the article.  
there were also many cases where someone post a reference, that i then found out to be fake when i tried checking their validity.

for instance, and this is something a lot of facebook pages in particular like to do, but they make some claim or try to present some neat information and they put the infamous ""studies have revealed"". if you found something like this and no links to said ""studies"", then it's safe to assume it's a lie.

when it comes to proper sources, Wikipidea **IS NOT A VALID SOURCE BY DEFAULT.** the good thing is that they reference their sources in the bottom of the page, in the section named ""references"". you can check all the sources there to make sure what you are reading is legit.

for things that have a scientific nature, you use specifically Google Scholar, not the regular google search engine. the regular search engine will mostly take you to blogs and news papers, 80% of which are full with mis-information.   
Google scholar is a bit harder to use, since it only shows published research papers (you need to pay to access a lot of them, but there are some websites that allow you to crack them), and reading research papers is not exactly as entertaining, and takes a lot of brain power, but it's better to get a proper idea once you get used to it.

oh and, you can't trust all research papers either. they have to be peer reviewed. and for those with a medical nature, you need to have a good understanding of advanced concepts in probability and statistics, that way you can double-check the data and they way they handled it. if you choose something science related for university, you will learn a lot about those staistics and probability (the subject most people fail in uni)  
case in point, the research paper that started the whole ""vaccins cause autism"" rumor was not peer reviewed, clearly stated in the discussion that there was no clear correlation between vaccines and autism, and within 5 minutes of reading it, i found some really bad methodology and statistical mistakes, and i'm no scientist. simply from doing a single research project (analysis of the nutrition of kids with iron deficiency anemia in bousalem), i learned how to spot such mistakes.

last thing is something i suggested to another tunisian redditor today, and that is to learn about **Bias in research**, for instance cognitive bias, since by understanding how bias works, you can learn how to see things in a more objective manner. you should also learn about the **dunning-kruger effect (**a type of cognitive bias that makes people with no knowledge over-estimate what they actually know**)**, keeping this in mind is usually a good reminder that we humans really know nothing in the grand scheme of things, and should always take things slow and learn more before making a conclusion",I am 18 bac snee zeda.  Ive been through this but I had this crisis much earlier tho lol.  I had this at 13. Is God real ? Is it true that there is a creator ? What if all of this was bulshit ? Or maybe there is a god but its not the god an worshiping in Islam maybe its the god of Christianity or even Hinduism lmao naybe god is in the form of a cow ! . Everything is possible. So I started to search for the values of each religion waht do they believe in exactly what are they rules and values. And what are the evidence they use to prove and back up their religion with too ! I read all of them including Islam and including atheism what are the evidence that prove there is no god and we're just here .... . After reading them all i found that the possibility of existence of god is more convincing than the one of monkeys or the one of mitochondia . But which god now ? Alright I believe that there is a higher power but which god?   Which one is the true god ? I kept learning about all the main religions and then realised that only  Judaism and Islam convinced me . They are logical . And have evidences scientifical ones . There is so much science facts in quran how in hell did a book from 1400 years ago have these amounts of facts . That came from a person that can't read or write his name in his mother language . He was illiterate and that's a historical facts . How ? Only one person can know this much when science wasn't this advanced only one person the person who knows that because they simply created all of this . So now it's between Judaism and Islam even tho my family is Muslim and I am born as Muslim too . Which one ? They're both logical but how can Judaism be the only true religion when the Holy book of Islam knows this much of secrets . Well it can be because Islam is the continuity of Judaism.  I found science I believed in science . And science convinced of Islam.  That's why am now Muslim . The scientific evidences in quran are on another level .,2023-12-02 19:03:28

&#x200B;

Tunisia is ranked 9th in Africa, Algeria scored only slightly ahead of us while Egypt seems to be having a great time with its tech industry, even if we take it by population size, Egypt is ahead of us!

With its 15% unemployment rate, and political and economic instability, what would Tunisians do if they had better opportunities? Imagine the future ahead of us if we had good policies regarding our economy. Tunisia holds the chance to be the tech hub of Africa and the Mediterranean, but the question remains: why the fuck are we in this miserable situation?","This is as good as it seems to you. The stat that you are bringing here is showcasing no more than the fact that:

Tunisia is the 2nd country worldwide producing enginners to the total population. Investors and Multinational Corporations (espacially French) are exploiting that factor in addition to the low salaries compared to the expertise cost, espacially in IT.

A better statistics that I would be happy to see is the Number of Funds and Investments for Tunisian Startup and Companies which directly contribute to the arise of our country's GDP.","This is not a win, Vc's allocate budget per countries to spend, and in Tunisia they barely find projects to invest in","As someone form the western part of Africa, be thankful this waay better","No matter how you slice it, MENA region (including Tunisia) is in a very bad situation with a funding shortage hitting the tens of billions of dollars mark for the next decade. The money that did come in recent years mostly went to copycat startups mimicking the successes of services providers like Careem or Fintech (e-wallets, savings, investment). Worth noting is that even in politically and financially stable countries like the Gulf nations, funding is still low percentage-wise compared developed nations with startup hubs. Truth is only a handful of startups in the region make it to IPO status, and few as well manage to get acquired. 

Tunisia's got its own set of issues. Sure, political stability would be nice, but it won't magically bring in billions for tech funding. That's just wishful thinking. VC money wants teams that are tech solid, experienced in business, and that their model manages to create those sweet large revenue streams before they commit a single dollar in funding. Risk taking venture investors in MENA are mythical creatures, they don't exist. Couple that with Tunisia's limited market, and securing funding will always be a nightmare to go through. 

But here's the silver lining, there's a stash of cash in the MENA region. Tunisia needs a total makeover for its business education, like, a national emergency level investment. Because Tunisia just as every place in MENA lacks founders who know their stuff, can scale up, and come up with a profitable business model that actually works. It's not just about having a great idea; you gotta know how to turn it into a money-making machine. Tunisia also needs to spend a lot on deep tech R&D. Invest big in uni research labs. Lastly, when it comes to digital services and publishing, Tunisia's got a great advantage, the MENA region itself. We're talking a massive shared media market with a common language. The whole region's starving for fresh alternative cultural digital spaces: blogs, websites, services, you name it. Those digital spaces can also improve Tunisia's image as a rising tech hub enabling it to attract funding for the other tech areas. 

Picture this: an investor looking at a local outlet with a few hundred thousand users versus one aiming for the regional market with tens of millions of users across the MENA region. Who do you think they will fund or seek to acquire?",2023-12-02 16:39:18

Thank you !","If you already struggled socially in Tunisia, don't come here unless you're a HUGE introvert or in love with the German culture. Finding a fucking wife here is easier than finding a cool friend (speaking from experience).

Food and weather really sucks here in my opinion, but many may not care about that.

If you're bac math, uni will not be extremely hard here. Science education in Tunisia deserves much more credit. Jobs after unis are fairly easy to find, work is chill too.

I wouldn't recommend it but I also don't care about all the modern opportunities such as cinemas, concerts or modern present here. I pretty much just care about work, nature, food and social life, 3 of those are much better in Tunisia. Germany is just very very boring, you wouldn't believe what people here unironically discuss, it's so fucking boring like holy shit...","Listen, studying in Germany is a very unique experience. For it to be worthwhile you need to put in the effort for mingling into groups and societies. Understand how the whole system works and keep in mind to enjoy the whole process. Studying at university in general should be a memorable experience and as much as studying is important building your future correctly in a well community is also important.

I can help you understand everything you want about studying in Germany in all detail. Let me know if you need further help!","Generally yes, I would recommend it.

I'm 27F and I know it's embarrassing but I've never been to a nightclub/bar or had a drink with friends before. I'm an introvert and almost always studying/working and I do love my job and the career I've built for myself but I feel like I've wasted most of my 20s already and I don't want to be boring anymore. Any advice on where to go? How to act? What to expect? I know reinventing myself takes more than going to a bar and having fun in public but I want this to be a start. (Please don't be mean and thanks)","There's nothing even remotely embarrassing about this, you don't have to live with anyone's standards","I'll try to give you the same advices i gave to my little sister when she wanted to go to a bar with her friends: 

Start by planning based on your music taste. 

Try to go to an event in a barwhere a genre you like is played (that pay a fee at the door filters A LOT!)

When you go there just stick to your friend or crew and have fun with them, dance, discuss, drink or try new drinks whatever 

Don't feel ashamed or shy when you're drinking, remember that's why people go there, to drink.

Avoid taking drugs!

Avoid liquors for the first time, stick with beer or wine with food

Drink water 

Avoid talking to much older guys, people who are flexing wealth in a space supposed to celebrate music

If a stranger touches you when he's trying to tell you something WALK AWAY.

If a stranger smiles at you from a distance and kept with doing their shit without approaching you for more than an hour, they're most likely decent and you can make your move if you like them back.

Avoid dancing with strangers (many people will disagree with me but better safe than sorry) 

Drink water

Have fun chebeb!","Its not being boring or being out of touch when you dont go to bars. Its called being a normal person and making wise decisions, yeah you might have some fun there but the drawbacks far outweigh the benefits","There's nothing embarrassing about not having been to a nightclub before. People are different and everyone takes their own path and life choices. Grab a friend, hit up a chill bar, check the vibes and maybe explore a few places until you discover the atmosphere that resonates with you.","Hey there 

While this story is quite relatable There are 2 common myths in it

""I wasted my 20s"" 
Most people think they wasted their 20s, it's a matter of perception and comparing. 
Nothing is really wasted, 

""I am boring"" 
Everyone has a unique story and have little idea how much people would be interested to hear about it. 


I grew up identifying as introvert, anti social and boring,
I had tons of anxiety, a lot of self consciousness and self esteem issues. 
Somehow now i am very proud of those ""lost years"" and that ""boring nature""

That's strange, because i didn't appreciate them before, in fact i didn't appreciate myself before either. 


Now I don't know you or your situation, but i can tell you, i put a challenge to myself to meet a 100 people to go out to these uncomfortable places... 

I think talking to other people about these subjects made me realize:

1) feelings that life is wasted and feeling boring are .... feelings,  feelings are powerful but they are not truthful to the whole story,  they are truthful to the eye of the observer. 
just like wearing dark glasses and seeing everything in dark does not mean it is 

2) most people experience those feelings, even the ones who we see as did it correctly or look interesting

3) talking to people about these currently ""embarrassing"" topics is one of the most liberating things one can do,

4) even more liberation is in self compassion, and self acceptance, you do not need to be more ""interesting"" to accept yourself, it's kind of the other way around

5) whatever embarrassing or uncomfortable activity you take, you are going to be oke,",2023-12-01 22:56:23

Short story long , we used to have 6 cats one of them died like 3 months ago ""we didn't know why back then "", another one died last Sunday after as my neighbour said bl 7arf "" l9ineh msaker 3lih fl garage W kchekchou tal3a , jarebna ncharbou l 7lib ama met "" like you expect me to believe that my cat was locked in your damn garage for almost 3/4 days without you being aware of it ?? Bitch you expect me to believe that ?? Mlou , that used to be his name , got stuck once in our garage and he kept meowing and making noise till we got him out and he was locked for less than an hour thankfully..  you expect me to believe he stayed at your garage with no food , no water for 3 days till he died ???  Ok let's say am dumb enough to believe this .. his brother tou2 who was perfectly fine died at their house yesterday .. the same neighbour, and now their other brother is nowhere to be seen .. Is this a coincidence?? Am I being paranoid ??  I don't know ..and that's making me mad .
One more thing the same neighbour said that their daughter got rash which is possibly because of the cats but that's weird .. I mean honestly it's true mlou , tou1 and tou2 are our cats but they don't like being touched they only allow mom to do so .. you want me to believe that they didn't allow me to touch them yet they allowed your daughter to do so ????  
Well .. this might be true if they went to your house ..or lived there except they didn't.. why would they go  to the house of the people who beat them up and chase them with brooms ?? They're animals but they're not dumb enough to leave the house they were born in , being fed in and go to your house to suffer . 

Honestly I don't want to accuse them of doing such a thing as I don't know for sure ( if we forget about my 2 older cats who died two years ago .. after suffering from diarrhoea and abdominal pain which unfortunately I didn't pay too much attention to at that time as I thought it was from milk and diaries ) what really happened or whether they told the truth or lied to us but ..  I can't help but think this is somehow my fault .. what if he was hungry and went there for food as I neglected him ?? What if he was showing signs of being poisoned and I was too ignorant to notice .. 



I'm planning on deleting their videos and photos .. I can't stand looking at them .. I'm feeling sorry for them and for mom who's still crying their tragic death. ...

- I was disorganized and made very bad study schedules
- I was not relying on the most efficient resources
I don't know why I didn't ask some elite students and professors to help me make good plannings , I was just relying on TakiAcademy and I was all like ""I just have to try even harder and study 10 hours a day"" but that was not realistic and videos waste so much time and don't help you to memorize.
I even tried to read books but that's a sea that I should not dive into.

I am sure that they will give me a 0 even though some answers are still visible.

Please anyone help me 🙏😭"," was really smiling at this. ...

It's not about fixing yourself; it's more about organizing yourself and satisfying a ratio of 'how much you must understand / knowledge base,' considering the significant fact that 'learning = doing your failures.

If it worked for them it doesn't necessarily mean it will work for you. Every one is different and you should just find what works best for you.  

My advice is never rely completely on something like takiacademy (walla etude privé) . I recommend prioritising independent study( cour 9odemk w t7awel tefhem le max wa7dk w te5dem wa7dk) and using takiacademy as a supplementary resource. Also you should NEVER quit in the middle of an exam. You should get used to things going wrong and learn to keep yourself calm to deal with it and to make the best out of it.

Good luck with your exams","IT seems you are questioning the big picture of your studies at the worng time, If i am right let me tell you that i was there and probably everyone else who goes throught the education system without knowing exactly why.

I believe that wouldn't work for you as you seem to want to know the mathematicians and how their findings and additions do add some thigns to the world.

I find the LP1 very boring because there is little to no surprises. Sometimes the title is already won weeks before the final games. I live in Canada now and I started watching a bit of MLS and I think the competition is more interesting due to its format.

In Tunisia you have a “Big 4” that rarely changes and a standard classic competition that runs through the year with teams accumulating points, then moving on to the play off they do the same thing only with half the teams left.

I think that should change and a more North America style of competition would make the league a little bit more interesting and the games way more intense.

So we’d go with a regular season with each team playing every other team of the league twice (1 game away and 1 game at home)

Then the top half would qualify to the play offs. The last 2 are relegated and the rest see their season end.

For the play off, rather than just going with another point system why not going with direct elimination (see MLS or NBA playoff system)

So let’s say at the end of the regular season, your table would look like this 

1st 🇦🇸
2nd 🇧🇷
3rd 🇧🇮
4th 🇧🇪
5th 🇦🇽
6th 🇮🇨
7th 🇧🇼
8th 🇧🇹
9th 🇦🇫
10th 🇦🇬
11th 🇦🇺
12th 🇩🇲

So as we can see here, 🇩🇲 & 🇦🇺 would be relegated to LP2

1st until 6th would qualify to the play offs.

Play offs would consist of Quarter Final (Round 1), Semis (Round 2) and Final.

1st and 2nd would directly qualify to Round 2

For Round 1 you’d have 3rd 🇧🇮 playing against 6th 🇮🇨 and 4th 🇧🇪 playing against 5th 🇦🇽

All games of Round 1 would be a home and away game with aggregated points.

Round 2 you’d have 1st playing against the winner of 🇧🇮v🇮🇨 and 2nd playing against the winner of 🇧🇪v🇦🇽

All games of Round 2 would be a home and away game with aggregated points.

Finally you’d have the final that would be 1 game in a predetermined city and stadium that changes every year. It would increase the internal tourism and pressure officials to develop better infrastructure.

75 of colonialism, this is more than the amount of time we’ve been independent.

Reality is that colonialism was caused by Tunisians who mismanaged the big loans we got from Europe from monarchs to Ben Ayed. The colonial administration treated us no worse than how the king administration treated famine and the revolution of Ben Ghethaham. You can technically say that today we also live under a hybrid colonialism ruled by incompetent politicians whose last worries is our well beings and our economic freedoms. 

France should admit obviously to its crimes against our ancestors but that won’t be the key for our development.","Some people here gotta be really dumb to think that we are a poor country because we are having ""corruption"" issues and not being under major affect that still remains from the days of the colonialism. people here gotta touch grass and realize that corruption isn't much of an issue as much as colonialism and the oligarchic society we live in .

Based on the words used in the post you're lucky you didn't get a harsher treatment. Just cause it's satire doesn't mean you get to throw around hate speech (insults etc) towards a specific ideology or group.

As for the post that didn't get deleted: Post recieved zero reports, mods can't realistically view every post word by word.

My questions are: 

1) Am I going to be able to use my Fusha in Tunisia? Will tunisians laught at me for using it? 

2) Is Fusha spoken in Tunisia? What level of Fusha shall I expect in daily situations such as asking for directions, a taxi or an hotel?

For example about the Hamas hostages, Arabs in general and Tunisians in particular will show you only a good picture of how the kidnappers treated the detainees and how the detainees were so thankful to the kidnappers and some even fell in love with their kidnappers according to these people. 

In this they use the photo of a girl who was so chocked and traumatised but at the same time happy she finally is released and was smiling and try to make you believe that that girl was so happy with the treatment she got of the Hamas fighters that she had wished she stayed more. 

In all this, it doesn't matter of course whether the information itself is true or not but as long as it suits their narrative then they have no problem believing it is true.","I would like to apologize for not modding this on time, but I kinda assumed the community is better than this shit show in the comments.

I am considering moving to Tunisia for it’s looks ideal for my situation at the moment I was just wondering what house prices are like here.

Would a budget of 120000-160000 dinar get me anything and if so what roughly would it get like area bedroom bad/ good condition
Could I get a run down place that’s bigger that I could fix u with this price

And for buying a house I am Algerian so I can buy anything 200000 I’m pretty sure correct me if I’m wrong but I can get a Tunisian passport which I’m trying to do. 



The areas I’m interested in are sousse mahdia (because I have family in those areas) and Tunis, or ares near the border of Algeria  are these good areas and would you recommend 

I was interested in the southern city’s like djerba Sfax gabes since I was told there a bit more conservative like Algeria compared to the rest of Tunisia is this true

Any apps that help see prices of houses in Tunis I’ve been using mubawab if that’s reliable 

I know I asked allot any help would be Appreciated 

بارك لله فيك","In Tabarka they’re building apartments for Algerians for around that price for 1 bedrooms apartments. 

Check it out, [facebook page](https://m.facebook.com/AQUARESORTTABARKA)

Algerians usually prefer Tunis. Downtown apartments aren’t expensive but require lots of renovations. Otherwise, check in Ariana or banlieu sud. 

Sousse is expensive, for nice areas, but Monastir and Mahdia should be good for your budget. Have you figured out what will you be doing for work? Housing isn’t the issue but finding a reliable work is if you’re not in Tunis or/ and not Tunisian. You can live comfortably from investing in capital markets investment firms with annual returns of 10-20% if you have equal money to how much you’re putting on an apartment.","Bizerte is your solution. 2/3 hours max away from Algerian Border.

Today when i go back to Tunisia, i am considered a tourist, i cannot exceed living there for more than 3 months without a residency card (which i started asking for as soon as i turned 18 btw, until i left at 27..)

That's for the Tunisian passeport, it's really really really really hard for you to get citizenship.

As for buying a house, my parents never bought because they couldn't (I think that only libyans are allowed to, due to the ties they had with the wife of a certain ex president)","Idk about Dousse/Mahdia, but be ready to cough up a minimum of 150k for something decent in downtown Tunis. You can try your luck in Jendouba if you want to be close to the Tunisian border, but the quality of houses there is far from guaranteed, and you will have to find a friend who's in real estate to help you out without fucking you over.",2023-11-29 15:00:14
