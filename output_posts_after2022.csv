18wuybm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/18wuybm/the_most_unluckiest_thief_in_the_history_of/,9,The most unluckiest thief in the history of Tunisia,"I was gonna call him the stupidest, but this guy was not stupid by any means, he was as close to a real-life ninja as I've ever witnessed. But he didn't know, at the time, that his luck had long run out and he was running on empty.

It was a peaceful spring night in a peaceful city, and a taxi driver noticed someone working on a car in front of a mechanic's shop. The driver happens to know the owner so he called him up, asking if he had someone working this late and it didn't take long for everybody to recognize that a car was being stolen.

The driver, along with his passenger, a young man, dared to chase the thief who took off running until he reached our neighborhood.

We live in an apartment complex that is 5 stories high, the thief ran to the other one which is identical to ours. He went to the back side to hide, then climbed a window steel frame and onto the second balcony.

Upon hearing footsteps, the mom living there got out of her bedroom to check, she came face to face with the thief and chased him out bravely. A fierce mother you may think, but it's more than that, let me assure you. Her husband woke only a few seconds later but the thief was already gone.

By then, the building was already surrounded by policemen, it only took 2 minutes!

The thief went upstairs and onto the roof of the building. Then, and here comes the ninja part, he climbed down by grabbing the pipes to the side of the building and into a bathroom window. It was because he knew that by staying on the roof, he would just get himself cornered.

The father living there heard him and chased him out of that window. Everybody was aware by then so everyone kept checking their apartment. The ninja guy had no problem climbing down another two stories by grabbing said pipes, but he got exposed just as fast. 

It was at that moment, that he decided that his best chance was to jump to the compound next to the building and then make a run for it. The compound had a relatively high fence so the cops won't be able to chase him right away as he jumped, and that's what he did.

He jumped from a height of three stories, that's around 10 meters. And as you might've guessed, he broke something. The cops found him hiding under some stairs. He couldn't run at all.

The cops immediately transferred him to the capital for investigation as he seemed to have received some kind of training. 

Back to the mom who chased him out, she is, in fact, a trained cop. Her husband too. The father who found the thief in the bathroom? Yes, he's a cop too. Same for the residents of the other apartment in the third story. In short, all the residents were cops. And this thief thought he could just hide there.

You know the compound we talked about earlier? That's the main police station in the city. He jumped into the parking lot and then hid under some stairs. Maybe he noticed that there were a little too many police cars in the parking lot by then.

It was just a short walk to the investigation room. 

And that's how the most unluckiest thief in the history of Tunisia got caught and I don't think I will ever witness as much heavy-duty bad karma in one single night.

18wolw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/18wolw7/arabic_to_english_poem_translation_issue/,4,Arabic to English poem translation issue,"  

I've been dating a Tunisian man, who is claiming to have written the below poem for me:

عيناك نجوم ساحرة وهادية .. ضحكتك آسرة وعاتية .. ونبرة صوتك كأنها سياط قاسية .. وحنيني اليك كأنه امواج عنيفة وضارية .. مثالية انتِ وكأنك من الألماس مصنوعة .. وعلى تراب الجنة موضوعة .. وبالإستبرق والسندس ملفوفة ومرفوعة .. حقا مثالية .. بعيونك العسلية .. التي عندما انظر اليك تلقيان علي التحية .. عيون ليس كمثلها عيون .. صوّرها فأحسن تصويرها الله الحي القيوم .. فلا شيئ مثل صنعه سبحانه يخلق ما يشاء وانت عندي ابهى من القمر والنجوم .. تربعتِ على عرش قلبي ببساطتك .. وفرشتي في قلبي بساطك .. واكلتِ وشربتِ ونمتِ وكأنه بلاطك .. ولأبد الدهر سيبقى قلبي ارض ميعادك

As I don't know Arabic I have used Google translate and called him out on بعيونك العسلية because Google translates is to 'your hazel eyes' - I have blue eyes 🙃 I have freaked out a little, thinking that he wrote it for someone else/copied it for somewhere and forgot to change the eye colour. However, his response was: ""unlike in English, in Arabic we can use words to describe things differently, so honey doesn't have to mean colour but can also be used to describe sweetness"" - can anyone confirm if this is true in this case? I have checked the word العسلية in an online dictionary and it comes up with results like sugar, honey, honeymoon and honey-like, however I'm not sure if I believe him lol. Any help will be greatly appreciated, thanks :)","It goes more with color than sweetness but he's still right about it, it can mean sweetness and he added the honey thing instead of anything else just for the rythm, maybe..","It can mean sweetness, especially in this poem because it's easier to use ""عيونك العسلية"" to make it rhyme with the other verses.",It could be just to make it rhyme,He's cheating on you,"Honestly, since your eyes are blue, one could have been more creative and mentioned the sea.

My mom estimated it to be around 500ish trees(land wise) between me and my aunt 
No trees are planned .
I want to be aware of this business at my age (20) because i don't really believe in ky parents that they can grow it as a business
They will pretty much collect olive ,turns it into oil,sell it, keep the money until death.
My question is , is it really profitable and can my family mak a fortune out of it and it is really a business  and how much time will it take (ik it takes time)",Its profitable depends... kade emarhom el chojrat ou l5adema ml family yani entoum cht5dmo wala tjibo chkoun ou tnsech li zitoun iji 3am saba ou 3am re9ed ou 3am er9ad i7eb barcha mè ou lahwa kn andk chkoun ml 3aila wala tarf chkoun yefhm fima esel.

I'd say after substructing el ma3sra w khedmet el jam3an you will keep approximately 2/3 as a profit.","Its  profitable depends on where u live, for example u will have to drive to the country side where ur land is each week to check (3la eser9a, famma elli yeteada bel 8lam mte3ou yekloulek echajrat,famma s8ar 3adi ykasrou 3wed bch yela3bou,etc.) So keep in mind gas money.

Moreover, 3andk el ektife2 edheti, since u gonna start such project u will have to keep a quantity for urself (olives or olive oil) cuz u will see tht the prices will always go up so u wont have to buy any more, u can just provide for urself and ur family (also depends on ur family members, and since i assume u dont have the ability to stop ur family from donating to ur uncles and aunts it might not be able to be as profitable as u expect)

Happy New Year to all!

I'm a 24-year-old man who spent the last 6 months living abroad after graduating. However, I've decided to take a different path in life. With my new 100% remote job, I'll be spending the next year in Tunisia.

Currently, I'm back living with my parents, but I constantly feel lonely and depressed. It's challenging to make real connections or meet people with similar interests here,  not having a car and living in a poor neighborhood have made it worse.

Can you recommend some chill places where I can engage in fun activities and meet people of the same age group ?","To meet people with same ""interest"" as you, you have to go to the places where they'll be interested in. Let me explain: if you're interested in meeting people who are into health and fitness join a gym/martial art club. If you're into nature you can join also a running or hiking or camping group(those are starting to be come popular on fb in Tunisia last few years)
If you're into computer science, attend coding competitions, hackathons and tech conferences.
Other than that make sure you go outside as much as possible go work in public coffees or public libraries as much as possible. The more time you spend outside the more likely to meet people. Strike up conversations with strangers whenever possible and adequate (you'll be surprised how many people will be responsive and welcoming that)
And know that making new connections is always a challenge at the beginning.","Mmmmm If you’re like some tourist all the country is open. I would recommend doing all of it. But if you had to choose Djerba or Tabarka would be my choices. 

Have fun


But a great Idea for a full year might be to go all around the coast that could be interesting. And all the major cities are there anyways",,,,2024-01-01 18:12:09

- using and abusing the working class in every possible way , from the lousy salaries to the hazards and risks they put their employees on ( nse elli tatla3 fil kmayen men teli for example)

Me (from Slovakia) and my fiancé (Tunisia) - together 2years will have wedding at February. First we will go only to baladyia (February) and in June we will have party with both families and friends :) Iam pretty excited! 🫶🏾 I have couple of questions (of course I asked my fiancé and my friends also in Tunisia) but I want to ask more people! 
First of all I love Tunisia (especially food is delicious 🌶️). 
• any tips what to do and what better not to do on party and in baladyia? 
• in Tunisia bride has a lot of makeup and red lips -  I’m not using a lot of makeup (I hate it 🥶)  and also red lipstick is not my favorite. 
• can I dance on party? Cause in Europe we are dancing all night together with family, friends. But in Tunisia I saw a lot of videos that bride and groom they are only siting. I want to enjoy every minute. 
• can I have witness (a woman) on baladyia? 
• it’s okay to put only little amount on my face? 
• what about dresses to baladyia? I want to rent or buy something like this: is it possible to rent/buy it near Monastir or Mahdia ? 🫶🏾(on photos is not me haha, Iam blond)  if you have contact or recommendations I will be so happy. Thank you to all and have a nice start to New year ❤️","Congratulations!
First of all, it’s your wedding so don’t do anything you’re unhappy with. My wife didn’t like the Geisha-makeup either so she had normal makeup and none of us liked the sitting part so we did that just for the photos and spent the evening partying with our guests. 

I believe most people choose something less heavy than the traditional wedding dresses for the townhall ceremony. What has been popular recently are suits inspired by traditional dresses. You’ll find quite a few businesses that specialize in that if you search in FB, IG, TikTok.

One last consideration: it is easier to get married in your (EU) country of residence and get the marriage registered in Tunisia than the other way around.","Hey OP congrats !! First, do not forget it is your wedding and especially as the bride you should do what's on your mind ! For the makeup part, tunisian girls tend to go to professional make-up artists, but a lot of them are not great, and that explains the ""heavy"" makeup. You can do your own makeup, or you can also book a more skilled makeup artist (I recommend ""feryel studio"" or ""lobna ben ammar"" if your wedding is in Tunis).
Of course you can dance and party all night long, the sitting part is really outdated and usually only done for photos and for resting between dances ! As for the witness in baladeya, it can be a woman without any problem.
I would add one advice regarding alcohol, some tunisian families consume it openly in weddings, some prefer to hide it, some forbid it completely, so you should discuss it with your fiance beforehand and inform your own family about that.",what's on your head,Mistake: I'm not using a lot of makeup (I hate it ) and also red lipstick is not my favorite it's okay to put only little amount on my face? 🤟🏾,,2024-01-01 12:44:26

Last summer we passed engineering school entrance exam and got accepted to the same university,and , you guest it, same class.
We started to talk sometimes and at that point i didn't have feelings for her, 2/3 months later , we started to be much closer, spent the lunch break together, go to the library almost everyday and study,
She is so charming and have a good personality and i really think we are compatibility,
The thing is, she is so flirty, she sometimes says things or act in a certain way like she is giving hints, idk if it is only with me or im just making this up as an excuse to make things work with her, she also wanted me to keep her relationship a secret because no one knows she has a BF(cz of a new uni)
I really like her but I don't want to confess or do anything, I know for a fact i ll be rejected and our friendship will be ruined, added to that things will be awkward as I can't avoid her(same classe), and she is also in a relationship and I don't want to be a douch
Talking about texting now, I really want to talk for hours and share things, but we almost talk about studying or if the conversation shif to another subject she almost left me on seen or never respond, when I do the same behavior and Tell her she do the same she denies it
The question is how can I keep a distance from her?
I tried a bit through muting the messenger notifications and responding late

(-) Terrible bureaucracy. Horrendous visa/residency policy. Lots and lots of stalling. Relatively restrained market opportunities compared to the rest of the EU. Also relatively stingier wages unless you're studying something that will pay a fixed rate regardless of country (accounting, finance, swe).

(+) beautiful country. Warm weather. Tolerable people.

\-- Go the agency route. They'll take care of everything. Spain is hardly known for its academics lmao.

\>Hungary

(+) Your most foolproof shot on account of the yearly scholarship. Lot's of Tunisians been there done that. Lot's of coverage (information). Lot's of testimonies. 

Beautiful country. Rich history. Abundant culture.

(-) Intelligible language. Central European shithole. Not in the Shenghen zone.

(+) Beautiful country. Great infrastructure. Great academics in NTNU etc. Possible scholarships.

(-) Another soulless Scandinavian antisocial rut. Bsc's are taught in Norwegian. Dubious visa allocation prospects.

French is our second language and it's the language you should be using to be understood MOST of the time, as few people outside the hotel will understand English much less form understandable sentences using it.

As for the hotel , french is preferable, and I know from my experience working summer jobs as a hotel waiter that most waiters know just enough English to greet you , serve you  joke around and maybe some chit chat.
TL:DR French","Depends on the place and age of the person you’re talking to, if you’re addressing staff at a hotel or people over 25 go for french. 

If you’re asking directions from a teenager or a young adult you might wanna use English, French might work too tho.

For   A year or so everyone was joyful and everyone felt proud to be Tunisian for once.
I remember  that performance impacted us so much that a-lot of my peers decided to pursue a handball career . Every child and teenager was dreaming about being a hanballer.

One of them   Was my childhood friend  who after ,wissem Hmam scored his famous 360 turn goal , told he will be  as good as him when he grows up, i have seen  from his facebook  posts that he is still playing the game  for a club in the second division , but it still made smile he followed his dream","Yeah, I still remember when we finished at 4th place at the 2005 world cup. Wissem Hmem, Heykel Mgannem, Issam Tej, Sahbi Ben Aziza & company gave us a world cup full of exciting and unforgettable memories. I was 14 years old back then. During that period, as a Tunisian living abroad, I remember going to school holding my held high and feeling so proud and exited because I came from a country with such strong national teams, both in football and handball, and I knew that all of my friends had witnessed their strength as well, and were going to talk to me about it. This was my oxygen and my cryptonite. These were the things I literally lived for. 

It began with our football team taking home the winning trophy of CAN 2004, followed by the outstanding performance of our handball team at the 2005 world cup, and then our football team qualifying for the 2006 world cup. Those really were the golden days for Tunisian sports and I have never felt nearly as proud to be a Tunisian from a sports perspective as I did back then.

\*How realistic is this idea? how hard is it to land a remote job in Tunisia if have some good English communication skills.

\*given our country that makes every thing hard, is it even legal, if it is what's the paper work required to do it

\*wouldn't foreign currency transfers from other countries rase some suspicions among the Tunisian banks?

\*does any one have experience in remote jobs and do they pay well if converted to Tunisian dinar?

any answer would be mush appreciated, feel free to burst my dream bubble if necessary :) thanks! <3","Every office jobs will be automated in the next 10 years, don't worry.",I think the hard part(if everything else goes well) would be the method of paying you.,"Data entry clerking might not be the most future-proof career choice. It's not meant to discourage you, but the reality is that the demand for this job is not very high, even in Western countries. The skills required for data entry are not advanced, making it susceptible to automation.

In fact, a significant portion of data entry tasks is already being taken over by AI, specifically through computer vision. This shift is happening rapidly and is expected to continue. Around 80% of such tasks are already automated, providing a more reliable and cost-effective solution.

I'm not saying this to offend you, but rather to encourage you to consider expanding your skillset and exploring other career options. It's a good idea to proactively look for opportunities that align with future trends and technological advancements. It's about ensuring your long-term career stability and growth.

The tradition of parading a doll around the village during drought is common among Berbers. Search [Anzar](https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A3%D9%86%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%B1) for more information on it, it exists among all sedentary Berbers all over the Maghreb.

The tradition on the other hand is absent in the Levant. Lebanese people don't have it, Syrians don't have it, Palestinians don't have it. The only group in the Middle East who have something that is vaguely similar are Kurds and that probably was an independent development.

That's not to mention that we have exactly 0 evidence Phoenicians and/or Cannanites practiced anything similar. Levantine rain making rituals evolved into what we today know as the Dabke, they are totally different from Omok Tangou/Anzar.

So tell me, in light of this evidence, what is more likely : That Omok Tangou is just an evolution of an already existing Berber tradition, or a remnant of a Punic tradition of whom no evidence for its existence ?",2023-12-31 12:29:31

Get a driver license. Rules are the same except that you can make a right turn on red lights. He would also need to rent a car the day of the driving test after he passes the written one ( y3addi el code ). All this happens at the DMV: Department of Motor Vehicles. They’ll give him a doc to be able to rent a car with of course.

18u3ens,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/18u3ens/cultural_differences_between_tunisia_compared_to/,12,Cultural differences between Tunisia compared to Morocco,"What are some cultural differences between Tunisia and Morocco? Both are touristic, North African, former- french colonies. While Algeria is likely a blend of the two, are there any notable differences between Tunisia and Morocco in terms of their dialect, food, culture etc. 

Many Thanks", What you call bread,"Dialect is very different, not to the point of being completely intelligible but quite so for an untrained ear. Tunisian has more romance words and pronunciation compared to moroccan also some base words have different etymology, meaning and not quite the same history and language mix before the French came.

Food is different. Moroccan food is more based on sweet-savory combination and spices such as cinnamon or rad el hanout which are not used at all in Tunisian cuisine. Tunisian cuisine is based on tomatoes, peppers, olive oil, thyme/tabil, harissa and fish/seafood for the most part giving it a ressemblance to Italian cuisine (especially Sicily).

Culture wise, Tunisian are more foul mouthed on average, Tunisia is not a monarchy and very anti monarchy while Moroccans are on average very supportive of monarchy. Moroccans are also on average more conservative than Tunisians on religious and nationalist aspects. Some other differences are berber language and nationalism, nigh inexistant in Tunisia while almost 50% of moroccan population belongs to an active berber tribe and its a big topic in morocco. Also Tunisia is in the middle if the Mediterranean while Morocco is on the Atlantic, and while Morocco would focus more on the middle ages (al andalus) in its national history, Tunisia would focus more on Antiquity (Carthage) where the notion of the Mediterranean world and the importance of the geographical location of Tunisia is more emphasized giving a different outlook on the modern world.","Tunisia is less religious and more Mediterranean in terms of the culture, food, and ambiance. 

The food is decently different, Tunisian food being tomato sauce + Harissa based, while Moroccan can have a less spicy+ sweet/savory tones. 

Morocco is also different due to having the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Tunisia has the Mediterranean as the main historical + cultural influence, plus proximity to Italy.

Requirement (Tunisia): 

* Tax Id (Batinda)
 * if you do it as a ""personne physique"" you won't pay taxes (at least it was like that the last time i checked)
 * (contant an accountant for more information, the whole thing will cost you 500~1k tnd depending on your city)

* Use that Tax Id to open a bank account
 * this is necessary so that when you receive the money and Central Bank goes ""ija 3aych weldi"" (they will do it through your bank not directly to you)

 * You then send the Apple receipts to your banker and the banker will unfreeze the money. 


&nbsp;

Requirement (Apple):

* https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/getting-paid/overview-of-receiving-payments/

Advice: 

* Don't over complicate it 
 * I knew a dozen of people who chickened out of ideas like this and/or freelancing because ""L'bled msakra sa7bi"", it is not. 


&nbsp;

* Don't deal personally with Tn administration
 * Get an an accountant! you have no idea how easy your life will be with them.



&nbsp;

* Don't be a cheap fuck
 * You have to spend money to make money, the initial 500~1k you need to get started legally is a must-pay and it should be negligeable compared to the amount your are planning to make. 

 * No one will ever know about your App if you don't pay for User Acquisitions (Ads), so you better start looking for a solution on how to do that too, 

 * the 1k of ""Carte technologique"" can be a first step, and with the ""batinda"" you can turn it into 10k. 

 * And if you're good and know what you're doing, your bank will give you more, but this is not an ""a3mel matleb"" situation, you need to have contacts and prove that you can make steady USD/Euro income with that bank

I actually left the country due to the horrible salaries.","Guys, can you specify what y’all doing for living? Because these expenses are HUGE lol.","I live with my girlfriend and we spend  3000-3500 broken as follows:

1.1k rent and  bills


600 groceries 

400 dates and going out

500 cars  and fuel ( we got two cars)

400 clothes

100 tnd for vape

18tg3kp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/18tg3kp/moving_to_tunis_as_a_tunisian_born_abroad/,18,Moving to Tunis as a Tunisian born abroad,"Hey y’all! Ever since I started a remote job I’ve been considering temporarily relocating to tunis for a  few months to perhaps a year.

For context, I’m 22 (F) born in Canada. I’ve visited tunisia on multiple occasions, speak darija but it’s slightly broken (I understand it fluently tho). My main motivation really is that I want to experience life in Tunisia at least once in my life, improve my Arabic, and make Tunisian friends (I literally don’t have any 😭).

Although I have family in nabeul/siliana I’m thinking that it would be nice to live on my own in the capitol, tunis. I wouldn’t want to stay with my extended family because they live on remote farms and the wifi is awful 😭😭 also I’ve lived abroad in europe by myself, so this wouldn’t be a first for me. 

I just really don’t know how to go about finding a studio or a temporary rental especially when I’m in Canada at the moment. I also don’t know anything about tunis, the safe areas to live, or if moving to tunis is even realistic. I’ve never been to tunisia by myself and would never venture anywhere without my parents. I feel as though people might take advantage of the fact that I really don’t know much about how things work, especially considering that I’m a girl. 

I’m wondering what you guys think and if you have any tips with finding a good place to live considering im abroad !","A couple of things to consider :

1 * Trust no one until they prove they are trust worthy. Unfortunately, for too many people you are not a person, you are a green card who will put out. I'm soory for the vulgar image but it is what it is. Be very worry of others, especially young man your age.

2 * Any middle class neighbourhood can work for you. Before you sign a lease visit the place at night to figure out what is what. Some places I suggest : La marsa, Sidi Bousiid, Carthage, Jardin Carthage, Manzah ( 1, 5, 6, 7,8 or 9), Jardin Manzah, El manar, Nasr (Ariana)...
You are looking at anything from 600 to 1000 tnd per month (200 to 300 usd).

3* No matter where you live, a car is essentiel. Cars are super expensive (high import taxes). A brand new ""toy"" starts at around 40 to 50k tnd (15ish k usd). You can get away with taking cabs or ""bolt"" (our version of uber). It will cost around 1 tnd (0.3 usd) per km for regular cabs and around 1.5 tnd (0.5 usd) per km for ""bolt"".","Probably places like Marsa and Carthage will fit you,( if this is the first time you live in tounes) you'll love it there. Marhbe bik:)","I lived my entire life in Tunisia, and now after living abroad for 10 years, I feel that it's very difficult for me to adapt back to the culture over there (even though I really love Tunisia and I'm planning to go back) so I really applaud your audacity for taking such an adventure.

1.As mentioned before, trust no one (people are sick with wanting to flee the country so they'll do anything to get a visa through you)
2. Don't go out at night especially in places you don't know. Safety is a concern.
3. Always hide your valuables like phone and wallet.
4. Forget about something called personal space. That doesn't exist in Tunisia.
5. Be ready to fight for your rights wherever you go.

Despite all of those things I still believe Tunisia is a beautiful country and offers a great experience for anyone who travels there. It's just that it's a 3rd world country and it has been through dire financial issues which makes everyone living under stress in the country.

Concerning the location, I lived my whole life in Sousse/Kantaoui area. I definitely prefer it over Tunis the Capital since it's less crowded and more manageable for someone who's new, and yet it's very beautiful area with multiple attractions.

As far as renting goes, you could look for posts on websites like Tayara.tn and then you could contact people via Whatsapp on their phone numbers.

else chance = 0%","Since I work (not full-time) in a very similar field (data visualization) and I do game dev in my free time (mainly WebGL; stuff that runs on your web browser) I can share some thoughts.

Game development is a huge field and I don't know what you want exactly: Programming (then which? Gameplay, sound, graphics, etc...), design and art (also what? 3D modelling, sounds, animations, etc...). I can only give some questionable advice about the programming side.

Let's assume you want to be a game dev programmer, then basic CS modules with a particular focus on graphics is needed. I studied at ENSI and I still find online books absolutely top notch at teaching me anything in CS.

A good thing about game dev, if you manage to become a good game dev programmer then tons of other opportunities open up for you. Why I say this? Well game dev opportunities are relatively scarce (if compared to Web dev for instance) and you may very well find it extremely difficult to enter the field. Therefore keeping other options open is the best.

People mention individual Steam success as of they are the norm. No. Publishing a successful game is extremely difficult. A good advice is to not rely on that and work with big studios instead.

Concerning the degree, I don't think it matters that much. Yes a degree in CS is important but at the end they will judge you based on your projects and experience.

Feel free to dm me if you need more, very questionable, advices about game dev :)","I have been in the game industry for over 6 years now , I had to learn computer graphics from scratch ( opengl , directx11 ) , eventually I moved to unreal engine to become Lead technical artist at a big UK game studio.

So my question is that kissing through lips haram before and after marriage?",r/copypasta has been real quiet since this dropped,Depends if the guy’s wearing lipstick,We even do French kissing in here (kissing with lips +tongue 😝)   when i see people kissing and loving each other i feel hopeful for the future  but on the other side of the matter cursing in public and littering is way worst than kissing you should be shocked when you see a someone spitting in the ground or throwing a water bottle in the street.,"Tunisian modern couples kiss. 
Before or after marriage we don't give a damn anymore cause love is love.
A lot of tunisian people aren't that religious, most of us drink and fu** mostly men but a lot of girls do too.
You'll also find real muslim people, atheist, Christian, Jewish... And no one gives a damn about what the others do

- Paypal is going to cause way more problems than solve any",[deleted],"Regarding iPhone and Androids, i own and use both and this is my observation. 
For regular use an iPhone performs better, animations are smooth, app switching is fast, the ui is responsive, battery life is great, the software is optimized to run on the hardware even though on paper they look underpowered. 
Androids is a generic os and highly customizable and is open for customization (to a certain extent) it’s great for tinkering compared to ios which is completely locked down. The os is meant to run on a plethora of hardware combinations, this can cause all kind of issues especially on underpowered systems, it’s the manufacturers responsibility to make sure the system works well. Let’s stick to the big names like Samsung… from my experience i find that the system degrade with time, something that an iPhone won’t experience as much, Android will inevitably become slow and laggy, also manufacturers are now developing their own « skin », some are better than other, some are worse than stock Android, it’s highly fragmented, if you decide to change the Android phone brand for your grandpa he will be lost and have to re-learn some stuff, iPhones are more consistant.

If you only care about the apps (Youtube, social media crap) iPhones are just better and optimized for that.
If you value customization, go with Android (avoid the cheap garbage)

Regarding the overpriced argument, i would say it’s partially true but it’s due to inflation. I would say the same thing for someone owning a flagship Samsung, it’s not cheap. Android is open for more competition, that forces the price to go down. There’s only Apple making iPhones, they can increase the price however they want as long as people keep buying them.
And for the status of wealth argument, that’s a bi product of their cost and rarity among the Tunisian population. That’s not the case in other developed countries. It’s not that hard or prestigious to own an iPhone.

Biometric Identification Card: Mandatory from Age 15, Occupation Removed from Data

December 27, 2023, 07:45

Hala Jaballah, Chairwoman of the Committee for Rights and Freedoms, discussed the work session held last Monday regarding a draft law to amend and complete the legislation related to the national identification card.

She revealed that according to the proposed law, the current card will be replaced with a biometric one, which will be mandatory from the age of 15. It can also be obtained at the age of 12 with parental authorization when necessary.

She clarified that the information on the card will be continuously updated, and the card itself will not have a specific expiration date, unlike the old card.

Furthermore,Bord Deputy Hala Jaballah explained that the biometric card will contain an electronic chip that stores essential data such as name, surname, father's name, mother's name, date of birth, gender, along with a photograph and a thumbprint. Optional information, such as organ donation and blood type, can also be included.

She announced that the draft law stipulates the removal of the occupation from the identification card, and there is an agreement within the committee to eliminate this data to establish social justice among all citizens.

*She also emphasized that the sessions and hearings regarding the draft law for the national identification card are still ongoing, involving all parties, including authorities and ministries.*",,,,,,2023-12-27 07:47:22

To make it even better, try looking into related areas. For example, check out IT guidance for companies. You'll get to review things like software licenses and contracts, which is pretty cool and adds a tech twist to your legal skills.

Another good move is exploring the connection between law and health finance. This means you'd be dealing with legal stuff in the healthcare money world. It's interesting and gives you a different perspective on how laws work in different fields.

So, by mixing it up like this, you not only show you can adapt but also learn about law in various settings. It'll make your internship more exciting and give you a solid foundation for your future legal adventures. Keep up the good thinking!",,,,2023-12-26 16:19:47

- how safe is it for women to solo travel?
- do you recommend an air bnb as theyre cheaper? if so, in what areas are they safest?
- do you guys use any taxi apps like Uber, Bolt, Yandex, etc. 
- is english common there?
- any general recommendations or tips that i wouldnt be able to get by googling?
- any food delivery services like ubereats, boltfood, etc?

thank you! 🤍","- It's relatively safe, depending on the neighborhood, just avoid walking alone at night in empty neighborhoods or downtown.
- I think the safest places to rent an Airbnb would be La Marsa, Sidi Bousaid, Carthage.. (If you're staying in Tunis)
- We use Bolt and a couple of other apps, but only in the capital areas. Normal taxis are cheaper though. 
- Not as common, if you need to ask for directions or something, try asking someone who looks young (like in their twenties/teenagers).
- Be aware of scammers, if you get asked to hold something ( that could go from flowers to an actual animal), or to take a picture,  refuse to. They would charge you for money for it. Avoid using your phone in the street so it won't get stolen and hold your bag close to you.

- many people are looking for employment, ideally government employment, not for work. Otherwise the country would not need to - quite absurdly - import workers while suffering from unemployment 


- a partial root cause of that was the inflation of diplomas as ZABA built a system to keep people busy at school/university and off the streets.

## La Tunisie est l’un des principaux points de transit pour les migrants clandestins locaux et originaires d’Afrique subsaharienne vers l’Europe. Entre janvier et septembre 2023, plus de 14 000 migrants tunisiens ont atteint les côtes européennes clandestinement, selon les données nationales.

La Tunisie et l’Italie ont signé, le 20 octobre dernier, un accord permettant la création de nouvelles voies de migration régulière entre les deux pays, à l’issue d’une rencontre de travail entre le ministre tunisien des Affaires étrangères, Nabil Ammar (photo, à droite), et son homologue italien Antonio Tajani (photo, à gauche), à Tunis.

Selon le communiqué du ministère tunisien, cet accord vise à offrir chaque année, à 4 000 travailleurs tunisiens qualifiés, l’opportunité d’aller travailler en Italie sur une période de trois ans.

Cette initiative s’inscrit dans le cadre d’une approche globale des deux pays à « promouvoir la migration légale, à lutter contre la migration irrégulière et la traite des êtres humains tout en permettant aux jeunes Tunisiens d’accéder aux opportunités d’emploi en Italie », indique la note d’information.

Il y a quelques semaines, ce pays d’Afrique du Nord, l’un des principaux points de transit pour des migrants clandestins locaux et originaires d’Afrique subsaharienne vers l’Europe, avait refusé l’aide financière de l’Union européenne dans le cadre d’un accord migratoire. 

Selon l’exécutif tunisien, cette aide allait à l’encontre de l’accord signé et de « l’esprit » qui a régné lors de la conférence de Rome sur la gestion des flux migratoires, tenue en juillet dernier. En effet, Tunis et Bruxelles avaient conclu un accord de près de 105 millions de dollars d’aide visant à lutter contre l’immigration irrégulière avec près de 42 millions dollars qui allaient être « alloués rapidement ».

Pour rappel, la Tunisie fait actuellement face à une situation socio-économique complexe marquée par des négociations avec le FMI, la flambée des prix et les désaccords avec l’Union générale tunisienne du travail (UGTT). Au premier trimestre 2023, le taux de chômage s’élevait à 16,1 % contre 15,2 % au dernier trimestre 2022, selon l’Institut national de la statistique.

Selon les données du Forum tunisien pour les droits économiques et sociaux (FTDES), depuis le début de l’année 2023, plus de 14 000 migrants tunisiens ont atteint les côtes européennes clandestinement.","Let’s goooooo. This is bad for both sides.

Aaslema ennes lkol, 

Inchallah lkolkom labes ! It is my first post on this sub. 

So title is self explanatory but I’ll give you more context. 

I am 25 years old (soon 26), I have been living for 7 years in Paris and let’s say that career wise I have been very lucky, since graduating. 

I am in the process of joining a US crypto unicorn as head of Business Development. The position is fully remote. My total compensation package is $215K annually. So around $18K/month. I have also done well in the crypto markets and have around $400K saved in the forms of various tokens. So I am relatively upper class even in western countries standards. 

I haven’t been to Tunisia for the past 5 years now, due to mainly work and never finding the right time. I take care of my family financially so always feel pressure.

But for the past year, I have been feeling less and less good here in France. Radical changes in society in terms of more racism, more insecurity, higher cost of living, taxes… I feel like despite everything I’ll always be just « an Arab » and a foreigner. 

And in the other hand I want to spend more times with my parents (They are turning 60 this year) and family and be in a place where I am welcomed and can for exemple go to the Mosque without people viewing it as weird. 

I have many questions : How does taxation work? Should I create an offshore company in Tunisia? How does FCR actually work?

How much would I need to live a « lavish » lifestyle in Tunis : Eat often at fancy restaurants, go out a lot, travel…?

And finally if you were in my shoes what would you do ? A lot people say I’m crazy to wanting to go back while others like my parents (Biased?) think it’s better and can live like a « king » here. 

Thanks 🇹🇳","u are such an inspiration man, to achieve what u achieved at 25 years old is unusual und magnificent. And u seem to be more mature and u know what u want in life, i have no informations relating to what u are asking but i wish u all the best.","I've thought about moving back from Germany myself, but whenever I see Tunisians at the airport, hear them talk, then see the animals working at the Tunis International Airport, I drop that plan entirely. 

There is no price tag on safe streets, available medicine, non-criminal cops, water, electricity and no commies having a say in the local economy.","First of all congrats bud, what you are doing is freaking impressive and you are doing incredible.

I have lived studied and worked abroad and I am fully back to tounis and I don’t regret my decision one bit. I don’t have the kind of cushy gig like you but I am making enough money to live very well and mayonkosni chay but I am paid in dinars and not dollars. Basically, 300$ are more than enough to eat often at restaurants, travel across the country by car. (I’m not factoring alcohol because I don’t drink)

For the taxation questions, you need an accountant and to make a batinda here. You will be able to bring in your dollars legally, use them as dollars and convert them legally as well.

For FCR, you need to make a copy of your entire passport and CIN. Head to your nearest kbaadha and ask for مطلب اعلام برجوع نهائي. You fill it out and that’s all.

One last thing, I’m a minimalist, I don’t consume a lot (other than videogames). The offer in tounis is very limited and good quality items is sold at a markup. If you’re a shopping aficionado, be warned.

P.S: I’m a quantitative researcher at a hedge fund here, If you ever think of opening a startup here hit me up.","I'd suggest you give it a try 1st... come and stay for a month or 2 and see how you feel about that 1st, then decide whether you wanna come back for good or not. I have siblings who live abroad they're always looking forward to come visit but 1 week in maximum and they're already fed up and want to get back. Quality of life and services hits different here. There are things that you can't control even with your high income.","Even the whiniest Tunisians will tell you that it's a great country if you're in the top 10%, with that salary you will rank higher than that. The situations is deteriorating every time I go there unfortunately and more and more people are leaving. For example tap water is unstable in the summer, the supply of certain goods is unstable. Crime is bit on the rise with the robbings. What you can do is buy a house in a very good neighborhood in a nicer city (Marsa, Monastir come to mind) and get away from most of the problems. I feel the same way in Germany btw, it's not racist, just very dull. Also trying to make it with crypto. Not going back anytime soon though.

>Eat often at fancy restaurants, go out a lot, travel…?

It's not much cheaper. Meat and fish costs about the same as here (about $13 a kilo). One nice thing here is that the quality is so superior to europe's if you're into that (I am!). Nice restaurants cost $10-20 a meal. So as for food and going out, you can have everything at $1000 a month even if you're wasteful. A nice house will cost you $500k.

>And finally if you were in my shoes what would you do ?

I would look for another arab country to move to, you're muslim so that helps. Buy a house in Tunisia, go there 3 months a year to enjoy and realize why I moved away in the first place, it's what the rich Tunisians I know do except they're based in Europe.",2023-12-23 14:09:34

I've registered 5 phones total using my passport, my wife's and my kid's on the website, free of charge.

It would also be lit to have a community where we can share knowledge experiences and discuss interesting papers and ideas that might shape the future of the industry.

6- Sell 50% of interior regions and the North-West to Algeria (Tbarka stays tho, too lovely than Algeria deserves)

7- Sell the South to Libya

8- Give Nestlé complete control over our agriculture

9- Government workers can legally own their job and pass it on to their children.

10- Every Tunisian should pimp out at least 3 women from his family to Libyans and Algerians

11- Ban private investment for anyone who isn't سي فلان (See number 5). That also goes for small shops and cafés 

The plans for education, culture and politics: 

1- Remove STEM subjects and emphasize more on dancing, theater and sexual education.

2- Grant UGTT and UGET complete control over all universities (even the private ones). Yelling and beating your professors is how everyone should get their degree. Learning and exams are classist and part of an international capitalist conspiracy.

3- Inmates with life sentences and on death row are to be rehabilitated in Tunisian public schools along with our children

4- Unions are allowed to own guns and heavy weaponry. Physical education teachers can now diddle your kids at gunpoint. So no more need for strikes (legal or illegal) تضامنا مع الزميل when he gets caught

5- Foreign currency should only be used for concerts 

6- Abolish the Ministry of Culture and turn it straight into an ATM for actors and other ""artists"". No need to pretend that they're producing anything anymore (fewer ministries = less salaries to pay)

7- Forgive Israel for Operation Wooden Leg. We shouldn't be as whiny as the US with 9/11 and Pearl Harbor

8- Replace ""Allah"" in all official documents with ""Bourguiba"" 

9- Expose Farhat Hached as the traitor he is for trying to ruin the good thing we're having with France.

10- Remove article 1 of the constitution for more transparency. We're not a real country, we're not independent and we definitely aren't arab or muslim.

11- Pictures of Ben Ali are mandatory again

18nwzim,https://i.redd.it/gl3y8mysbp7c1.jpeg,72,One of The Best Things We Did Was When We Legalized Abortion in 1973 and the Debate Ended There.,,Actually the gestational limit in Tunisia is 13 weeks and 6 days.,"Tbh let the people live the way they want.
I'm muslim by choice hamdoullah and I still agree with this law. Why? Because not everyone in Tunis is muslim!
People need to get that into their thick skull.
The Prophet (p.b.u.h.) said himself that nobody should be forced into Islam but join by his own volition.

I know that nowadays most say they're muslim but they give a rat's ass about adhering to the Quran, its revelations and the Prophets (p.b.u.h.) teachings.
They bend it like it fits them and go on.

Tbh I don't care at all if I know someone who's not muslim or a pretend-to-be-muslim to chase after him and tell him what's wrong and what's right. It's their damn business. I only give advice when I'm specifically asked.

The way the law on abortion is right now fits Tunis as we would have a lot of fatherless children indeed and as you know a majority of those tend to grow messed up unfortunately because they were raised in an unhealthy environment.

If a guy is willingly chasing after women or a women is chasing after guys then he/she exactly knows what they're doing and also know that it is unislamic and they will definitely not care about it as they either have no Iman or simply aren't muslim.

Nobody has a right to berate them as it is futile to do so. That's the current shape of the world we're living in right now.

If they choose promiscuity it's their life.
If you're concerned about your own children then see to it to raise them the way you think is right.
If you want them to be proper muslims then teach them about it in a friendly non-manipulative way and pray to Allah that he will guide them down a righteous path.
If you don't care about it then try raising them so that they'll be a functional happy human that has a good moral compass and won't be a menace to society.","Extremely impressive. No country needs thousands of fatherless children running around. Many become either criminals, or religious fanatics.",In the UK you have the right to an abortion up to 24 weeks and then after that in certain circumstances such as risk to mother etc.,"Thank God, we would have a lot of fatherless children asking why their Libyan daddy doesn't visit them in Tunis or the Sahel",2023-12-21 20:51:42

hi everyone naqra bac math sna w lezemni njib moyen minimum 16 bch nmchi lel haja eli nhebha . Thus, i've been struggling with my mental health since i was 16years old let's say . i went to psychiatrist today and she didn't help at all because she didn't understand my issue ( maybe i didn't know how to express my feelings because it's the first time opening up to a person) i have another session next month and i hope i can try to explain to her more abt my issues and life .

Anyway , i'm here today seeking help because i need to study cuz time is running out and i'm completely lost . I have had good marks since 1ere annee (moyen mte3i mayti7ch m17) until 3eme annee, my marks started going down (jebt 15 moyen ) w fil bac 1ere trimester netsawerch nakhlet hete l13 moyen noteti tay7in 3lkher. But since 2eme annee , i feel really empty inside i have no purpose in life i'm living but i'm not living ( i'm physically present but mentally absent ) i have a goal and i want to achieve it but this goal progressively started to faint as i get older and start to realize that it's hard to reach it (i want to be a software engineer) . Adding to that , I have never been happy with my self or what i did , i always blame myself for everything , i'm too hard on myself but i can't help it . Moreover, when i look at myself i can't find something that makes me unique or interesting basically i'm stupid , ugly and disgusting maybe the only good thing is my personality since i have great mindset and kindhearted as my friends say ( i don't claim that). Also, i'm that therapist friend that everyone feels safe talking to and expressing their feelings which made me feel exhausted and numb because it's hard for me to not only handle my problems but also listen to my friend's problems and try to help them . Sadly, i have never tried to reach out to someone because when i compare my problems with others i feel like it's not worth to be sad about so i accept the fact that now one will listen to me and ignore that problem and live with it holding that sad feelings inside me and try to move on but i never did ( it's clearely not a good solution to get over my problems ) . Besides, when i'm studying i don't feel like i accomplish something even if i solve a quiete hard exercise i feel like i did nothing special and everyone will get it easily .

So please if u have an idea or a solution on how can i ignore my feelings again and start stduying like i was in 1ere annee ( bgalb w rab kime ngolo) tell me

Bon courage","U are in a bad situation, it's not a subject could be handled in texting but really hope you get through it. Think i have something would help you resist your negative feelings but it's way too late. as i said u have to resist your feelings. I suggest first to expand your circle of philosophical knowledge. Some philosophical orientations would give you the push and the urge to complete and i prefer to take a look of the nihilism/absurdism/stoicism. And also some psychological knowledge would help you to understand yourself way better an open your eyes much wider. All of that is just a resistance(short term solution) its consequences would be so bad in a long term but it's the only way i could see(i have bac too this year, wouldn't compare who's mental health worst but that helps me specially which i have those knowledge before)","Try to open up to the therapist more , may be try to write how you feel and what are your concerns so you will be able to communicate more your inner thoughts and issues .

About the self love thing I once was in your place  but I was younger , I was in middle school then , I didn't totally hate myself but I had some kind of hopelessness and the positive thing then was that I was a in the top my class , that made me feel assured and made my sorrow less .But I overcome it,  wasn't easy , it was a lot of hard work , of self reflection and self improvement, I read books and watched tv shows that talked about personal development. Seeing a therapist at that time would've been a privilege. So my friend, don't wait for the motivation to come , sit on the chair now and try to enjoy studying that helped in Bac. Try to think not about the Bac, shift your mindset , think of what happened as an opportunity to start the race with a more powerful mindset. Still plenty of time to study and you can achieve that . And considering you had good grades in the previous years that means you have potential and the ground for sucess, you have to enjoy the process of learning so that might decrease the pressure of achieving and performing . Make a plan and try to be consistent as possible as you can and try to be your first priority , and say no to distractions. Make studying cosy and kind of routine to make it less intimidating. How about thinking like a scientist when you solve a physical dilemma or like a philosopher when you read a text , they are normal people too , see Bac as a pleasure challenge not a dead end. I know it sounds poetic , but it's good to change our perspectives and take a step back and see things from another corner.

So I've been studying in a Chinese program (via my university here) and now that it's the last year we are required to go to china and finish the last year there (4 months language, 2months  holiday and four months pfe ) 
The thing is the Chinese university said that the visa will be for one year and we're expected to go there on the 7th of march. 
Now the problem lies with the papers and the procedure 
According to my research I don't need that much papers : -admission letter 
- jw paper 
-online visa application 
- photos and a copy of the passport 
-attestation des fonds (2500$ par an) 
That's all but unfortunately the university is the one providing the jw and admission letter and they won't do so until January 
So can anyone help me in any kind and walk me throu the procedure of applying to visa ( TLS ,embassy ....) Or if am missing any papers 
What is this paper called ""attestation des fonds "" and how do I do it, how long does it take to get an answer for the visa .... 
Any help is appreciated and thank you guys","Two months (January to March) normally should be plenty of time to process it, but make sure you are filling out all parts of all forms completely correctly and don't make any spelling mistakes or accidental inconsistensies, because it may make them deny your visa and force you to start over.

Attestation des fonds is a proof that you have this amount of money in your personal capacity. Its purpose is to ensure that you'll be able to finance yourself while you're there. If the program is funding things like school fees, food and housing, you probably only need proof of that. If you're self-funding it all, probably the way to get this document is have your bank (or your parents' bank, depending on your situation) create it.

Sounds like an amazing opportunity and good luck.",May i ask what university do you study in and what field,,,,2023-12-21 13:03:30

Hey Reddit friends,

I've always wanted to try fishing, but I never had the time or money for it. Luckily, now that I'm working as a freelancer, I've got both! But here's the thing: I'm totally new to fishing. I haven't bought any gear yet, and I really need some advice.

I live in Ariana, Tunisia, so I can easily go to any beach nearby. But I don't know what kinds of fish we have here. Can anyone tell me about the local fish?

Also, do I need a license to fish here, or is it okay without one? And I could really use some tips on what equipment and bait to get. If you know anything about fishing, please share your knowledge with me. I'm super excited to start fishing and would appreciate any help you can give.

arresting these people, was quite daring and really accepted by most people since they are known to have meddeled too much into politics for their own personal gain, some of them didn't yet had a ""faux pas"" with the others and got pulled into this too.After 6 months of arrest the narrative changes, again naturally, to the need to accelerate a prosecution as the public needs to know who did them bad and who didn't.

after 9 months the need for that knowledge is no longer necessary and the public stopped caring, and now these people are used by the regime as scape goats, to pull other people into the prosecution and extend and embellish in the antoginisation of ""el mouta2emirin"" ala ""goldestein"".

with this extension of the arrest period, we are eveolving this case even more to, in my view, an even more abuse of power and hardships put on people whoes crimes are way eclipsed the general guilt the regime has stuck to them. and by consequence, creating a an ennemy, although has a legitimate source, is 99% fictional and is used to frighten people. A very simlar situation to ""rawabit himeyit el thawra"", this time it's in our heads.

at night it's simple not advisable even for men because there are drunkards and high people at large (generally after 22h), and they tend to be troublesome to everyone around them, not just women. although it's more dangerous for a woman. there isn't much reason to go out at night anyway. it's too cold and there is nothing out there since everyone just prefers to be at home burried in their blankets.

Not a hasbara bot, just driven here by the algorithm. Normally, I would not interact with your sub, but the nature of your post leads me to think maybe you could hear me out.

I'm not Tunisian, but my grandmother came to Palestine from Morroco. Morroco is well known for being relatively safe for Jews. Many Jews and even Israeli Jews of Moroccan background travel to Morroco to maintain cultural ties. 

But safe is not the same thing as well treated. My Savta refuses to talk about it, but my mom told me that her family was treated....not well. lots of discrimination against them for being Jewish, and refusal to employ her father. So were they expelled from Morroco? No. No they were not expelled.

Did my mother's mother feel welcome to stay in Morocco as a Jew? *Absolutely not.* And that's why they booked it to Palestine in 1947. Much of my family is Israeli as a direct result of this.

I want to share this story so you understand that some Jews from Arab lands felt pressure to emigrate even if there wasn't legal expulsion. (That being said, there were countries that were very violent towards their Jews, like in Iraq. However, none of my family is from Iraq, so I will leave that to an Iraqi Jew to explain).

There's a lot of daylight between expulsion and ethnic cleansing and equal treatment. I think you have lots of Jews who felt discrimination and pressure and even violence and so they left, even in countries where expulsion wasn't a government mandate.

(For the record, if it makes you feel better, I am disgusted with Bibi and consider him a criminal. I am horrified by the current mass deaths in Gaza. I don't support Hamas, but I also dont support Bibi and his right wing government and have not for a very long time. Also, I don't even live in Israel anymore, so please don't yell at me to get out of Palestine....I already left!)","My grandma's close friend was a Jew from Gabes whose son was ""saving to buy land in Palestine"" long before the pogroms.   
When Guy de Maupassant visited Tunis in the late 19th century, he called it a ""jewish city"" because he was impressed at how confident the Jews were living amongst other Tunisians in comparison to Europe.","Tunisia didn't expell jews, many non jewish people hid jews during the German occupation of tunis .
And even long before that, jews were a part of the community. Sidi me7rez for instance, vocated for the inclusion of jewish neighborhood inside the walls of the medina. And was known as the protector of jews.
If they qere expelled,  how come we still have jewish families living in lafayette, jerba, la goulette.... and refusing to join Israel even though they were promised houses and lands there","It's the Israeli narrative.. ""we told the arabs tgat we want to live together in peace but they attacked us and deported their jewish communities to us"" all been debunked by historians","In Tunisia, Jews were not kicked out no. They largely moved to France and Israel for economic (many people were boycotting them at the time) and ideological (Zionism) reasons. Riots did happen whenever conflicts happened in Palestine but the state did not endorse the violence and actively persecuted its assailants. But it can be said that those riots made Jews feel unwelcome in the country, that can't be denied, and it was certainly a factor in them moving out.",2023-12-20 15:59:15

""Then why didn't you go back there?""

""I got this excuse thing with stuff and shit""","Its not as black & white. The actua lifestyle in the west comes with many HUGE problems but they are hidden underneath the surface. I'll share my perspective frlm Canada.

1) the weather. Shovelling snow for hours, barely being able to drive without an accident, your car rusting away in one year, the COLD, for most of the year, it is so so so cold its crazy. Have you ever spent an hour in -45 degrees ? Your snot and tears freeze right on your face. Its intense and its MOST of the year. Even health complications happen more often, my mom slid on ice and broke some fingers, my uncle has developped arthritis, etc.

2) Cost of living. Granted you make WAY more money even in the shittiest job but everything costs so much more and the worst part is, this society is fuelled by debt. Instead of buying a phone, i have to finance it and pay it over 2 years. Cars are financed too,'housing, etc.
Its extremely easy to get into debt and very hard ro get out of. 

3. Community values & living. There is no sense of national identity. You are always looked at as a foreigner. You will deal with racism, ( i got death threats and i was born here) 
Lack of community life means you rarely can trust strangers, there is no activity in which you regularly get to know your community. Dating is hard and the majority of potential partners are absolute garbage, Tunisia wins hands down in this category. It also means that kids get mostly kicked out of the house when they turn 18  and parents get sent to centers for old people once they cant take care of themselves.

I have worked in these centers during covid, Tunisia might be bad but the fact that we take care of our parents until their deaths is amazing. The shit i have seen is insane. I saw elderly people die of THIRST. 
I saw them stay in their shit-filled diapers for DAYS.
I saw them have no contact with basicallly anyone, i saw them cry, struggle , etc. 

This is one of the MANY ways that the individualistic lifestyle of the west (canada) has caused a dramatic shift in community life but its not one aspect only, you WILL FEEL IT EVERYDAY, and you will miss Tunisia, because for all its flaws and assholes, it is a BEAUTIFUL country, but also, the people are mostly extremely loving & caring.

PS- i brought 4 friends from Canada last summer to come experience Tunisia, they have travelled every continent and dozens of countries. Tunisia was their favourite by far and they will be coming back next year. Don't under estimate our country, its unique.","I haven't been abroad for a long time to draw any conclusions but here's my two cents : while my life here is a decent upgrade from that in Tunisia (in terms of quality of services, infrastructure, open mindedness of people...) the individualistic society here will leave you yearning for a sense of belonging. There are things that I hate and that made me leave Tunisia but I also recognise it is my home and where I belong and find meaningful connection with people that matter to me.",w ykarzou ki t9oul tounes matnajemch t3ich feha w t7eb tokhrej,"Never met anyone like that, everyone I met spit on the country profusedly","W tal9ah hey kol sif yetzaber 3al 5ale9 b 500 euro

This doesn't only include random ordinary people but also many famous people. For example, Tawfik Gharbi and Mondher Jridi every time they are on TV the only thing you'll hear them saying is how TV directors didn't see the great actor qualities in them and that that is reason why they hadn't had many important roles in their careers. 

It is so typical of that type of people that they will try always to put the blame on someone else instead of assuming the responsibility of their own deeds. For example both have been (and very probably are still are) alcohol addicts and that has undoubtedly led to them taking bad decisions in their lives which affected their careers. I mean, if you are unwise enough to have fallen victim for alcohol addiction then the likelihood that you have taken many other bad decisions in your life is quite big. 

Moreover, it is one of the very very basics of personal development literature that the one big difference between successful people and those who are not successful is exactly this: successful people do take responsibility for what they do while others try always to find someone else or something else to blame. I mean, you're not as good actor as you think and you have not always taken the right decisions in your life. Do understand this and do admit it and then you will notice a change in your life. This of course applies to the approximately 8 to 10 millions other Tunisians who have the same mentality.",,,,,,2023-12-20 13:28:05

I'm curious to know your thoughts on the current political situation, particularly regarding immigration laws. How are you feeling about it, and what are your plans? I've heard some friends mention they're considering leaving France – is that something you're contemplating as well?","Nothing Special about the new law. ([Here](https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2023/12/19/projet-de-loi-immigration-tout-ce-qui-a-change-entre-le-projet-initial-la-version-du-senat-et-de-l-assemblee-et-celle-de-la-cmp_6205115_4355771.html#huit-anchor-durcissement-des-conditions-d) is the digest of it)

Basically it is making life harder for illegals in some aspects (but also added some positive things), and for those who commit crimes.

Some social aids were made harder to get, but, those who are here with stable situations, don't need them.

Some conditions added for those who want to bring their families (regroupement familial)

Overall, life in France is not bad, if you watch the news channels like BFM and Cnews (which are the worst and the most buzz/sensational driven channels, plus a lot of their guests are openly racist), or if you follow news on Facebook and such, you may think it is hell on earth for migrants, but it is not. The reality is way different. As an example, when the Israeli army started its massive attacks on Gaza, the interior minister, Darmanin, decreed that all protests and marches in support of Palestine will be automatically banned, the constitutional court overruled that decree because it is illegal. This is a peek on how things work here, and the rule of law is actually a thing here. So as an immigrant, I know that the law will protect me when I need it, and if I am a victim of some racist action, I know that the law will protect my rights. Yep, racist crimes are no joke here, and they don't go unpunished. Eric Zemmour (an others) where condemned for racist declarations, more than once, no one is above the law.

French people are actually nice toward immigrants, some of them (leftist mainly) defend the immigrants, even the illegals, and find that the state is way too harsh on them. It is true that lately the french politicians are becoming more and more extremists, but its a wave hitting all the world, not just France, and we've seen that in Tunisia too.

French people don't really care about this new law, it does not concern them at all, other than a bunch of ignorant racists. Their main concerns is inflation, education, health care, retirement, the environment, public services, cost of life... you know every problems that every one in the world worry about. Statistics show that there is no relevant increase of violence due to immigration, but the French media and the french right wing politicians are exaggerating every thing, and even lying about it, and you know there is a saying ""a lie is said in 15 seconds, explaining that it is a lie takes 15 minutes"".

Do I think that I will leave France someday soon? It is highly unlikely, and even if I left, I will not be going back to Tunisia, I will go to the UK or Germany. Tunisia is unlivable right now, and I don't think that things are going to be any better, any time soon. I am actually having a good life here, I have a great job with a good salary, my kid goes to school, I live in a nice city, I have never been a victim of any kind of agression, some people are just impolite, but that's how things are in big cities, but most people are respectful, much more than Tunisians toward each other. I am never afraid or stressed about being the victim of any discrimination. So far, only once, some woman talked down to me, about some administrative protocol, I just showed her the text proving I was right and she was wrong, she just shut her clap. but other than that, I have a normal life, almost as if I was in my native country.

Those who think that they are going home at some point, because France is racist are overreacting in my opinion, they didn't think it through. Especially if they have kids. There are some basic quality services you find here that you can't find in Tunisia, Free health care, free good quality public education, public transport... and a lot of other things you don't find in Tunisia.

You may think, but if you don't come back, who is gonna make the country better: well sorry, I tried, I lost my job trying to make a little change, and how was that rewarded? People voted for Ennahdha and Kalb Tounes, and voted For KS and NK for presidency, and when KS overthrew the democratic process (even if it was going bad) and all the illegal arrests and persecution of the opposition, they cheered. Sorry man, but I can't make any more sacrifices for this people, I have other responsibilities now, it is not my fight anymore

That was my opinion and rant, feel free to ask me anything you want","I hope they reduce immigration to 0 and deny citizenship to everyone from Africa.

It will hurt France more than it will hurt Africa since they have an aging population. We've already seen the response to the increase in retirement age.

Tunisians and other educated Africans will no longer migrate to France (Europe as a whole) which will help mitigate the brain drain. My hope is that the government take advantage of this situation to utilize the returning diaspora.

France has never treated Tunisians (or any other African) as equals despite everything they do for the country. I hope this is just another step towards the end of Françafrique.","We are tired of the mafia and criminals that dirty our name here, I hope France actually does something about them and opens up immigration only for people actually motivated by the country",Shiiiit,"Overall

On a personal note, I'm gearing up to tie the knot soon, so it would be fantastic to connect with couples who share similar interests. If my future wife is available to join in on the fun, that would be the cherry on top!

A bit about me:

* I'm passionate about hiking and cycling, so if you enjoy the great outdoors, we're off to a great start! 
* Whether it's the latest blockbuster or a hidden indie gem, I love movies and would be thrilled to catch a film or binge-watch a series with new friends. 
* Music is a big part of my life, and while I appreciate all genres, I'm particularly heavy on rock. Let's swap playlists and discover new tunes together!
* Sports and fitness are key elements in my routine, and I'm always up for a good workout or a friendly sports match. 
* I'm a sucker for intellectual discussions, especially those centered around science and weird facts. If you enjoy engaging in thoughtful debates, we're on the same wavelength!

18lfa7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/18lfa7p/ben_ali_regime/,4,Ben Ali regime,Cause i didn't live much under Ben Ali regime i want to hear your honest opinion about his Regim. and how life was back then .,"It was a functioning dictatorship in which 91% of it occurred before the 2008 crisis, this fact is incredibly important as after that event, the entire world got hit, everything became more expensive and life quality dropped in most developing-countries. 

&nbsp;

This is my view of the old regime in a nutshell:

* Economically: 
 * we weren't in shitty condition like now, but we weren't Malisya or South Korea either. 
 * Circumstances + Competent ministers + limited amount of people with high ambition driven by corruption (his family and few others)

 * This resulted in the mini-prosperity old people are talking about now. 

 * Sea-side cities had it **MUCH BETTER** than the internal region, this was a huge mistake Bourguiba did, but Ben Ali also continued to build on it, contrary to most believes, I personally think they didn't do that out of spite, they were just lazy incompetent leaders with primitive visions. 

&nbsp;

* Ambitions: 
 * Imo this was the key factor, I am 30y.o now, I was 17 when the revolution happened, I truly remember a time (from ~1999 to ~2007) where ""leveling up"" financially was something that people truly believed in, whether by education, or some self-made business, it was a time where going to school ""made sense"", and a lot of people believed it in it, getting your bac was like a super main event that can open real doors, etc...

 * after that, the whole mentality shifted, becoming a jobless engineer who end up working ""mramma"" became a ""meme"", the big push for ""takwin mehni"" despite its usefulness also built a general picture of ""higher education is useless"". 

 * combine that with the corruption of ""lezem 3andek m3aref"" to do anything, the global economical crisis, and the general dictatorship vibe (any cop could literally ruin your life if you were in the wrong time/wrong place) and the result was [the 2008 revolution attempt](https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A3%D8%AD%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AB_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%88%D8%B6_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%86%D8%AC%D9%85%D9%8A) (it happened there because these regions really had it much worse than the sea-side cities)


&nbsp;

* Feeling of oppression : 
 * doesn't matter who you are or what are your political believes, at one point, you were going to be forced to do a little bit of ""ass kissing"" to the system, it can be something as simple as your primary school teacher pressing you (a 9y.o kid) to buy the 26/26 calendar, or forcing you to greet the president publically during 15 octobre event (nik ommou le mchit!) 

 * knowing, for a fact, that a cop, can and will at anytime bully the shit out of you for no reason, and no matter how many hard evidence you have, justice will never serve you. (you can imagine all sort of scenarios here, from being beaten in the stadium, to a random cop having a crush on your gf/fiancé and make it his life mission to harass the shit out of you)

 * bribery is the official national sport. 


&nbsp; 

So yeah, personally I don't miss it, and as much as i hated the incompetent cunt who ruled after 2010, at least the game got balanced a little, I literally restored the ""ambition"" part back, I can do shit on my own and not be afraid of the president cousin popping out of no where to to split the goods with me, [his brother was literally a drug trafficker who got killed by the Italian Mafia for overstepping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couscous_connection) (lolz)

&nbsp;

And this is why in my opinion, [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-OFxu85_sc) was the most popular underground song during my highschool years, it lasted for years! first time i listened to it i was 6emme primaire, but me and my friends randomly played it on occasions up until bac (revolution year +1).

&nbsp;

And this is coming from a middle-class person who lived in Bizerte (city), 15 minutes away on foot from the beach, had a computer and playstation since i can remember, imagine how it was for people who were much less fortunate. 

&nbsp;

So yeah, 

I'll take bad management over bullying anytime of the day, the problem is in recent years power abuse has been coming back and the people are busy cheering for their ""party leader"" while laughing on the misery of the other ""party members"", but that's politics in the whole world.

&nbsp;

And this is why this is the best summary for democracy: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFgcqB8-AxE","Ironically, when he first got to power, he promised political freedoms and actually released a lot of Nahdhawists out of prison, a couple of years later he pulled out the biggest reverse card and single handedly wiped them out of Tunisia, he turned out to be even worse than Bourguiba when it comes to freedoms, as for the economy he wasn't that bad but in the 2000's the situation was getting worse and worse.","It really wasn't great, as much as people try to paint it.

Salaries were as low as possible to maximize the money Ben Ali's clique could put in their pockets, but not so low that it would trigger a popular revolt. You got enough to get by and you should be thankful for it (and you won't be able to change shit if you weren't thankful for it).

The balance was disrupted following the 2008 crisis when that bare minimum now became worthless and people actually started demanding change. The 2008 Tunisian protests were arguably the prelude to the revolution and were brutally put down to prevent them from spreading out of the mining basin of Gafsa (it did spread but not significantly enough).

To get anything done you needed relatives and friends in power (el aktaf), and be ready to pay a ton of bribes along the way. People keep shitting on today's bureaucracy when before the revolution it was just as incompetent and much more corrupt.

Angering someone in power was a coin flip between rotting for a decade in a prison and a death sentence. The police could abuse and torture without impunity. If an officer stops you in the street you should start praying he won't get you in trouble in the hope of extracting a bribe of you or otherwise ruin your life.

The regime also neglected all sectors other than tourism. The agricultural and industrial sectors that were developed under Bourguiba were basically destroyed to fund the hotel owners who were close to the regime. Half of the country were neglected as a result (though that didn't start with Ben Ali for sure).

And I suppose it goes without saying, but political rights and freedom of speech were non-existent. My father was part of the university police at the time and you will be shocked by how common informants also were.","If you see anyone giving a positive opinion about that period, it is for one of the two reasons:  
1- they did not suffer any harm from Ben Ali's regime, meaning that they just went with it, and tried to get benefit from it  
2- They were actually making some kind of profit out of it, either socially, or financially: A lot of the ""aristocrats"", ""new rich"" and ""bourgeoisie"" were protected from any ""harm"" from the rest of the population, also known as ""zwewla"" (not just the poor, but everyone who is not rich).

In the following part I will use the terms ""rich"" and ""poor"" to name the two groups mentioned previously.

Examples of that, those who don't belong in some rich neighborhood, are chased away by the police, so if some young man from Ettahrir or Sidi Hassine (taking the example of Tunis, but it is also true for people coming from Jendouba/Kef or any of the southern poorer regions, to Tunis) is having some errand, or just hanging out in Marsa and Sidi Boussaid, and the police stops him for identification (and see immediately that his address does not match the area) he will be treated like shit and ordered to leave and go back to where he belongs. Especially this behavior kept happening after 2011. The message is, the ""poor"" do not belong around the rich, and they are a threat to them, the regime protects the rich from the poor, the only poor allowed around the rich are the ones who work for them. This message is well understood among the two groups: the ""rich"" understood that the regime is with them, and they will use that advantage to abuse the ""poor"", and the ""poor"" lived in that state of fear and submission to the ""rich"", and to avoid causing any problems, even if they are the victims of the abuse, because the ""rich"" can get them arrested and beaten.

You may think that this is just a pile of crap, told by someone who just hated the old regime, but I actually lived among the ""rich"", and saw how they acted all the time. I always avoid saying where I live, just to avoid that look and that judgement from people who don't know me.

My family moved from a middle class neighborhood to a ""rich"" one when I was still in elementary school, so I was around middle class people, at home and at school before we moved, and I stayed at the same school for a couple of years even after we moved. BUT, It was a shock for me, when I started going to middle school (college) in the new ""rich"" neighborhood,  to see how ""rich"" people behaved. Our middle school had some students from a neighboring poor area (really poor) and I saw how the rich kids where making fun of the poor ones because they were poor. For me it was the first time I saw that. In my previous school, we had some poor kids, kids knew which kids were the poor, and that was it. No one ever made fun of them because of their situation. We played together, sat together, ate together, I mean it was the natural way to act. But in ""rich"" middle school, rich and poor don't mix, they don't sit with them, they don't speak to them, they don't play with them, and don't share food with them. My first weeks there, I didn't know any kids, so I sat randomly in any empty spot I found, so eventually, I sat with some girl, who turns out to be one of the poor, the whole class (especially boys) looked at me and laughed at me, because I was sitting with the poor girl.  
This is some context to what comes next: during that first year, 3 poor students (boys) got expelled permanently from that school for having a fight with one of the rich kids, the rich kids were the ones who started the fights, and were making fun of the poor ones for weeks. The expelled kids were no angels neither, but for the same offenses, rich kids never got expelled. I saw this happening again and again every year during middle school and high school, ""Rich"" kids comforted by their social status, bullying the poor. Some of them personally knew some police officers, and they would call them directly when they wanted to scare the shit out of some poor guy who offended them by breathing the wrong way.  
And this a pattern was spread all around the country (and still is) and that has always existed since the Bey's era, and Ben Ali reinforced it and used it to shut down any possibility of rebellion and any thought of opposing the regime. Someone with a high a status will automatically flaunt it in the face of any one who dares to offend him, and when under threat, will run directly to the police, who will automatically track the ""offenders"" and turn their lives into a living hell.

This, in a nutshell, is what the Ben Ali's regime looked like, pitting the two groups against each other, and of course giving the advantage to the rich. All that, and the corruption induced by this system, the theft of public resources, the degradation of health and education systems... some talk about prosperity during Ben Ali's era, we all discovered it was all bullshit on the break of the 2010-2011 protests.

It is true that the governments and parliaments that came after 2011 did not make things right, and did not save the economy, but what can you do when the system is deeply corrupt, and the corrupting forces are way stronger than those who want to fight them. Never forget what happened to Fakhfakh government, the first government ever that was really going to act on its promises of fighting the corruption and saving the country.

Those who are gonna hate on this, I don't care about your opinions, just bring facts if you think what I am saying is wrong","POV of a someone born in 1990.
Ben Ali was a dictator. No doubt. Terrorizing anyone thinking about opposing his political orientation.
We were literally afraid of saying his name out loud in public.
His wife's family aka ltrabilsia were like a parallel customs taking advantage of their power to get richer.

Otherwise, for the average ayech Tunisian, not interested in Politics, nor having a profitable big business, for him, the situation was times better than now.
U can get a 'decent' public healthcare, your kids can get a good free public education, vegetables prices were ranging between 0.3 to 0.7 dt as an average. Chicken around 2 or 3 dt, Meat probably some 10dt..
Euros to DT maybe 1.2 or so...

18l43pv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/18l43pv/kais_said_conspiracy_theory/,4,Kais Said Conspiracy Theory,"let me tell you about President Kais Said. Some people, they're saying he's just another player in the corrupt game, you know? Blaming him for everything – food shortages, water issues, you name it. It's a disaster!  
and some will say that powerful lobbies are apparently playing games, thinking he's gonna stir the pot too much. They're trying to sabotage him left and right, like it's a reality show.  
what do you think?

 I'm not deep into politics, but that's the chatter I've picked up. If you've got the real scoop or a solid read on this, i would love to hear it. ","He is just another player in the corrupt game, but many players are playing in that game at the same time, not just KS. But at the end of the day, Tunisia is in a conundrum that stems primarily from debt to financial institutions.

What you'll see is that these huge international lending institutions have worked with Tunisian governments - especially around and after 2014 - who were super enthusiastic and blinded by these foreign economists in fancy suits coming in with their policies in exchange for loans that would help the economy short-term and give the local politicians here a chance at reelection. These policies follow classical neoliberal macro-economics with no regard for local circumstances: in particular, deregulation, opening the market to foreign investors and businesses, tax system restructuring (especially replacing income and corporate taxes with VAT/consumption taxation), and cutting public sector expenditures, including on subsidies and public expenditures like healthcare, education, sanitation, etc. (sometimes with the ultimate goal of privatization).

So everytime the IMF comes back to Tunisia with a new debt arrangement, it will include a further erosion of the public sector, which had historically in Tunisia failed to actually improve the economy but rather has shrunk its ability to invest while accumulating more debt. In fact, at the moment, Tunisia is spending roughly the same amount in its yearly budget on debt servicing as it is taking on new debt.

Of course, these loans are in foreign currency which allows import of essential foodstuffs, which are necessary in Tunisia because the agricultural sector was restructured with the same technical advice from international lending institutions to a point where the staples are no longer produced domestically. 

It's my interpretation that KS is attempting to address this in a 'soft way' by limiting imports, which has a short-term negative impact on the economy and is painful for consumers, but which may help alleviate Tunisia's dependence on these lending institutions in the long-term and allow Tunisia to follow more expansive financial policies that give the opportunity for public investment in for instance sufficiency-focused agriculture. However, it's a very slow burn without certainty of success because everything around it is so fraught.

A few countries and large popular movements are recognizing that these lending practices are inherently exploitative and unfair and call for broader debt cancelation around the world. Countries like Tunisia would be able in principle to organize a broadbased refusal to acknowledge or some debt owed (think of it as a workers' union, but for countries), which would probably be the most productive way to change things around, but it would have profound negative effect on this country's business elites whose fortunes are tied up on relationships with the West that would become shaky at best if Tunisia took such stances. I don't know if KS believes ideologically in this kind of action, but even if he did, I'm sure he wouldn't dare take it.","AFAIK, The gvt has decided (supported by KS) to slow down on importations in order to balance our economy. Despite it being a huge deal for citizens (ie sugar addicts), it's working well for the economy... So we might suffer from shortages, but i really hope this will work well for the future (looks promising, at least for now)","KS is a problem he is the corrupt game

I opened the comment section out of curiosity to see if any experienced people answered and i was shocked by how many comments were telling the girl how skinny she was and how she needs to eat in the worst way possible and i couldn't help it but reply to all of them in most vulgar way cuz i was so triggered.    

And after like 5 minutes I deleted all the replies and started to ask myself on how to treat bullies, should we just be as Stoic as possible or feed them their poison so they can feel how is it like to be bullied.   

What do you think","Bullies when they are in group they think they are “tough” but if you see bullies when they are alone by themselves you will realize that they are miserable, losers and most likely cowards and you can really see their insecurities and fear because they know deep inside that they are not that “tough” as they portray themselves to be and that is when you see their true character’s behind their fake image, remember if you see people that try so hard to act tough or bad infront of others they really aren’t about that in real life when they are alone. How to treat bullies is to not engage with miserable people because that is what they are.","Unfortunately we live in society full of stupid people don't worry they have been raised like that and when they will get the maturity they will know how shit they're.

All support, stay strong 😊",Wecome to the internet. Wear a helmet. The internet has always been like that all over the world.,"By turning the app/computer off, they have no power over you unless you give it to them.","Here's how I deal with bullies: some people aren't even worth a response. If you're confident enough, you won't feel the need to engage with them, whether it's a comment on social media or in real life. However, the situation becomes tricky when the bully holds some level of influence. Any reaction, or lack thereof, will matter to others, so you have to tread carefully. If you know their weak points, exploit them or try to make them feel shame for opening their mouths in the first place.

And please, don't buy into the notion that bullies are miserable in life and insecure. that doesn't matter, All that stuff you tell yourself to find comfort at the end of the day – you've been made fun of, so **Fight back.**",2023-12-18 02:16:47

Do these statements truly reflect the reality of gender imbalances in Tunisia?

Do Tunisian women have equal rights as men? Are there disparities in access to education and job opportunities based on gender in Tunisia? 
 
Do women face more cultural prejudices, sexist stereotypes and obstacles in their lives and careers? How big is the gender pay gap in Tunisia? 

Are equal inheritance, division of assets in married couple, harsher punishments for sexual assault and domestic abuse etc deemed taboo topics in the public opinion or not?

What could be done to improve the situation? In your opinion, can Tunisia achieve full gender equality in the future?","I think we’re doing aight in that department, could be better, there’s obviously room for improvement like inheritance laws and so on. 

Generally the laws in Tunisia are so much better than our Arab counterparts, in terms of gender equality and whatnot, especially concerning divorce, domestic abuse, SA and so on. 

Socially, it depends on where you live, the capital and the coast are more open minded and more accepting of feminist ideas than other states. If you go to a random village in Tunisia you would see that we’re not as progressive as we’d like to think we are. 

Overall, given the circumstances, I say Tunisia is one of the best Arab Muslim countries in terms of gender equality.","I have heard people complain about everything on the streets, but this is not one of the issues they discuss and care about (assuming it's an issue for them as the internet make it seem to be). I've only seen people complain about this online.

A vast amount of men don't even work and rely on their wives to give them their coffee and cigarettes pocket money (which is ridiculous).

Were you obliged to draw a portrait of the current leader? Which education system you prefer?,"Draw a portrait of the leader???
This was Tunisia, not North Korea.

One can criticize a lot about the two first presidents and their entourages but they both made rather wise choices with regard to education (and healthcare). For Ben Ali, I would restrict the positive decisions on education to probably the first half of his „reign“.
At some point, his priority shifted towards keeping the youth off the streets to avoid them turning against him with the result that he only delayed the problem and created his own fall in 2010. The system was diluted, marks became inflationary, everyone got a diploma and then all those young adults with a diploma in their pocket that wasn’t worth much in the real-world economy protested, in the aftermath of the 2008-9 financial crisis.

To come back to your question: the education system has gotten worse in the second half of Ben Ali‘s time and even worse since the revolution.","Alright, where to begin, I am partially deaf and I studied in school under Ben Ali Regime, college and high school.
Let me tell you that there were specials teacher for deaf, in normal schools across the country, I mean they didn't separate us from hearing children, but more like they added second teacher that speaks language sign, to translate the principal teacher and helps us to integrate in the hearing children world, there were 2 of us in class of like 30 hearing children, it is those associations that pay those specials teachers, and associations are being financed by BEN ALI and of course supervised. 
Now, I see all deaf children are being stuck with hearing children with no help, but from us. (deafs that profited from Ben Ali's Era) 

Back then, it was nothing, it was our right, but now, looking back, and I got to say that: it meant the world for me, even my mother told me that if it wasn't Ben Ali, you wouldn't where you are today, you wouldn't even be able to speak.","i only studied under Ben Ali regime.

- from time to time, the administrator will come to your class, & ask every girl that wear hijab to quit the class. education is not for ""metdaynet""
( typically, they do it in exams & the week before exams. ) 

- they will foce you to give them money for  26-26 & other similar shittt, otherwhise you will forbidden from enter your school.

- in the university, there is ""university's police"".  they have nothing to do with the police work, they only make reports about students, & as a student you can find yourself failed in your class & get low marks, just because some ""random police"" write a bad report about you.

2.If you don't have a good place to date, you prefer to date at home.
Is there any chance this could cause trouble with the neighborhood or the police

3.How long do you usually date until you get married? She is in her early 20s. I agree. Love without marriage is void.","Don't worry about number 1.

Number 2 depends heavily on the neighborhood and how much the cops want a bribe. You might also get in trouble with your landlord. Just keep the moaning to a minimum and avoid conservative neighborhoods.

Number 3 depends on how rich you are (unnecessary expensive weddings are a national sport in Tunisia)  and what her life goals are. Could be anywhere from 6 months to a couple of years.","Tunisian law is against sexual relations in 4 cases : 

1 - one of you is under 18 yo

2 - one or both of you is/are married

3 - one of you getting paid for making sex.

4 - you get caught making sex in a house that isn't rented/owned by one of you.

In tunisia, there's no rule for how long we stay together to marry, the girl age is somehow the most important criteria here. Averagely, you start getting pressure to marry when the girl is at 25/26.","0 : welcome, you’re half Tunisian now
1 : as long you both have your identities, no one will bother you 
2 :  it depends on your neighbours or the hood, usually as long there’s no loud voices or stuff like that nothing will happen ( ps : people could be just jealous , it’s not about culture it’s just their personality)
3 : there’s no limit time or deadlines, when you both really get along and understand each other’s and determine your life goals together, that’s the moment

These ""Indians"" most likely refer to Ethiopian or Nubian Christians which wouldn't be surprising as they're also recorded in Armenia in this period. They are said to have had their own name for ""Ifriqia"", “Besecath” or “Besecath”. To have their own independent terminology derived most likely from an independent name for parts of Roman Africa (**Byzacena** or **Byzacium**) like how ""Ifriqia"" itself is derived from ""Africa"" implies an antiquity of familiarity.

Now, in Ethiopian text of this same era, they referred to all Coptic Christians as ""ግብጸዌ"", or ""Gibitsewi"" derived from a coptic transliteration of the Greek term for Egypt, ""Aegyptus"". So, Coptic Christians referred to themselves according to their religion and were present in Algeria-Tunisia for a while even if itinerantly.

Also, it’d be wise if she downloads an app called “Flo” , then you’ll be able to get a good approximation of when safe periods are(highly recommended). If she has normal cycle, day5 is considered safe. But if you’d still be worried, there is an emergency pill that you can get from any pharmacy (otc) that works for up to 5 days after unprotected sex.

Sue that MF. And if you can't, ask others for help. You can DM me too. And If you feel like it's not worth it **at this time**, that's okay. Who cares about those damn pictures over there? You can get your revenge at a later time.

You are still young. The world is HUGE, and there are countless opportunities to meet nice people that you **never** imagined existed. Try to ignore the toxic people around you for good. You'll need to focus on getting the fuck outta there, **NOT** on trying to end your life. It's NOT your problem, it's **their** problem.

Come on.... We're all going to die at some point, **why the hurry tho?** Your life is so precious, and you will only live once.  


As I said, DM me at anytime. \^\^","i know a friend whom had the same experience i guess there is that one good therapist in sousse called souhail , she is way better after ig 3 years of appointments","You can visit Razi emergency at any tile if you feel any kind of discomfort , you'll be taken care of well and it wouldn't be as expensive as a private doctor visit.

Anyway, to answer your question, my psychiatrist is Olfa Makni Hajji in Cité El khadhra if you live in Tunis, she is amazing and literally changed my life.. 
BPD is painful but very treatable as long as effort is put in, I  had consistent therapy for 2 years ( monthly sessions ) and now I only had 1 session this year  I learned to manage my emotions and am living my best life.. I used to have suicidal thoughts EVERY single day of my being and now I am very grateful for my life.. I mean, recovery is a journey with ups and downs but it is beautiful and VERY worth it.. I don't know how  your  finances are, but please make it your priority to get help over spending your money on meaningless temporary pleasures like drinking, drugs etc..

Because a man shall take care of himself, showing emotions between 2 (or more) females is cute and shit and they be consolidating each other and maybe they cry in groups or whatever...

On the other hand, female friends as you said are more open about their struggles so I find it easier to relate to them and be more emotional with them.

My parents have given me a credit card with a large sum of money for me to freely use while studying away from them . I use this money mainly for food since meklt resteau is shit . But when given the chance i buy a few items of clothes (primarily frippe) or makeup .
Since the start of the year i have stupidly spent almost 70% of the money . How can i minimize my spending even more so when the year ends i ll still have a reasonable sum . 
i have stopped buying makeup and clothes for the meantime, now i only buy food/vegetables/chicken etc and water. What else can i do ? Honestly i want to find even a small job so i can get some of the money back into the account before im fkd but with my uni schedule its almost impossible.","yo I spent 3 years away from home and am also a broke uni student, here's how i can survive on 100 dinars a month sometimes more:

_Food and drinks: 

either learn how to cook cheap meals like chakchouka/3ejja/ma9rouna/mar9a or just put on your big girl pants and eat at the restaurant, it may be shit but it's still better than spending 4000 kol youm 3la casse croutet (if you only eat out during lunch time).

when you're with your parents buy things that'll last you the period you're away for breakfast, like wholesale tropico or brownies or something that can last a long time

Always buy water in bulk and in 2L (you could buy one of those Tupperware bottle things when you're with your parents to take some water with you to uni)

NEVER EVER EVER buy anything ml buvette, this one is obvious. t7eb 9ahwa ? bara l 9ahwa cha3biya 74a l fac

_clothing and makeup:

I'd say don't buy anything until it's time for you to go back home, or don't buy anything at all. But I understand it can be tempting, so I suggest you watch for sales and always always calculate how much you're willing to spend and never go beyond that. this goes the same way with make up.

_transportion: 

LEARN YOUR AREA!! get a bus subscription and keep it on you 24/7 (you can put it in your phone case). Considering that almost all universities have both public and student bus lines crossing them, learn how to navigate and exploit that. You can either ask l guichet win station or your classmates

Just before you do anything, always plan your spendings for the entire week and put a limit to how much you're throwing away on unimportant things","As a student in Tunis, I receive 200Dt monthly for my expenses.

-Opt for a 6-bottle pack of 2-liter water instead of buying individual bottles.

18horm7,https://i.redd.it/2us2yfvg446c1.jpg,51,Save money easily,,"""Bankers hate him, for using this one cool trick to pay off all his debts, click to know""","Just clarifying some points here since I've noticed a lot of misinformation being presented as facts without much economic context. I'm neither a supporter of KS nor a Tunisian, so consider this an impartial view.

Let's start with some facts: Tunisia, pre-revolution, had a low deficit and relatively low debt at around 40%, which enabled the government to have low service costs on the debt owed to foreign creditors. Moving fast forward to the mid-2010s, the deficit increased tenfold while the debt substantially rose to reach 77% of local GDP, making it difficult for governments to meet their debt obligations. Couple that with Covid spending, and you arrive at today, where the debt crisis has reached its peak.

Then comes the global mechanism for credit ratings, where Tunisia is facing exorbitant rates for borrowing costs, being the highest in the continent at 27.5%, compared to the second-highest, Egypt, at 12%. This, I hope explains to you why it is such a challenging task to pay off those debts.

I don't believe the KS government is necessarily in the wrong when it comes to managing debt. I think they rejected IMF conditions, which isn't necessarily bad since study after study has shown that IMF austerity measures rarely have a positive impact on the economy.

Some poster below said that the debt increased, and I quote, 'The funny thing is he didn't even pay debt in the sense that everyone thinks he did. Our debt slightly increased since 2022.' It did, yes, but that's just a simplified view of economics. It actually went down even when it increased, which is a natural outcome of having a mountain of debt with a high yield to pay. I won't go deep into whatever policies have been made, but the debt went down from 79.9% in 2022 to 76% of gdp as of Sep 2023. Note that a study by the IMF in 2018 presented a best-case scenario where, if Tunisians were to impose austerity and cut all subsidies (and it didn't even account for Covid), the debt-to-GDP ratio would be at 74%, if I recall correctly. So honestly, my take is that not having austerity, being subjected to the highest borrowing cost in the continent - unfairly, in my opinion - and still almost hitting the mark is impressive.

I think 2024/5 will be a good indicator of the economic direction this government is going.

Our main issues stem from a struggling economy and weak currency, causing low salaries, like a minimum wage of 390 for a 40-hour week and 460 for a 48-hour week. To boost salaries, we should stop state subsidies on things like bread and sugar (except maybe oil, which makes a profit) but it still doesn't make sense for someone with a 300K car or living abroad to pay the same as someone with a Peugeot 206.

We also need to fix our deficit-ridden public companies. Many have more employees than necessary. We could expand their functions to make them more productive, or we might have to let go of some employees to cut costs and make profits. Another option is privatizing non-essential companies, like those producing cigarettes, which are in the red and costing the state money, by privitazing them the state will make money off taxes.

If we make our public companies profitable, the government will have more money. This could lead to reducing taxes, which I believe is a major cause of our current inflation. I'm proposing we follow a socio-democratic model like many European countries, with free education, healthcare, and public transport. Instead of subsidies for everyone, let's provide direct social aid to families in need.

But to make these changes, we need a bold leader at the helm, not a bunch of fools. It'll take time, but if we don't act now to change our economic structure, by voting to the right people we'll keep facing the same problems.

 ","Weak currency is a non issue, unstable currency is a big problem.","Firstly, your desire to lower taxes while advocating for an extensive social benefit system seems paradoxical to me. Where do you think the government will get the money for those programs? Either you support a free market or you don't; you can't selectively choose. The government's involvement in owning and supporting companies will tip the scale of competition towards the government, effectively picking winners and losers in the market.

Privatization means job losses like you said, and in this case, it will disproportionately impact the middle class. Coupled with the reduced taxation you suggest, there will be an increased demand for benefits, resulting in more debt and inflation. Your proposed economic model essentially copies that of Peronist Argentina, you can google Argentina's economy and see how that ended up working for them. 

You don't need a bold leader to get the economy back on track; this isn't the bachelor. What you need are competent ministries and low corruption. Tunisia needs to make substantial investments in education and infrastructure while working to improve public sector efficiency. Factors like transparency, reduced bureaucracy, and a well-educated workforce can serve the economy better in the short term than slashing taxes without economic planning.

Taxation is strongly linked with the fiscal planning of the country, and this is an issue that should be shared between the Ministry of Finance and legislators, not resting solely on the shoulders of a bold leader, again, the economy isn't the bachelor. Achieving fiscal stability, and guaranteeing the state's responsibility towards managing public finances effectively can lead to better credit ratings internationally, resulting in improved access to financing Tunisia's projects through debt. Improving the rule of law, private property protections, and facilitating access to arbitration are factors that will increase the ease of doing business in Tunisia, attracting foreign direct investment as a result.

Regarding subsidies, streamlining and reviewing them is something that I agree with. However, to execute this efficiently, it's crucial to consider the impact cutting them off will have. An efficient government would have conducted a census, working out the population most in need to help directly, and reducing subsidies in stages to mitigate the impact on the society. 

Finally, Tunisia has a lot going for it. However, consistently blaming the government undervalues the capabilities of the people of Tunisia. While it's true that the government plays a crucial role in shaping the economy, there is still work to be done at the local level. This includes collaborating to prevent and condemn low-level corruption, partnering with local municipalities to reduce bureaucracy, advocating for e-government, supporting local art and produce, and enhancing the local aesthetic through community beautification projects. Small investments, such as a few paint buckets, brooms, and planting pots, may not strain the budget for a small community but could significantly improve life for everyone, fostering increased economic activity in the local community. Yes, I know a colorful wall won't get you your dream job, but it symbolizes a change of culture, and that is what will get you that job eventually. 

I could write extensively on many small steps that can be taken, but the common perception people have is that change must come from above, waiting for a messiah to magically transform Tunisia, it neglects the reality that a good policy alone won't fix a bad culture. Real change starts with the people. Those words were written with love, so don't come at me with how great Tunisian culture is, I think it is.","I agree with you but I'm no quite sure where to start mainly because such changes cannot be made overnight and do require careful treatment. The reason for that is simple: People resist change. An abrupt change in policies and in the overall structure of our economic institutions could potentially lead to social issues. We all seem to know that our economic growth is in decline and  that the quality of human capital we have is insufficient to maintain an acceptable level of productivity let alone to keep up with globalization. There seem to be a lot of structural weaknesses in our political/economic institutions and there are also flaws inherent to the current work force.  I'm by no means an expert in this field, but I don't think that's an easy thing to do. I ask myself sometimes, why don't the experts take such initiatives? could it be that they're **all** deep in corruption, ignorant to the situation or is there actually something reasonable stopping them? As you have already said, we need a strong leader to simultaneously handle all of these issues. I wonder who's that gonna be.","The solution is not complicated tbh but whoever will do it will face backlash from the people, some may starve.

I know that questions about dating, especially from foreigners, can be recieved very poorly in most countries subs. I understand that.

That being said:

I'm a 28 year old male who moved to Tunis for work. I've been here for 3 months and recently started using Tinder here. 

I've matched with a lot of cool looking women, with interesting bio's. But here's the problem:

When I talk to them, all conversations seem to be the same:

I say something or ask a question, and I get a very simple reply back (sometimes just a word) and no follow up question.

 For example, where I'm from, I would ask: ""what do you do for work?"" or (if their interest is reading) ""what book are you reading now?""

And the girl will reply something like:

""I work in marketing. What about you?""

But in Tunisia, women reply ""I work in marketing"". Without a follow up question or anything. 

So where I'm from, this means the girl is not interested and is just being polite. So in my own country I would stop the conversation there. And I did that here too. But then the weird thing is, if I leave the conversation at this point in Tunisia, often a few days later I'll get a follow up question from the same girl. But then when I ask a question again, I get a monosyllabic response again and the cycle repeats a few days later. 

So what I did is I just asked on of these girls out, and we actually had a few nice dates (though that was it since she didn't live in Tunis and went back home). And in real life, this girl was fun, open and engaged the whole time. But i could never have predicted that from the way she was in Tinder!

And I really don't want to say ""all girls from Tunisia behave like this on Tinder"" but honestly... I have yet to find an exception. This makes me realize that, since I am the foreigner, I am doing something wrong and not adapting to the Tunisian tinder ways. So my question is: How is a Tinder conversation supposed to go in Tunisia? How do women like to be talked to? I'd really like your ideas!

And I hope this is not offending anybody.","it's a very simple math.

Girl has 30 minutes to spend on Tinder.

(non-Tunisian) girl engages in 10-15 minutes conversations with 2-3 best options of that day.

(Tunisian) girl throws one word to each one of the 100 guys who contacted her that day.

That's it.","When I was single I had kinda similar experiences in Tunisia (and not just with Tinder). At first the girl wouldn't seem interested at all and not ask any questions, just to come back a few days later with things like ""why did you stop talking to me???""  
Like omg, in my country you not asking me any questions would mean that you'd want me to stop talking to you haha","You will eventually get matched with someone who doesn’t behave like this. Keep looking.
Although the more attractive they are the more likely it is to go this way, i think it’s usually due to some childish entitlement.",😂 nah that’s normal behaviour from Tunisian women,"Tunisians don't take tinder too seriously, people will only use it when extremely bored or lonely, so they're looking for a stand out - out of the box starter to catch their interest. Girls get similar messages from everyone on tinder so it gets repetitive and boring which is why they reply poorly with no follow up questions.
I personally never answer questions like what do you do for work from strangers. It serves no purpose.

As for the follow up you get days later don't take it personally,as I've mentioned previously ppl here don't take tinder seriously so they don't spend much time on it.",2023-12-12 11:47:15

I've been trying to understand the marriage laws in Tunisia, and I'm a bit confused. Traditionally, Islam is known to allow polygamy and cousin marriage, not allowing Muslim women to marry non-Muslims. However, I recently learned that in Tunisia, polygamy is illegal.

I'm also curious about cousin marriage and its potential risks for birth defects or genetic issues – if anyone has information on this, I'd appreciate some insights. if you want to understand these issues better, I found a video that delves into these questions: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyNP3s5mxI8&t=14s)

Moreover, is it true that non-Muslim women in Tunisia are allowed to marry non-Muslim men? I thought there were restrictions in other Muslim-majority countries, but I've heard Tunisia has a more progressive approach.

Have there been recent changes in these laws, or am I misunderstanding something? I don't mean to be disrespectful; I just want to learn. Please, let's keep the discussion respectful and share any explanations or resources you can provide.

Thanks in advance!","1. Polygamy is banned since 1956 in Tunisia. Culturally, it's seen as retrogaded and stupid by a large part of the population

2. Cousin Mariage is legal to the 2nd degree. Used to be the norm, Nowadays isn't for a majority of the population, you can still find it in remote places

3. Interfaith couples are legal for men since 1956 and since 2019 or 2018 for women. Culturally, it depends on the level of pratice of the tunisian family: if they are not very praticing they may accept a white catholic or agnostic, or an asian Also, people in Tunisia tend to care more about the color of the skin than the religion. That's why a marriage with a black person is often disregarded unfortunately even if the person is muslim","1) polygamy is banned
2) cousin marriage isn't regulated by laws, but premarital medical consultation do warn couples about potential risks

I am an algerian indie artist. I do concept art, character and creature design and mentorship for the previous on a hobbyist or a professional level both. continuously expanding my skillset (hopefully to more content creation for educational content and more forms of media).  


I've constantly struggled with how locked of a country and unsupportive Algeria is to individual activities, especially with working with international clients and partners.  
Currently I don't even have a card that would allow me to receive pay and accessing one has not only been a struggle but also halted my professional activities as a whole.  


I would love to move abroad. but for a short term solution, I'd love to migrate to Tunisia temporarily since it's much less of a jump or a change of living climate. also Tunisia seems like a sweet place and i'd love to see and share the culture, work aside.  


This is still on the planning phase and looking for options. I'm inquiring to evaluate how viable it would  be and I'd move only once It's safe and I can smoothly integrate there.

Downtown Tunis, you can visit the old Medina city where you can explore the old Arabian city lifestyle, and try some traditional food.

Nearby, I recommend visiting la Goulette, cozy bars, good restaurants, a good Tunisian vibe.

La Marsa too.

A bit far, I'd recommend Zriba al-Olia in  Zaghouan (40 miles - 65 km) from Tunis. You can also try a traditional Hammam (natural hot baths) in Hammam Zriba which is also in Zaghouan.

Soon after, my initial reply that was sitting at 3 upvotes got downvoted to oblivion, and his reply got insta upvoted by 16 (now it's sitting at much more)

Upon checking his history, I found out that the same thing kept happening whenever he replied and started attacking someone.

Here is my comment:

>Shakshuka is Tunisian food, it is not Jewish. The reason why it's in Palestine/Israel is because:  
>  
>1- We have Jews in Djerba who travel back and forth to Israel  
>  
>2- Arabs tend to 'borrow' foods from different arab countries, and so do Palestinians (we have Shawarma and Falafel in Tunisia for example)

&#x200B;

so he replied:

>Whether you like it or not, whether you assimilate or discriminate against Jews, our 2,000 years in the diaspora is an inseparable part of our identity and culture. A Palestinian has no more right to North African food because it was colonized by Arabs than the descendants of an Israeli culture of which North African Jewry has become an inseparable part of.

&#x200B;

I wrote a [15 minute reply](https://pastebin.com/gNbyLNmD) under him explaining that we Tunisians are not racist and that I never even tried to attack anyone, but my reply got shadow banned. Every further reply got shadow banned ever since. There was even one ignorant guy claiming that Shakshuka wasn't Tunisian in his opinion, and my response to him still got shadow banned.

First of all, you should compare to 2019-2021 because 2022-2023 are Saied years and shortages did start in 2022.

Second, out of these products the one we don't produce much locally and have to import decreased (ble tendre/farina, corn, soja). So basically this indicates that we did actually cut total quantities for the ones we have to import.

The ones that increased are ones where local production is important and dropped significantly. Of course imports of milk increased but it's a very negative thing because we used to export it. The regime destroyed the milk chain of production so just because we're importing more doesn't mean we fulfilled our needs, it means our local production which was not just enough for all of Tunisia but enough to sell milk to our neighbours was fucked and the only people responsible for destroying it is Saied and co who refused to raise prices for populism and now are paying 4x to import milk.

The same thing applies to potatoes which you single out here. They arrested people for keeping potatoes in freezers so Tunisian farmers stopped producing them so we had to import. It doesn't mean the local market had enough potatoes, it just means Tunisian potatoes disappeared because of the stupid regime that scared farmers into not producing them. The fact that imports increased should be a scandal not a positive thing for the regime.

The same thing applies to wheat/ble dur. We had an absolutely horrible season with almost 0 local production so of course we're going to import more. It's not a positive thing and it doesn't mean we imported enough.

Also since you're discussing this how can you explain tea imports going to 0 and coffee imports being cut by 95% while the government claims they imported enough? It's a blatant lie so what are we even discussing here when the government itself at the same time admits to not importing when publishing numbers and then when talking they say they imported? There's no argument to be made but instead they rely on blind supporters who they know are too stupid to read numbers anyways.

Here's the balance for 2020-2021 attached. Why did we import nearly no potatoes back then but they were available when Tunisian producers weren't arrested for storing it? Why did we consistently import over 1100kT in ble tendre/farina back then but only in 2023 we imported 975kT and suddenly there's shortages? Why did Tunisia import less milk back then but milk was more than available and now it isn't (hint: it's because local production was destroyed by Saied)?

18ev2zo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/18ev2zo/tunisias_chronically_high_npl_ratio_and_its/,7,Tunisia's Chronically High NPL Ratio And Its Effect On The Local Economy,"NPL stands for non-performing loan, and it is given that label when the borrower ceases to make monthly payments on the loan or its interest. Typically, a loan earns this designation after several months of non-repayment by the borrower. The NPL ratio is measured to assess the credit risk in the banking sector and the quality of outstanding loans in the economy. A higher ratio indicates significant risk in the banking sector, potentially leading to losses. This is usually symptomatic of a struggling economy.

NPLs are detrimental to banks as they can result in great losses, impacting the banks' performance and their ability to extend loans to businesses and retail customers. Economy also will feel the burnt of that. 

Here are the NPL ratios of some countries for comparison: Saudi Arabia 1.7%, Morocco 8.8%, Jordan 4.5%, Egypt 3.5%, Algeria 20.3%, Peru 3.7%, Chile 2%, Turkey 1.5%, and Tunisia 11%.

Typically, a ratio above 5% signals trouble. Although Tunisia's ratio is at 11%, it is the lowest in decades, having reached almost 20% under Ben Ali and hovered around 15% in the past decade. The current Central Bank has implemented a policy requiring all banks to reduce their NPL ratios to below 7% by 2026. 

Even before this policy, banks were forced to raise interest rates on lending to compensate for the elevated risk resulting from the high percentage NPLs in their assets, tightening loan access as a result. While this policy is sound, it will pose additional challenges for the average customer in the upcoming years regarding borrowing, up until 2026 at least. 

Research indicates that a high NPL ratio causes the economy to lose 2% of growth annually. The current policy of gradually lowering the ratio is expected to benefit the economy in the long term. However, a more effective solution would involve the government acquiring these bad loans through public asset management company and working to resolve them. This approach would allow the banking sector to recover more rapidly, fostering a quicker economic growth. Unfortunately, I give in that the government lacks the resources to implement such a solution at the moment. 

While reducing the NPL ratio might not serve as a magical solution for the Tunisian economy, as evidenced by Egypt, it will result with a much-needed growth. It's also a step is in the right direction for improving Tunisia's fiscal health.","Imo think our government is big enough. Having the government to subsidy NPLs would only make it bigger and worse. Our state owned companies have proven to be a complete disaster (except for some).

But this is my personal opinion and I'm not an expert so I'm open to more educated people on the matter.",how would this get changed with the latest interest payment information release by the goverment ? is this before of after those numbers got released ?,,,,2023-12-10 04:05:28

I have achieved a fit body, I'm working on my future, I regulated porn to once per week.

That's all side quests being worked on, just need patience.

My big problem is personality, sociability, communication, making relationships, any type of relations. Whatever you want ""it"" called. forming connections with other people basically.

I'm 20 and I figured out that's all i want really. Every other objective (or sidequest heh) I had/have is out of insecurity while this is the one and only thing I truly want. Absolutely nothing else forreal.

I go school, everybody just wants me to help them out with something, just 3bed ta3 masale7.

I go outside, hitting convos with randoms is easy, all you gotta do is find something you both would like to complain about, I pretty can't swing the convo any other way with randos.

I go gym, I despise talking there, the little bit of focus I have despite the loud shitty music gets drained if I talk so I just stick by myself. NOT willing to talk here besides salem salem 9adeh mezelk mn serie with the occasional convo once a month or two.

other than necessary objectives like a career or health, my goals in life are pretty minuscule: get friends, friends to share going to concerts, the beach, drink with, get invited to parties, get a gf, dates, cinema, someone to spoil, fucking, cuddling.

As for the socializing part, the best way to get better at it(at least in my opinion) is to join charity organisations / clubs , especially within your uni. If you're not a student, you can join croissant rouge.

a lot of people do recommend charities and organisations that do work with other people. i would also reocmmend seeing how to get in a more business relationship with porn and social media. if your case is not a mental dissorder, which i think it isn't, getting into the porn and/or social media business (not that they do intersect mcuh) would let you see them as they really are, and will help you transition from the hold they might have on you. 

But with more honesty, there is something called ""growing up"" and ""doing what you think suits you/is right"", if youa re still in your 20s, you have a high chance of getting over those mental blocks just by giving yourself some leway (if that's the correct word).   
you know, it's totally fine to have friends and have porn and social media related issues at the same time, there is no real rules when it comes to people's compositions.","Consult a shrink, it can be helpful",You think hitting the gym will fix ur life?,2023-12-09 22:00:27

They will work HARD, day and night to get there. It also helps that most of those who get to legally immigrate are of a certain background (highly educated, hungry for sucess, money and power ...).

That being said, being a neet is fun ... for a while ... when you are still in your early 20's. Maybe you can push it until you are into your mid 20's. After that, the party is over.

It gets you a breather from the ""rat race"".Two years is a bit too much, if you are not trying anything to move on with your life. Three is just ... Nope.

Right now, I'm struggling to memorize a lot of word. It's frustrating because I used to memorize many words to understand Arabic for exams when I was a kid, but it didn't work and now I hate it. Most students in my school struggle with French and English, while they understand Arabic well. Unfortunately, I am not allowed to choose the language i study.

I get annoyed when adults are telling me not to fail in Arabic (+ philosophy + history + geography) exams. Why can't I remove them? They are the least important in the computer science section, which I chose. I attend Arabic class every Monday and Thursday for two hours each week. However, I only have English class on Tuesdays for two hours and only French class on Wednesdays for two hours instead of having two classes in either English or French.

At the end of the road you have goals to graduate and move to the next step,

You can not change the rules of the game, but you can definitely choose how much to be affected by the rules that do not make sense to you. 

Student life is hard in a sense that there is a very limited effort and time to study while there is a lot of distractions. 

A lot of students get hampered in their results not because of their intelligence but because of their ability to stay balanced, stay engaged, stay focused and to manage their emotional state. 

I was a moody student, i discarded many subjects due to teachers or disinterest, this did create more stress as it created more pressure on other subjects. 

This also left me unprepared for future life challenges where i needed to take actions on things that i was not good at and or did not feel like doing. 

Eventually everyone graduated but i had a lot of inbalance in my work/life style as i would end up getting impacted in my personal life due to my difficulties to get things done. 


I dont know your current situation with enough detail, My recommendation to my past myself is to put effort in finding a balance that would allow me to manage my emotions and to find a sustainable and organised way of dealing with studies and other areas of life, that and to take some hobbies that challenge those weaknesses of mine.

Whatever you decide to spend effort on now, however pointless, ineffective, uncomfortable, boring or silly it feels, no effort is really lost, it's just that some effort will bring fruits much later in life, it's just hard to see in the beginning and easy to see later. 

Whatever happens now is temporary, and More and more silly and illogical challenges are awaiting students after studies, in the end, none of them are worth our frustrations, or worth stressing about, and getting them done makes a resilient person ready for life lemons.","This might be an unpopular opinion but those subjects are important.
Let us start with Arabic and with facts: every language you learn improves your neuroplasticity and your cognitive skills in general. Moreover, if you aim to study CS, you will see the advantages it will give you to master a completely different language when you come to the subjects of computer linguistics and theoretical computer science. 

Philosophy is another subject you’ll come to be grateful for as a CS student, if you pay good attention in secondary school. Philosophy, maths and CS are very closely connected and if the curriculum is somehow still the same as 30+ years ago you will learn a lot about logic, linguistics (again) and language as a vehicle for thought. 

Now, you might not need history and geography for CS but they will help you be a better person, that can understand the world you live in and how you should walk through life. Ibn Khaldun realized over 600 years ago that civilizations lived in cycles and it’s important to learn those patterns and their triggers and rationales in history and geography (beyond the regurgitation of facts and figures)

If you would take the advice of a much older computer scientist, I would recommend you try to understand why you are experiencing difficulties with Arabic if you are able to excel in other languages and take it from there.",2023-12-09 19:06:42

ofc,  you'll move to the next step if the current was successful

So the hr interview, generally it's an exchange about your personal infos, education, hobbies, experiences, achievements and ofc you'll be asked the standard questions (like ""why should we hire you?"")

In the tech interview, you will be asked for every technical thing you put on your resume and discuss about your IT experiences and maybe get some problem solving tasks.

""Tunisian intelligence and uniqueness"" is a concept infused by Bourguiba at the time he was building a young nation.

Also, for a country with almost no natural resources, your only bet is to tell people they are unique to get the best of them. 
Since then, the myth was perpetuated and gradually taken for granted. The random Tunisian has pride, which is good but where things go wong is when you're disconnected from the world and still live with old myths. It's may be a kinda escaping reality. 
Tunisians are among the citizens that travel the less, of course that green passport has a lot to do with this, and  if they did, they will discover that we're average people, we're not that smart and we're not that brillant as we think. Saw a lot of us mocking others, while we have absolutely no idea about them.

Tnajem taaml licence then you apply for an engineering school (à condition que les relevées de notes ykounou gonflés), ama les places disponibles par école ykounou limitées aalekher and there's no guarantee that you'd get accepted.

&#x200B;

Pros:

* You learn to be rigorous.
* You get used to mathematical notation and concepts, meaning that you won't find much trouble if you want to get yourself into a career that requires mathematical modeling.

Cons:

* Focuses too much on theoretical stuff.
* Intense schedule.
* Usually undermines extracurricular activities.
* Can sometimes be stressful.

Hi,

I wanted to learn a dialect but couldn't find any massive dictionnary or courses where i could learn a lot of words.

I found and loved the [https://derja.ninja/](https://derja.ninja/)  website, so I made a script to get (in order) the top 20.000 english  words. I found 11.300 word and their translation, + 0 to 3 sample  sentences, and the audio with it.

This is not perfect, as some pretty common words weren't found (like ""i"",""am"",""want"" ...

The deck is available on the Anki platform for free [https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1875413457](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1875413457)

The cards look like this

Do you really think that 50+ countries with no economic integration whether in terms of regulations, infrastructure, development or even fiscally suddenly will have smooth trading? Not to mention unstable political status many countries in the continent have. You will have countries dumping their cheap products onto other countries, farmers losing their livelihood simply because they can't compete with more developed farmers who can scale up their productions, you will have countries falling into debt simply to finance infrastructure to be able to conduct this free trade, you will have local industries decimated because they can no longer compete in open market, or simply when labor gets costly they will relocate their factory elsewhere to cheapest available market and this in a region struggling to retain industrial output, you will have multinational corporations strong arming the continent into bad agreements in order to enable them to exploit as many as possible. Not to mention the environmental issues, the severe corruption, and the lack of fair and common framework for arbitrage, which will lead to stronger countries abusing the agreement and impoverishing weaker ones further.

Please though, be considerate when it comes to numbers / currency. The currency of our country is the dinar (TND) not millime. It is thus not 14 milyar but 14 malyoun TND.

To put things in perspective, 14 million TND is equivalent to \~4.6 million USD. This means that on average, each of the 140 people is required to pay \~ 32.000 USD (\~ 100.000 tnd or 100 malyoun franc).

Don’t let numbers fool you, the total amount (14 malyoun dinar) is really inconsequential. It is barely enough to pay the salaries of **8.000** cops or **10.000** teachers for a month.

I'll try to be brief. I've had a military higher education in a very niche speciality. There's only 348 of us active and in duty right now. Everything about my work and trainiijng has been tailored to keeps us in Tunisia (naturally underpaid like everyone is, and without much room for growth) 

So at age 35, I feel like a cog in a rusty machine. Unable to do much to help change things and living under my projected aspirations. 

Recently I landed a contract, like a big one, abroad. I'm not hesitant about it. I've filed for technical cooperation where I'll be paying some 15% of my annual revenue to the Tunisian pension scheme (cnrps). 

However my management is making this difficult, if not impossible, and they risk me missing my contract. I'm seriously thinking that I should leave and let them do what they will. I'm leaving yes, but I want it to be on good terms and in a way that'll allow me to help myself and family without hassle. Any advice is welcome.","Hi there! The Tunisian administration is so stubborn and short sighted, they don't see the benefit of what you are trying to do.  
My sister went through the same, she landed a very good contract abroad as a doctor, she wanted to go through cooperation process, but her bosses made it so difficult and complicated, she was gonna miss the whole thing, so she just left with a very short notice and did not wait for their approval. She did that because she knew that she can't face any legal charges. You on the contrary are in the military, which can be different legally, so check what are the risks if you decide to leave anyways. Check if you can quit your job (knowing that you probably can't come back) and screw the good terms, if they stand in your way t achieve your goals, walk over them","are you a pilote ?

because only 382 and from the military in tunisia only the military train to be a pilote or you gonna need barcha flous","First step is to leave, next is to deal with whatever your institution has with you, but from abroad, you cant risk losing what you have for morals or ethics.

Tunisia is just one good government away from a better future. 

You have low external debts (Yes, I know), but it's still low compared to others.

Think of this as just some crazy rambles by me, but these are achievable steps that need to be taken for Tunisia to break free from its misery:

* Strengthen state institutions, regardless of whether they are democratic or autocratic. Shift to e-government to reduce corruption involving middlemen.

* Gain a firm grip on state finances. Even if there's a deficit, a strong grip is a must.

* Improve the rule of law, increase policing, and enhance safety.

Once you achieve all of the above, you can move to stage 2:

* Get massively in debt, but for good reasons such as investing in new infrastructure (airports, roads, trains, water, and energy), establishing new industry and technology parks, renovating and making cities more appealing for high-end tourism and, of course, their own residents, education and health. 

* Create business-friendly laws because investors will be eager to invest in Tunisia if you reach this point.

* Gradually embrace a free market and reduce existing protections on pricing as the debt rises. This will be eased by the economic growth resulting from the debt.

Not even my own plan lol, it's been done over and over again by every single developed country.","Tunisia is a hole in the time/place continuum, controlled by a number of big filthy rich families, where everything you see or experience is designed with the purpose of either confusing, or distracting you.

- finish your frist contract and get paid

- use your upwork account to create a payoneer account and link it with your real bank account (no hiding anything, it's all legal)

- use your Id to verify your payoneer account

- use upwork to fund your account regularly and try to get to more than 10k inflow to get the reduced fees

Because the person does not have to be Tunisian and/or living in Tunisia but he has to do with Tunisia. He can be a Tunisian but living abroad. Or maybe a person who will have a huge effect on Tunisia for example durring that year. But then again, we all know that the person will be 99.9% of the times Tunisian. The declaration of the winner will be on the 6th of December every year. This year's (2023) person of the year is Belgacem. 

The motivation is the following ""through his contribution to the Reddit community of Tunisia and with his multiple accounts on the site, Belgacem got many Tunisian teenagers and young adults to look at the world differently. He made countless people believe in themselves and  retrieve hope in the future. Belgacem knows everything and he is constantly teaching others the art of life and there are no people on Earth he was so determined to help like his own countrymen"". 

Well, let us see who wins the Belgacem Person of the Year award in 2024. Results will be published on 2024/12/06

It depends on your interests, but a good starting point is discovering what people your age do and where they go. From there, you can choose a path that resonates with you.

If you have difficulties communicating with others or you're overly shy, you've got to work on that first. As social creatures, initiating connections with new people often leads to introductions to others, expanding your circle of friends.

Small cheese factories aren't even finding milk to buy and a lot of farmers want to sell the liter for over 2k. They should have taxed products like yogurts which are always present even though there's a shortage in milk. I can't believe 1kg of Edame increased by average 10 dinars..  


They are forcing artisanal products to go extinct (not only cheese) and are pushing the crappily manufactured by big companies (Hi delice danone) products, I wouldn't even be surprised that it was pushed by a lobby to make big companies get more profit. I wish milk was even of good quality, the quality of milk we have in Tunisia compared to other countries is really bad and just filled with water. The milk that we all buy ""demi"" is basically just water and only has 20-30% cream while the milk that the average citizens buys in other countries is with full cream.",Fuck them and go buy contraband dutch masdam gruyere from marché central b 3400/100gr,Worst and worst every day and BTW they are not allowing  cheese  importation as well.,2023-12-05 19:39:26

They still have costs and some of those are higher in Tunisia like import taxes (60% in Tunisia) and even shipping costs. It's not necessarily that they want to be a luxury brand based on Tunisia's avg purchase power, it's the government that wants these to be luxury items so most people can't buy them and they import less.

A side-effect of this policy is there's also less competition in Tunisia because not many brands want to deal with Tunisia's bureaucracy/import tariffs/small market/unpredictability...etc so they get to raise their prices even more","That's true. 

Abroad such brands are aimed at middle income consumers that wanna look trendy and therefore they're not items made to last or of superior quality.

Once you ship these items here, plus taxes plus a trendy location's rent etc they'll end up being pricey and honestly not worth the cost anymore.

I'd imagine the consumers buying these items are either naive tourists or people that just want to buy branded clothes; similar to those that go to Starbucks for a coffee when you can get a way better coffee at a fraction of the cost elsewhere.",i just buy used,Chouf fripe w zid 5ayet 3and l5ayata echti 9mech li t7eb 3lih ...,2023-12-04 20:27:05

- Do not ""tod5el byeddek w sa9ik fi matahet idara""   so, never do the law / legal process by yourself. find a good lawyer  / law experts, then, let him do the administrative papers for you.   ( this step may cost you money, but, trust me its better than do the legal work by yourself. )
because if you start by yourself, you will hate yourself.

- Try to find an international brand to work with, even if its not a very know brand. if you can find a business man / international brand who can work with you, the local market will be happy to work with you. also, the process to get a permit from the gouvernment will be easier.

-  Do not start big !   if they find that your project is profitable, the ""big fishs"" will do everything to make you loose & abandant your project.  so, when start your legal process & administrative papers, let the know that you will only sell you product on your city / the few cities near your cities.  let your ambitions low. after you get your permits / licences, then, F**K them & sell your products everywhere you can.  the difficult step is to get permits, so, try hard to get it.

- Never invest all your money in the project.  make sure that you have the possibility to move outside the country when they cause you problems.","My advice hire a professional to get this kind information and guide you through the process (lawyer + expert comptable).

I would do the same for the wine making, wine making although not necessarily difficult remain an art. So you probably want to hire a professional winemaker as well to help you set up production and guide you through the process the first couple of years. Although Spanish and Italian wine making consultants are very good they tend to be expensive, so don't hesitate to hire an Argentinian, Chilean or South-african.

Good luck, can't wait to drink your wines.","U probably wanna start with a market research because I don’t think , Tunisians are ur target.
I m not actually surprised when u said u did not find anything on the internet because if there is anything in the laws about this or any other field for that matter , they just throw u a pdf and expect u to read the whole 200 page pdf(if u find something that is ). 
About consultants , i assume u know a winery in Tunisia (or any competitor ) if not , I don’t think u would want a consultant that never touched this kinda work before. Ur best bet is to actually talk to restaurant/bar about this because they are ur constant and reliable clients. 
Other than all of this xD , in Tunisia , it is so hard to get a permit to sell any kind of alcoholic beverages let alone manufacture em 😂 .
Last but not least , if u can or are open to , u might wanna forget about winery business as a whole in Tunisia and do another kind of project that people need or do it in another country . It is just too risky and expensive. 
This is not a financial advice , but just keep it in mind while u go through the whole thing.

I was wondering if anyone has been there recently and can advise me on how safe/unsafe it actually is? It’s often better to hear from people who actually live in the area on what’s the best option. Thanks!",Totally safe like always don't go to villages near Libya's border thats it only those one little bit unsafe due to the state of libya obv,"safest place

Keep your ID with you in both cases.

After paying everything keep the receipt with you. If you drive around with that alcohol you need to show the receipt to show you bought it legally, if of course, needed. It's rare tho but good to keep in mind. 

Other than that everything goes normally.",It's the same process as any other kind of groceries,"No, you just go in and buy",hahaha my first time I was nervous as shit and I was a minor too. I kept stumbling on my words and dropping shit like my wallet because of how nervous I was I was the most suspicious and obvious minor on the planet. then the cashier just scanned it and I left home lol. everything is normal and no ones cares basically. just bring your ID,"They might ask you for your ID, so have it ready just in case.

there is also   [**William Spaniel**](https://www.youtube.com/@Gametheory101)  who does videos on similar topics but in a different style (we call this one ""lines on maps"" guy, because it's something he uses to explain risk and reward in politics and militairy)

[**Binkov's Battlegrounds**](https://www.youtube.com/@Binkov) is another good one for militairy enthusiasts, he publishes news about the armament industry (new tanks, ships, planes), and occasionnaly does hypothetical battle scenarios, which are really fun

نهار  الثلاثاء ٢٠ سبتمبر ٢٠٠٥، انا مانيش في تونس اما لبرّة في افريقيا جنوب الصحراء 

في البانكا، بعدما علمتهم قبل بنهار الي باش نجيهم من غدوة للجبدان، اما قبل ما ندخل وانا في الباركينغ نركّح في الكرهبة جاني واحد متع الباركينغ وقالي حويجة، الفين فرنك، قلتلو  مافوقيش توّة، اما تو نقرالك حسابك في الرجوع كي العادة، وقتها يضهرلي يعمل العشرة متع الصباح 

سكت وضحك وقالي باهي 

دخلت للبانكا، وما خرجت الا بعد نص النهار منها اما جبدت فلوسي. جاو من البنك المركزي متاعهم في كميونة وجابولي فلوسي زوز افارقة جيش بمكاحل عيار ثقيل وصندوق قد الماهي كيما متع القراصنة اما حديد

وكي حسبت الفلوس من بعد نلقاهم ناقصين ورقة وحدة    من لفّة، يعني ٥٠ دينار طلعو هزوهم او الماكينة

I use vichy dercos antidandruff which deletes the existence of dandruff, but makes my hair looks super frizzy and horrible . I use for about a month, twice a week.

I then go back to using ketozol once or twice a week. ketozol is nowhere near as good as dercos for dandruff but it doesn't ruin the look of my hair so badly like dercos does, but hair still looks bad.

I opt for ketozol when I'm not using dercos because it's much cheaper.

Meanwhile I go to the gym about 4 to 5 times a week and everytime I use a shampoo that, for a while, made my hair look great.

While anti-dandruff shampoo (badly) straightens my hair, this one makes my hair look great and gives it curls for some reason. before this shampoo I only ever had curls when my hair is wet. It's this version of [cytolcap](https://pharma-shop.tn/19155-large_default/cytol-cytolcap-f-shampooing-fortifiant-revitalisant-200ml.webp). It let curls stay while my hair is dry and it was the best my hair looked ever in my life.

After the last round of using dercos (stopped about a month ago), Cytolcap does not make my hair look great anymore. If I can make cytolcap make my hair look great again, how please?

I personally believe sulfate is the bane of my existence since cheap shampoo like syoss ruins my hair and even cheaper ones just the same. But for some reason the red version of cytolcap made my hair look great while there's no mention that it doesn't have sulfate. I assume the sellers always mention the no sulfate thing because buyers, like me, gobble that shit up.

&#x200B;

This [picture](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/58F83WaMR7g/maxresdefault.jpg) of this dude wanting his hair to go from left to right.

My hair is like the right version, awful and frizzy. the red version of my shampoo calms down the hair and makes it look the left version more, which in my case, is better looking.

189da79,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/189da79/opportunity_vs_topic_pfe/,2,Opportunity vs Topic [PFE],"To provide context, I am currently in the final year of my engineering studies and am required to undertake a 4-6 month internship as my graduation project(PFE). My interest lies in the applications of AI, specifically in robotics, computer vision, and other engineering fields. Fortunately, I have secured a position in a world class institute. However, the proposed internship topic focuses on AI in Intrusion Detection systems, which does not interest me that much.

Upon researching the field, I've discovered that it is quite mature, and the internship would be pure research. Now, I find myself at a crossroads, debating whether to accept the offer and leverage the institute's network and resources (along with excellent living conditions) or to explore other opportunities. Unfortunately, securing a position in another prestigious institute seems unlikely, and my alternatives might involve local companies (which may be outdated) or universities abroad. 

Any advice or insights on this matter would be greatly appreciated.","You're asking us to decide instead of you, whereas I think you know very well the answer, follow what you really want and if better living conditions and opportunities will give you comfort working on something you are not interested in, go for it, keep on your mind every path you will take, you will have to prioritize some things over others.",if you’re unsure about it bcs its research don’t be i personally am not in the ai field but at first i thought research sucked but it turned out to be not too bad tbh i thought itd be hell it could open new opportunities,"Well, based on how you're putting it, you're leaning more toward the first option. You mentioned you are unlikely to land a similar opportunity with a good company. Scarcity creates value.

I'd recommend you seek the possibility of suggesting your own topic with the company if possible. You can contact the interviewers or potential managers via LinkedIn or HR people via email/Linkedin. Meanwhile, keep looking for more opportunities.

*Try to take your chances with option one before going to option two.*

**Possible case scenarios:**

\- you accept their current offer --> probably unsatisfied

\- you suggest sm topic --> they like it ---> you join them --> satisfied

\- you suggest sm topic --> they refuse --> you join them --> probably unsatisfied

\-You decline their offer. --> Join a local company. --> Uncertain.

the outcomes are based on your post; you might like the research thingy, who knows xdd

Good luck and keep us posteddd!

And people here have strong opinions that they can actually back up unlike the majority of tunisians(I'm not discounting educated ones,I've had people tell me some stuff is haram because it's against the social norm even though imams would beg to differ)


So how do you do research(subreddits/websites/Forums/neutral youtube video essays etc)?","YouTube, X, Google 1 page, Yandex 1 page, Google Scholar, Reddit, My imaginary friends..

https://preview.redd.it/qesik4vhnx3c1.jpeg?width=990&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f1948b601e36392227d49f2094ab686148abbe06","whatr are you searching for

searching for thing is one of my hobies","When you search for Islamic topics then I would suggest finding few imams that you like to listen to. Then it becomes easier to seek more knowledge about an Islamic topic when you already like the imam or a few imams. Beware of sources. Double check them and see if they are legit. Some imams throw around with sources and sometimes you find that the source they quoted, is either not that applicable to what they said, cause the context is a different one or the source is not as authentic.
Now Quranic verses are easy to fact check. With hadith and sunnah you gotta check if the source comes from an authentic background. There is a list with authentic books for hadith and sunnah.

With researching random topics it depends how well you wanna know them. When you write an academic paper then you need scientific term papers. They have to quote everything they claim with a legitimate source to back it up. Specialist literature is also very important for that. You find tons of informations and sources on the specific topic. You can find those in libraries (or digital libraries) and or on Google scholar.
You can also watch a documentary on any streaming platform or on YouTube, same with educational videos when you wanna ease into the topic first. They also provide you usually with sources to fall into a rabbit hole of more informations.

You can even start with Wikipedia. Read a little bit into it but focus on the sources.","it really depends on what you want to research, butthere are some general rules.

the first, and probably the most important rule : **NEVER BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU SEE ON THE INTERNET.**

the vast majority of content on the internet is propaganda and false news. this is something you need to drill into your head. if someone makes a claim, don't believe it unless they have a source, and then check that source as well, and what source it is using. there were many times when someone on reddit made a claim with a link to a news article or blog post, which turned out to have a clickbait title making it look like they agree with the point said redditor was making, only to say the opposite in the actual body of the article.  
there were also many cases where someone post a reference, that i then found out to be fake when i tried checking their validity.

for instance, and this is something a lot of facebook pages in particular like to do, but they make some claim or try to present some neat information and they put the infamous ""studies have revealed"". if you found something like this and no links to said ""studies"", then it's safe to assume it's a lie.

when it comes to proper sources, Wikipidea **IS NOT A VALID SOURCE BY DEFAULT.** the good thing is that they reference their sources in the bottom of the page, in the section named ""references"". you can check all the sources there to make sure what you are reading is legit.

for things that have a scientific nature, you use specifically Google Scholar, not the regular google search engine. the regular search engine will mostly take you to blogs and news papers, 80% of which are full with mis-information.   
Google scholar is a bit harder to use, since it only shows published research papers (you need to pay to access a lot of them, but there are some websites that allow you to crack them), and reading research papers is not exactly as entertaining, and takes a lot of brain power, but it's better to get a proper idea once you get used to it.

oh and, you can't trust all research papers either. they have to be peer reviewed. and for those with a medical nature, you need to have a good understanding of advanced concepts in probability and statistics, that way you can double-check the data and they way they handled it. if you choose something science related for university, you will learn a lot about those staistics and probability (the subject most people fail in uni)  
case in point, the research paper that started the whole ""vaccins cause autism"" rumor was not peer reviewed, clearly stated in the discussion that there was no clear correlation between vaccines and autism, and within 5 minutes of reading it, i found some really bad methodology and statistical mistakes, and i'm no scientist. simply from doing a single research project (analysis of the nutrition of kids with iron deficiency anemia in bousalem), i learned how to spot such mistakes.

last thing is something i suggested to another tunisian redditor today, and that is to learn about **Bias in research**, for instance cognitive bias, since by understanding how bias works, you can learn how to see things in a more objective manner. you should also learn about the **dunning-kruger effect (**a type of cognitive bias that makes people with no knowledge over-estimate what they actually know**)**, keeping this in mind is usually a good reminder that we humans really know nothing in the grand scheme of things, and should always take things slow and learn more before making a conclusion",I am 18 bac snee zeda.  Ive been through this but I had this crisis much earlier tho lol.  I had this at 13. Is God real ? Is it true that there is a creator ? What if all of this was bulshit ? Or maybe there is a god but its not the god an worshiping in Islam maybe its the god of Christianity or even Hinduism lmao naybe god is in the form of a cow ! . Everything is possible. So I started to search for the values of each religion waht do they believe in exactly what are they rules and values. And what are the evidence they use to prove and back up their religion with too ! I read all of them including Islam and including atheism what are the evidence that prove there is no god and we're just here .... . After reading them all i found that the possibility of existence of god is more convincing than the one of monkeys or the one of mitochondia . But which god now ? Alright I believe that there is a higher power but which god?   Which one is the true god ? I kept learning about all the main religions and then realised that only  Judaism and Islam convinced me . They are logical . And have evidences scientifical ones . There is so much science facts in quran how in hell did a book from 1400 years ago have these amounts of facts . That came from a person that can't read or write his name in his mother language . He was illiterate and that's a historical facts . How ? Only one person can know this much when science wasn't this advanced only one person the person who knows that because they simply created all of this . So now it's between Judaism and Islam even tho my family is Muslim and I am born as Muslim too . Which one ? They're both logical but how can Judaism be the only true religion when the Holy book of Islam knows this much of secrets . Well it can be because Islam is the continuity of Judaism.  I found science I believed in science . And science convinced of Islam.  That's why am now Muslim . The scientific evidences in quran are on another level .,2023-12-02 19:03:28

&#x200B;

Tunisia is ranked 9th in Africa, Algeria scored only slightly ahead of us while Egypt seems to be having a great time with its tech industry, even if we take it by population size, Egypt is ahead of us!

With its 15% unemployment rate, and political and economic instability, what would Tunisians do if they had better opportunities? Imagine the future ahead of us if we had good policies regarding our economy. Tunisia holds the chance to be the tech hub of Africa and the Mediterranean, but the question remains: why the fuck are we in this miserable situation?","This is as good as it seems to you. The stat that you are bringing here is showcasing no more than the fact that:

Tunisia is the 2nd country worldwide producing enginners to the total population. Investors and Multinational Corporations (espacially French) are exploiting that factor in addition to the low salaries compared to the expertise cost, espacially in IT.

A better statistics that I would be happy to see is the Number of Funds and Investments for Tunisian Startup and Companies which directly contribute to the arise of our country's GDP.","This is not a win, Vc's allocate budget per countries to spend, and in Tunisia they barely find projects to invest in","As someone form the western part of Africa, be thankful this waay better","No matter how you slice it, MENA region (including Tunisia) is in a very bad situation with a funding shortage hitting the tens of billions of dollars mark for the next decade. The money that did come in recent years mostly went to copycat startups mimicking the successes of services providers like Careem or Fintech (e-wallets, savings, investment). Worth noting is that even in politically and financially stable countries like the Gulf nations, funding is still low percentage-wise compared developed nations with startup hubs. Truth is only a handful of startups in the region make it to IPO status, and few as well manage to get acquired. 

Tunisia's got its own set of issues. Sure, political stability would be nice, but it won't magically bring in billions for tech funding. That's just wishful thinking. VC money wants teams that are tech solid, experienced in business, and that their model manages to create those sweet large revenue streams before they commit a single dollar in funding. Risk taking venture investors in MENA are mythical creatures, they don't exist. Couple that with Tunisia's limited market, and securing funding will always be a nightmare to go through. 

But here's the silver lining, there's a stash of cash in the MENA region. Tunisia needs a total makeover for its business education, like, a national emergency level investment. Because Tunisia just as every place in MENA lacks founders who know their stuff, can scale up, and come up with a profitable business model that actually works. It's not just about having a great idea; you gotta know how to turn it into a money-making machine. Tunisia also needs to spend a lot on deep tech R&D. Invest big in uni research labs. Lastly, when it comes to digital services and publishing, Tunisia's got a great advantage, the MENA region itself. We're talking a massive shared media market with a common language. The whole region's starving for fresh alternative cultural digital spaces: blogs, websites, services, you name it. Those digital spaces can also improve Tunisia's image as a rising tech hub enabling it to attract funding for the other tech areas. 

Picture this: an investor looking at a local outlet with a few hundred thousand users versus one aiming for the regional market with tens of millions of users across the MENA region. Who do you think they will fund or seek to acquire?",2023-12-02 16:39:18

Thank you !","If you already struggled socially in Tunisia, don't come here unless you're a HUGE introvert or in love with the German culture. Finding a fucking wife here is easier than finding a cool friend (speaking from experience).

Food and weather really sucks here in my opinion, but many may not care about that.

If you're bac math, uni will not be extremely hard here. Science education in Tunisia deserves much more credit. Jobs after unis are fairly easy to find, work is chill too.

I wouldn't recommend it but I also don't care about all the modern opportunities such as cinemas, concerts or modern present here. I pretty much just care about work, nature, food and social life, 3 of those are much better in Tunisia. Germany is just very very boring, you wouldn't believe what people here unironically discuss, it's so fucking boring like holy shit...","Listen, studying in Germany is a very unique experience. For it to be worthwhile you need to put in the effort for mingling into groups and societies. Understand how the whole system works and keep in mind to enjoy the whole process. Studying at university in general should be a memorable experience and as much as studying is important building your future correctly in a well community is also important.

I can help you understand everything you want about studying in Germany in all detail. Let me know if you need further help!","Generally yes, I would recommend it.

I'm 27F and I know it's embarrassing but I've never been to a nightclub/bar or had a drink with friends before. I'm an introvert and almost always studying/working and I do love my job and the career I've built for myself but I feel like I've wasted most of my 20s already and I don't want to be boring anymore. Any advice on where to go? How to act? What to expect? I know reinventing myself takes more than going to a bar and having fun in public but I want this to be a start. (Please don't be mean and thanks)","There's nothing even remotely embarrassing about this, you don't have to live with anyone's standards","I'll try to give you the same advices i gave to my little sister when she wanted to go to a bar with her friends: 

Start by planning based on your music taste. 

Try to go to an event in a barwhere a genre you like is played (that pay a fee at the door filters A LOT!)

When you go there just stick to your friend or crew and have fun with them, dance, discuss, drink or try new drinks whatever 

Don't feel ashamed or shy when you're drinking, remember that's why people go there, to drink.

Avoid taking drugs!

Avoid liquors for the first time, stick with beer or wine with food

Drink water 

Avoid talking to much older guys, people who are flexing wealth in a space supposed to celebrate music

If a stranger touches you when he's trying to tell you something WALK AWAY.

If a stranger smiles at you from a distance and kept with doing their shit without approaching you for more than an hour, they're most likely decent and you can make your move if you like them back.

Avoid dancing with strangers (many people will disagree with me but better safe than sorry) 

Drink water

Have fun chebeb!","Its not being boring or being out of touch when you dont go to bars. Its called being a normal person and making wise decisions, yeah you might have some fun there but the drawbacks far outweigh the benefits","There's nothing embarrassing about not having been to a nightclub before. People are different and everyone takes their own path and life choices. Grab a friend, hit up a chill bar, check the vibes and maybe explore a few places until you discover the atmosphere that resonates with you.","Hey there 

While this story is quite relatable There are 2 common myths in it

""I wasted my 20s"" 
Most people think they wasted their 20s, it's a matter of perception and comparing. 
Nothing is really wasted, 

""I am boring"" 
Everyone has a unique story and have little idea how much people would be interested to hear about it. 


I grew up identifying as introvert, anti social and boring,
I had tons of anxiety, a lot of self consciousness and self esteem issues. 
Somehow now i am very proud of those ""lost years"" and that ""boring nature""

That's strange, because i didn't appreciate them before, in fact i didn't appreciate myself before either. 


Now I don't know you or your situation, but i can tell you, i put a challenge to myself to meet a 100 people to go out to these uncomfortable places... 

I think talking to other people about these subjects made me realize:

1) feelings that life is wasted and feeling boring are .... feelings,  feelings are powerful but they are not truthful to the whole story,  they are truthful to the eye of the observer. 
just like wearing dark glasses and seeing everything in dark does not mean it is 

2) most people experience those feelings, even the ones who we see as did it correctly or look interesting

3) talking to people about these currently ""embarrassing"" topics is one of the most liberating things one can do,

4) even more liberation is in self compassion, and self acceptance, you do not need to be more ""interesting"" to accept yourself, it's kind of the other way around

5) whatever embarrassing or uncomfortable activity you take, you are going to be oke,",2023-12-01 22:56:23

Short story long , we used to have 6 cats one of them died like 3 months ago ""we didn't know why back then "", another one died last Sunday after as my neighbour said bl 7arf "" l9ineh msaker 3lih fl garage W kchekchou tal3a , jarebna ncharbou l 7lib ama met "" like you expect me to believe that my cat was locked in your damn garage for almost 3/4 days without you being aware of it ?? Bitch you expect me to believe that ?? Mlou , that used to be his name , got stuck once in our garage and he kept meowing and making noise till we got him out and he was locked for less than an hour thankfully..  you expect me to believe he stayed at your garage with no food , no water for 3 days till he died ???  Ok let's say am dumb enough to believe this .. his brother tou2 who was perfectly fine died at their house yesterday .. the same neighbour, and now their other brother is nowhere to be seen .. Is this a coincidence?? Am I being paranoid ??  I don't know ..and that's making me mad .
One more thing the same neighbour said that their daughter got rash which is possibly because of the cats but that's weird .. I mean honestly it's true mlou , tou1 and tou2 are our cats but they don't like being touched they only allow mom to do so .. you want me to believe that they didn't allow me to touch them yet they allowed your daughter to do so ????  
Well .. this might be true if they went to your house ..or lived there except they didn't.. why would they go  to the house of the people who beat them up and chase them with brooms ?? They're animals but they're not dumb enough to leave the house they were born in , being fed in and go to your house to suffer . 

Honestly I don't want to accuse them of doing such a thing as I don't know for sure ( if we forget about my 2 older cats who died two years ago .. after suffering from diarrhoea and abdominal pain which unfortunately I didn't pay too much attention to at that time as I thought it was from milk and diaries ) what really happened or whether they told the truth or lied to us but ..  I can't help but think this is somehow my fault .. what if he was hungry and went there for food as I neglected him ?? What if he was showing signs of being poisoned and I was too ignorant to notice .. 



I'm planning on deleting their videos and photos .. I can't stand looking at them .. I'm feeling sorry for them and for mom who's still crying their tragic death. ...

- I was disorganized and made very bad study schedules
- I was not relying on the most efficient resources
I don't know why I didn't ask some elite students and professors to help me make good plannings , I was just relying on TakiAcademy and I was all like ""I just have to try even harder and study 10 hours a day"" but that was not realistic and videos waste so much time and don't help you to memorize.
I even tried to read books but that's a sea that I should not dive into.

I am sure that they will give me a 0 even though some answers are still visible.

Please anyone help me 🙏😭"," was really smiling at this. ...

It's not about fixing yourself; it's more about organizing yourself and satisfying a ratio of 'how much you must understand / knowledge base,' considering the significant fact that 'learning = doing your failures.

If it worked for them it doesn't necessarily mean it will work for you. Every one is different and you should just find what works best for you.  

My advice is never rely completely on something like takiacademy (walla etude privé) . I recommend prioritising independent study( cour 9odemk w t7awel tefhem le max wa7dk w te5dem wa7dk) and using takiacademy as a supplementary resource. Also you should NEVER quit in the middle of an exam. You should get used to things going wrong and learn to keep yourself calm to deal with it and to make the best out of it.

Good luck with your exams","IT seems you are questioning the big picture of your studies at the worng time, If i am right let me tell you that i was there and probably everyone else who goes throught the education system without knowing exactly why.

I believe that wouldn't work for you as you seem to want to know the mathematicians and how their findings and additions do add some thigns to the world.

I find the LP1 very boring because there is little to no surprises. Sometimes the title is already won weeks before the final games. I live in Canada now and I started watching a bit of MLS and I think the competition is more interesting due to its format.

In Tunisia you have a “Big 4” that rarely changes and a standard classic competition that runs through the year with teams accumulating points, then moving on to the play off they do the same thing only with half the teams left.

I think that should change and a more North America style of competition would make the league a little bit more interesting and the games way more intense.

So we’d go with a regular season with each team playing every other team of the league twice (1 game away and 1 game at home)

Then the top half would qualify to the play offs. The last 2 are relegated and the rest see their season end.

For the play off, rather than just going with another point system why not going with direct elimination (see MLS or NBA playoff system)

So let’s say at the end of the regular season, your table would look like this 

1st 🇦🇸
2nd 🇧🇷
3rd 🇧🇮
4th 🇧🇪
5th 🇦🇽
6th 🇮🇨
7th 🇧🇼
8th 🇧🇹
9th 🇦🇫
10th 🇦🇬
11th 🇦🇺
12th 🇩🇲

So as we can see here, 🇩🇲 & 🇦🇺 would be relegated to LP2

1st until 6th would qualify to the play offs.

Play offs would consist of Quarter Final (Round 1), Semis (Round 2) and Final.

1st and 2nd would directly qualify to Round 2

For Round 1 you’d have 3rd 🇧🇮 playing against 6th 🇮🇨 and 4th 🇧🇪 playing against 5th 🇦🇽

All games of Round 1 would be a home and away game with aggregated points.

Round 2 you’d have 1st playing against the winner of 🇧🇮v🇮🇨 and 2nd playing against the winner of 🇧🇪v🇦🇽

All games of Round 2 would be a home and away game with aggregated points.

Finally you’d have the final that would be 1 game in a predetermined city and stadium that changes every year. It would increase the internal tourism and pressure officials to develop better infrastructure.

75 of colonialism, this is more than the amount of time we’ve been independent.

Reality is that colonialism was caused by Tunisians who mismanaged the big loans we got from Europe from monarchs to Ben Ayed. The colonial administration treated us no worse than how the king administration treated famine and the revolution of Ben Ghethaham. You can technically say that today we also live under a hybrid colonialism ruled by incompetent politicians whose last worries is our well beings and our economic freedoms. 

France should admit obviously to its crimes against our ancestors but that won’t be the key for our development.","Some people here gotta be really dumb to think that we are a poor country because we are having ""corruption"" issues and not being under major affect that still remains from the days of the colonialism. people here gotta touch grass and realize that corruption isn't much of an issue as much as colonialism and the oligarchic society we live in .

Based on the words used in the post you're lucky you didn't get a harsher treatment. Just cause it's satire doesn't mean you get to throw around hate speech (insults etc) towards a specific ideology or group.

As for the post that didn't get deleted: Post recieved zero reports, mods can't realistically view every post word by word.

My questions are: 

1) Am I going to be able to use my Fusha in Tunisia? Will tunisians laught at me for using it? 

2) Is Fusha spoken in Tunisia? What level of Fusha shall I expect in daily situations such as asking for directions, a taxi or an hotel?

For example about the Hamas hostages, Arabs in general and Tunisians in particular will show you only a good picture of how the kidnappers treated the detainees and how the detainees were so thankful to the kidnappers and some even fell in love with their kidnappers according to these people. 

In this they use the photo of a girl who was so chocked and traumatised but at the same time happy she finally is released and was smiling and try to make you believe that that girl was so happy with the treatment she got of the Hamas fighters that she had wished she stayed more.

I am considering moving to Tunisia for it’s looks ideal for my situation at the moment I was just wondering what house prices are like here.

Would a budget of 120000-160000 dinar get me anything and if so what roughly would it get like area bedroom bad/ good condition
Could I get a run down place that’s bigger that I could fix u with this price

And for buying a house I am Algerian so I can buy anything 200000 I’m pretty sure correct me if I’m wrong but I can get a Tunisian passport which I’m trying to do. 



The areas I’m interested in are sousse mahdia (because I have family in those areas) and Tunis, or ares near the border of Algeria  are these good areas and would you recommend 

I was interested in the southern city’s like djerba Sfax gabes since I was told there a bit more conservative like Algeria compared to the rest of Tunisia is this true

Any apps that help see prices of houses in Tunis I’ve been using mubawab if that’s reliable 

I know I asked allot any help would be Appreciated 

بارك لله فيك","In Tabarka they’re building apartments for Algerians for around that price for 1 bedrooms apartments. 

Check it out, [facebook page](https://m.facebook.com/AQUARESORTTABARKA)

Algerians usually prefer Tunis. Downtown apartments aren’t expensive but require lots of renovations. Otherwise, check in Ariana or banlieu sud. 

Sousse is expensive, for nice areas, but Monastir and Mahdia should be good for your budget. Have you figured out what will you be doing for work? Housing isn’t the issue but finding a reliable work is if you’re not in Tunis or/ and not Tunisian. You can live comfortably from investing in capital markets investment firms with annual returns of 10-20% if you have equal money to how much you’re putting on an apartment.","Bizerte is your solution. 2/3 hours max away from Algerian Border.

Recently, I developed an interest in a girl, and she's aware that I'm trying to get to know her. She typically responds after 12 to 24 hours, sometimes apologizing for the delay, sometimes not. Interestingly, all of us seem to be glued to our phones throughout the day, even taking them to the toilet (apologies for the TMI), and it makes me lose interest sometimes.

I didn't want to invest too much energy or pressure someone into talking with me. However, I've noticed that using Facebook messaging makes conversations feel a bit impersonal, and cold. I'm also aware that many guys are trying to engage with her at the same time because she's genuinely kind and polite.

So, an idea struck me. Since she knows my sister and likes noodles, I thought of sending her a message saying, ""My sister has sent you something, and I've left it for you at this location for you to pick up."" The surprise would be a box containing five letters, each revealing something about me, sharing amazing memories, and accompanied by the name of an old song. Each letter also includes a real picture of a place or nature that I personally took. Additionally, there would be two bags of noodles and two dried flowers, which I bought and dried myself.

If she agrees to meet, I plan to come to her on my bike and take her to a secret place with a stunning view of all of Tunis.

I'd like to know what girls think about this. Is this something you would appreciate? I considered placing each letter in a different location to create a sort of adventure or game, but I'm unsure if she would enjoy that.

For context, I'm 28 years old.","Personally, if I like someone, I don't reply 12-24 hours late. So that's not a good sign. 
If I were her, not really into someone who's texting me and he does what you're planning to do, it will definitely freak me out and drive me away as it'll feel like a lot of pressure.

Again, this is my own personal opinion. She can be busy, she can be into you as well, etc.

Good luck!","Good effort and great idea, but directed on the wrong person. Best case scenario she won't care, worst case she's gonna use you.","You'd like to know what girls think about this i'll let you know. You're putting a lot of effort into this but she's clearly not interested in you. Replying once every 24hours is crazy.  
What you had planned is very sweet and original but you should save it for someone who will appreciate it and appreciate you too.  
I'm sorry tho.",,,2024-01-03 20:54:57

Don't, just don't, you're buying the phone at 2x the retail price.

The cheapest and safest way to buy an iPhone is to buy it from another country (preferably USA/Canada/UAE) by telling a friend to buy you or going by yourself. There are other ways to get it from abroad, which is via ***KNOWN*** (not retail/reseller) stores, though they do sketchy stuff to get you that iPhone (such as registering the iPhone's IMEI with someone else's passport at a price), but at the end of the day it's an actual real iPhone.

Stores that I know of are (search on insta): Best Phone, PStore+, Tokyo Store... They usually give you waranty.

If you research enough and learn how to find a counterfeit/used iPhone, you can search on Facebook marketplace / Tayara and review the iPhone for yourself, usually they claim they're new and imported.",Why do people like iPhones so much.

A year ago I bought an iPhone 13 from a local shop, the phone is registered and everything is fine.

2 weeks ago I got an AD from Ooredoo to enable ESIM, I'm interested so I did it (it automatically burns your physical SIM and replaces it with an ESIM).

ESIM worked fine and all EXCEPT, it was registered on the IMEI2 (second sim slot) WHICH APPARENTLY WAS NOT REGISTERED ON SAJALNI.

Now I got a message that I have 15 days to register it otherwise I won't be able to use this sim.

I can't go back to the physical SIM on the first slot cause it's disabled now, so I'm stuck with this and I'm on  a 15-day timer.

Ooredoo support couldn't help and pointed me towards Sajalni (fair).

Sajalni is now saying that I need to register the IMEI2 on their site and that there is no workaround.

Now I have 15 days to register this and I don't even have a passport 🤡

Please help me understand the logic, I know the system is there to combat black-market sellers, but if my first SIM is registered fine, doesn't that mean that my phone was acquired legally?

Please help if you know a way, All my 2FAs and work-related stuff is tied to this phone number.","If you can’t fix the sajalni thing and your 15 days are over, you can go back to your physical sim just visit any ooredoo store and ask for your physical sim you ll have to pay around 5tnd","If you still have proof of purchase, you can go to CERT and prove that you bought your phone legally and that it is supposed to be working fine, see what they tell you. Otherwise, you either get a new SIM (you can keep your number) and go back yo physical, or you can try to someone who traveled recently who will accept to register that IMEI with his info","The shop scammed you. They sold you kontra phones. 

They used 1 passport and registered 2 phones (each with +2 sim ports) by only registring 1 slot, intention is to scam. 

if the phone was legally imported, all the SLOTS would be registered.

1/ start moving you 2FA to another sim and add backup 2FAs.

2/ Try to burn the number and get it into a sim from boutique (say new phone doesn't support esim)","You are not stupid.

It is.","You got scammed by the phone seller. Most iPhones sold in Tunisia are copies and not original.

Black tea from the Chinese shops, take to a boil, then kill the flame and add dried mint (look up online the best way to dry some mint) and that’s it! 

You can choose whatever black tea you want at whatever strength, the taste is 90% the dried mint anyway.

Very easy and it will taste perfectly Tunisian",,,2024-01-04 14:52:09

I was talking to my family about how rude some people can be. Like recently my aunt met Tunisian neighbors and the woman absolutely trashed my aunt for looking older after the last time they saw each other. 
A cousin of mine gave birth and gained weight and her relatives can't stop calling her fat etc. 

What do you say when people are rude and disrespectful like that? 


The audacity of some people, especially older ones (+40)","I deal with such comments in one of two ways:

- If the person is really close (family), I never give it much importance. ""Hadheka had mokhou,"" so either I smile and let it be or I give a sarcastic comment that gives their fish brain a hard time.

  **Example:**
  - *Comment:* ""You look really old (dhhar 3lik lkobr).""
  - *Response:* ""I am living my life to its fullest. I have a lot going on while other people are still in the same spot they were 5 years ago (3Ayech 7yeti biltoul wbil3ardh w 3andibarcha mchaghil, mech kima barcha 3bed mazelet fi nafs lblassa).""

- If the person is a stranger, I will be as blunt as it gets (I do this especially at work).

  **Example:**
  - *Comment:* ""You gained a lot of weight.""
  - *Response:* ""It's none of your business / fuck off (oumour z*** ma3andik mamdakhlikfeha / rabbi ylahhina fi 7wayejna / ken telhit fi rou7ik khir).""",i really feel like the only good way to not create trouble is to avoid them at all costs and not let them be in your circle,Pornhub fi baffle bil ampli foundou.

I have recently noticed that many Tunisians living or born in France speak only in French during Twitter Spaces or TikTok Lives. **This trend seems to be specific to France for some reason**.

If you're inclined to suggest that they learnt French first, you should consider the examples of Douki, a French man who learnt Tunisian in just 6 months, and Lisa, a German woman who lived in Tunisia for 8 years and speaks Tunisian without a foreign accent—her proficiency is both perfect and beautiful.

I have friends who were born and raised abroad; they are fluent in Tunisian and use it exclusively when conversing with us.

However, the individuals I am referring to were participating in discussions about Tunisia, with Tunisians, yet they chose to speak only in French. I found this rather peculiar.

Some of these people were even born and raised in Tunisia but have only lived abroad for a few years.

**Do you think this behaviour is related to the French occupation? Do they feel a sense of inferiority? Or is it indicative of a lack of character ?**","On the same note, why did you write your post in English?","None of the above.

Tunisian father living in France here.

Kids since their first months are exposed to French at least 70% of their time, even if parents talk to them in Arabic, the first language they will pick up is French. Almost every one around them except for their parents speak french, but kids actually figure out pretty early that their parents speak a different language, and will adapt rapidly, my kid, which is starting to speak more and more uses some Arabic words exclusively with us. I always ask at the daycare and school if my kid uses some Arabic words and their answer is ""No"", actually they didn't know that my kid spoke any Arabic.

When kids grow up, some parents don't care if their kids learn how to speak Arabic properly, and it can be hard to dedicate time and money to achieve that, so they just let it go, they don't plan going back to Tunisia anyways, so why bother. Some other parents will do that effort, and will ""force"" their kids to use Arabic when family is around.

People in general, have a preferred language that they use to communicate and express themselves, if you lived all your life in France, it will be easier for you to use french, if you lived in Spain, that would be Spanish if you lived in the Egypt, that would Egyptian Arabic. Neither Spain, nor Egypt occupied Tunisia as far as I know, sooo ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯",المشكلة  الي أنت كاتب بلغة أخرى، علاه متكتبش بالعربية ؟ والا بتونسي ؟ كي باش تكتب والا تتكلم بلغة أخرى باش تولي قاوري ؟ ماك باش تقعد تونسي وعربي وإسمك عربي، لا عمري شفت انا أوروبي ناكر في لغة متاعو ويكتب بالعربي مثلا،,"This is one of the dumbest posts I've seen in a while.

\- React Native

\- React js

\- State management (using redux for both react and react native)

and basically other stuff like javascript/typescript and best practices and architectural choices used in each cases, along with ready components you can copy past, along with explanations.

After these main topics I'm thinking of cover other things I'm experienced in such as native android development in kotlin, flutter development, game development in unity and so on...

anyways, My question here is, is this worth it ? should I spend the next 2 or 3 months trying to develop a good website with interactive examples or would this be just ignored (if it helps 1 person I'll be the happiest person alive probably xD ).

if there are any suggestions or ideas you guys feel that are useful please feel free to tell me, maybe it'll motivate me to spend more daily time on this project.

I will keep the details to a minimum cause they are not relevant I believe. The details are spars anyways.

Here goes:

The catastrophe happened on 04.01.2024

The ex is the perpetrator. He lives a life of catch me if you can it turns out. It's confirmed he has 2 Tunisian identities. Falsified death certificate on one. 
Basically a mafioso wife beating asshole.

It is presumed he escaped to Europe also yesterday using a European pass. Go figure.

Like I said I omitted details.

What I need from the community is pointers on what to expect. How things go down in such cases. What can one do to support the investigation.  A heads up basically.

Please if you have sarcastic comments or are gonna be little What happened just don't. 

I would imagine most help would come from those with legal knowledge and anyone with 1st hand experience (to whom I say am sorry and thank you).

I will not provide more details and I will most likely delete my account after this post. To tell you the truth I dunno if it's smart doing this and might delete the actual post - if I figure out how.

I thank you all.","Internet smear campaign. Check out Ena Zeda, Najjem N3awen, Mauvais plan, etc. 

Make sure this fucker's digital footprint is absolutely decimated.",make sure to press the police to get his info in the interpol database asap otherwise foreign authorirs cant check if he is wanted,Get a good lawyer that has some connections with the police.,"I will check up on the comments from time to time.

I want to say thank you again. And believe me I will read every comment and tip. even if I don't respond know that am grateful. And I swear to the almighty this will not go unpunished. She had many friend and am only one. We all want justice. We will go all the way. The fucker will have to move to Afghanistan or rot in jail. 

In time I will make a post with an update to let you know how things are , what happened and the works.

I will say for me the situation is unreal, feels like a movie. To know someone you sat with can be so evil and so merciless. Am left with anger and fear - a weird combination.

I'll say about her she was a kind, smart, stubborn dumb ass ( said with love). She couldn't take what happened to her and fought for her right. She paid the ultimate price. We all told her to take the cowards way out. Get free of him and that in itself is a win. But she refused. The hand of the law was slow. She left behind an angel that will know - mother was strong, mother decided to fight for what's right and just, mother was loved.

Again thank you, be safe, support one another please. Have empathy to others, stop at the red lights, give to the poor. Just try to be good and kind. It starts with us. We need to change for the world around us to change. Am blabbering and I bet you know why. Can barely see my keyboard. I don't understand how some could be so selfish, so uncaring and so heartless.

I’m thinking of celebrating my wedding anniversary with a smallish wedding in Tunis, we got married just before Covid and had planned to celebrate in Tunisia but Covid stopped that. I haven’t celebrated with my Tunisian family yet. I am really struggling to estimate what kind of budget we’d need for this…

I have a large family and off the top of my head have counted 150 people (on my grandmothers side, I still haven’t counted anyone from my grandpas side but I barely know that side). I know that no one RSVPs these things, so how do I even estimate how many people will come? I know people bring their neighbours, cousins, random people lol (and I don’t mind but it’s just confusing from an organisational point). 

I want the wedding to be in Tunis, we will only do one day rather than multiple as it’s simply our anniversary. I will rent my dress rather than buy it, and I don’t want to do it in a fancy hotel, I’d rather do it on a sta7 but I don’t have one available to me so a basic hall is fine with me. I’m happy to rent a hall in manouba or cite etahrir as that’s where the majority of my family are anyways. 

What kind of budget do you think I will need for this? How much did you or your family spend on your weddings?","I am a stats/data maniac and i almost record everything i do, this was my marriage cost: https://imgur.com/a/a053vwQ

If you remove:

* the trip (less ~30k)

* reduce the cost of some of the house items (less ~5k, in your case all the house stuff)

* do it in a ""sala"" not a Hotel (less ~3k)

* Rent a suit instead of buying it (less ~2k)

* cheaper gold (less ~2k) though what we did was super cheap too because we didn't even want to do it, it was ""me5dha fel 5ater"" to our parents.

&nbsp;

Then you just removed 41k of what i spent, so you end up with ~25k 

I think this is the minimum average to spend. 

&nbsp;

Keep in mind that i didn't do a ""mbita/7enna"" because i dont like those either, instead I went with 17 of my friends (all boys) we rented a very big chalet somewhere outside Benzart for 3 days, and it was basically a private festival, food, alcohol, weed, music, pool, good nature, etc.. that is the ""ba3be3i"" part in the sheets lol

&nbsp;

I ended up doing the ""3ché"" though which is the equivilant of ""7enna/mbita"" but i didn't give a single Dannous there, my family covered it, i think it costed ~4k or something. 


&nbsp;

My wife also didn't do ""wteyya"", instead she just did the ""7ammem"" thingy with her friends and some family members, I think it costed ~2k.

Obligatory sad-political reminder that :

25k tnd is barely 7.5K euro...

It depends if u're a devout person u will find it haram but generally speaking in tunisia everyone is doing it anyway just don't do it publicly bcz it's illegal.

> Do Tunisian girls know how to kiss a boy? (after marriage) and how can I show affection to a Tunisian girl without making her uncomfortable?

Again tunisian girls are not aliens, who doesn't as human beings we know these things it's normal n natural to show affection to ur significant other, It depends if she's experienced or not ofc if she never kissed someone before it would be weird at first.

First u should make a good bond with her n know from her body language if she's into u or not if u connect well with each other then u can ask her it's simple but u should respect her if she wants to do this with u or nah.",">  but is kissing a tunisian girl from lips before marriage haram? 

Wrong question to ask. Haram is against God's rules now against people's and yes it is haram before marriage.

>  if it is after marriage can I do it? 

Obviously.

> Do Tunisian girls know how to kiss a boy? (after marriage) 

Even if you both don't know you can practise together. (After marriage obviously)

> and how can I show affection to a Tunisian girl without making her uncomfortable? 

You gotta take a decision, you said you pray in the mosque in another comment. Are you going to choose to go against God's words for your lust or someone's lust or are you going to focus on doing right?

As for the generalised idea, some do and some don't but the ones they do (basically the ones that don't care about religion and/or their family's values and just follow their lusts), do it in private. Even married couples do it in private, it's also haram to be a cuck and display your woman for others to lust over like that (just like porn basically).",2024-01-06 10:44:36

- The walls of Tunisia hold more culture than its people.


- Going abroad isn't an ethical crime unless you put your entire worth and identity in the ""compte blocké"" too.

- The sum of money is the bare minimum to provide your family and think about your children's future, but well, the bare minimum is the truest Tunisian legacy.

- The superior job title won't save you from the struggles of this world.

But, hey, at all times, get that bag, sis.","i remeber there was some kids who wanted to go to italy i have given him the advice to learn welding and get a certification , he looked at me like i have insulted his mother","Tunisia is a tutorial level country. No economic policy was implemented here with the best interest in mind. By that I mean with full consideration of the characteristics that made this land (historically) an attractive boon to conquer. It's a successive shuffling of multiple copycat economic ""reforms"" from other shitholes. Remember the communist experiment? Then we were quasi-socialist. Or not? I could chalk this up to top down buffoonery from the people warming up executive offices, but no that's not.. it? Everyone agrees that our cabinet in the 70's/80's were comprised of relatively competent people. Not competent enough to put off a bread revolution thoughever. Not competent enough to prevent the planting of the seeds that would later lead to the dismantlement of multiple native industries in favor of transitioning the economy to a pseudo-service economy. 

The most hysterical facet to observe is seeing genuienly sound policies, breed incremental dismantlement of Tunisian fabric of society. See the literacy boom of the 1960's, 70's, 80's. The ""ten7iyet le9mal"" campaign. This uncontested success of our post colonial governments, was taking a virtually agrarian, middle-ages tier society and forcefully marching them all into the 20th century. Fuck. Me. We had internet before a majority of the Latin speaking world. We had institutionalized edicts that incur beheadings in certain world regions. We had settled debates that still plague parts of the first world (eg abortion). We moonwalked into globalization ass first ready for a good decent rape. 

The result is... curiously enough, not that different from the countries we'd tried to emulate. An over-""educated"" (formally of course) populace. A saturated local market, overflooded with degrees from wherever with whatever inscription engraved on top. Did you know that 40% of tenured public sector employees got in (post 2011) with forged certificates? Of course you didn't know that because I just pulled that number out of my ass. That doesn't make that queer fact any less queer and any less true and any less sickening frankly. 

That's what makes our localized recession even more insidious. The dishonesty, slyness, corruption, not those no. Those are global vices, and they are present in most post-industrial advanced countries. It's the lawlessness. Tunisia is a lawless country. It's not a capitalist hellscape, or an immoral hovel of un-islamic practices. Tunisia is **lawless.** Tunisia is the proverbial 21st century mini-me wild west. It props up institutions under the guise of enforcing the law. But does it? It stalls. It procrastinates. It pretends to execute some form of the law. ""It"" (being the powers that be lmao) tries to straddle the middle ground so steadfastly, by placating everyone and their mother that the law becomes moot. The law is an ornament. It's the cosmetic operation with which we hope to not get clocked as a  ""pretend"" country. 

Anyways, what was the og goalpost? Oh, yeah. People are le people. They'll do anything to ensure their stability (financial, etc) and unfortunately, that could come with at the cost of some (also man made) ideals like national identity. Tunisia has been relatively inhospitable even prior to the revolution. (inb4 no life was le good. You were a kid, probably middle cl\*ss). It is what it is. People yejriw wra l5obza since circa 1970. That's why every Tunisian family had that one distant (or close) uncle who immigrated to rebuild France post ww2 in the days where the green passport was a respected nifty document. It's not ideological. It's not cultural. It's a perennial strife for survival by accumulating wealth. It's human nature.","sounds like a big blues realization.. but hey.. I second that.

Breaking the mesmar fi 7itt mentality is the way to salvation","The group psychology of Tunisians makes us all want the same thing at the same time and very very quickly move on from it all at once. Remember back in 2021 when there were very long lines for people to get the covid vaccine, and there was an absolute fiasco with the organisation?  Our current president / national savior took over power because of that event. Not long after that people stopped wanting the vaccine altogether.

People complain that Zgougou is more expensive each year, but the lines at the Zgougou shop in rue d'Espagne are just as long each year.

We all think similarly. And I'm not saying that this is a purely Tunisian thing. It may well be a global phenomenon.

This is made worse by our successive leaders' inability, or unwillingness, to think strategically. The first president considered the country to be his own plaything, and saw himself as a genius, a nigh-sanctified being. So he tried a thing after another, including an attempt at ruling until death.

And in that case you need to create a company (entreprise personnelle is the simplest form) and export your services to your employer (so they will be paying you fees rather than a salary). Taxes in Tunisia are generally lower than European and American states, and you get particularly favorable treatment as a société totalement exportatrice (a good accounting firm would help you create your company and take advantage of all tax cut opportunities in Tunisia).",,,,,2024-01-06 09:46:58

I am not renting a car and will use public transportation when accessible and taxis when the latter is unavailable

I wanted to visit Jendouba (to reach Bulla Regia), El Kef, and Subaytilah but all three have travel DO NOT TRAVEL advisories listed by foreign states due to terrorism and kidnapping.

Are these cities dangerous for western foreigners? Would it be safe for someone in my shoes?

I have travel experience in Morocco and Turkey and I previously bused my way from Finland to Greece.

EDIT:

To those taking offense to my post

I would not consider visiting places deemed dangerous by my government if I didn't think there was a possibility that the advice is wrong. I have no intention of disrespecting Tunisia or Tunisians. All I want is clarification from Tunisians and other travelers. I am visiting many places in Tunisia that I did not mention in this post because nothing indicates they would be the least bit dangerous at all.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;","Just a quick explanation, OP isn't expressing personal views here, those are literally government safety recommendations provided to citizens.

This has nothing to do with politics nor personal views.

OP is here to simply ask about the opinion of locals on how safe some areas are.

For the ones getting super defensive in the comments, calm your tits.

Also overgeneralizations about another country as a ""triggered"" response are not welcomed, respect other users.","Well although i do understand your concerns about safety but i find  how u rephrased the question is kinda bad , tunisia doesn't have a civil war or is a jungle without law for that to easily happen, if some locations are dangerous you will find them close to public probably and as mentioned before it's better to bring a local or someone so you don't get scammed or lost and that's it",I mean you come from a country that has school shootings and gunfights by the minute. Good thing we don't have that kind of chaos here.,Yeah safe just avoid the mountains of Kasserine. A ww2 old british fan has been travelling solo those areas annually and he is fine. And he goes deep in hills and forests. You should totally go and learn several words in tunisian and french.,"The only areas I know to be genuinely unsafe are close to the border with Libya, everywhere else is fine. But you might struggle with the language barrier (once you leave big cities way less people speak French let alone English). You’re likely to get scammed a bit, as a foreigner, but nothing too wild.

If you’ve travelled Morocco you’ll find that Tunisians are even more welcoming and less likely to scam you. And you’re a man so the danger you might encounter travelling solo is nothing compared to being a woman alone. Go and enjoy!",2024-01-06 02:57:38

Berges du Lac seems like a ""wealthy"", modern and quiet area, which are traits that I like since I mostly plan on doing daytrips and just visit historical landmarks. I'm not really interested in nightlife, shopping, restaurants or bars... I only prioritize to have access to good supermarkets lol   


However, I feel like Berges du Lac may be a rather boring place and I always enjoy taking a walk around and feel the city vibes, so I'm wondering if you would suggest me to stay better in Tunis city centre. I also considered Gammarth but it looks like a place just full of dull resorts.  


Thanks.","I mean if you want to experience souks, old coffee shops, el medina and see the old buildings and that cultural stuff I would suggest tunis centre but be warned, the streets are very dirty. It’s definitely not high end or classy. 

The street food is bomb but again hygiene is not great in that area, consume at your own risk. You can assess the cleanliness of most sandwich shops on your own as they literally make it in front of you.

As for safety, it’s safe enough I guess? Just don’t be walking with your phone or wallet in your hand, if it’s crowded wear your backpack in the front/ keep handbag near and you should be alright. (This is me being very cautious and diligent, I don’t even follow these instructions but you do what I say, not what I do, for maximum security lol).

1913psr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1913psr/first_impression_of_tunisia_from_an_outsider/,18,First impression of Tunisia… from an outsider.,"I’m Indonesian, and I just visited Tunisia at the end of last year (which was one week ago) to visit my boyfriend’s family. Tunisia is very beautiful. The coastline? Breathtaking. The hills around Tunis that you can see from the Highway? Beautiful. The food? Amazing. The seafood? SCRUMPTIOUS. Here are some positive things I really loved:

1. People are extremely friendly:
We went to the market and bought some stuff for New Year’s Eve. At the butcher, the man asked me where I’m from and he said welcome. The fruit-veggie seller said welcome and even wanted to give me the veggies for free (I rejected, of course). The guy at the Bourguiba Museum said welcome and told me that it’s fascinating that Indonesia is the world’s biggest Muslim-majority country. People are so friendly!
2. Amazing food scene:
I am Indonesian - I love spicy food! I think I’ve been eating so much. I love the seafood, it’s so fresh and reminds me of home. I love the sweets. The portions are also huge - this part is when my boyfriend steps in and would help finish my food!
3. Great entertainment:
Coffee shops, bars, all these things are important for me. I love how it’s very open. So much music, dancing - or even just to hang out and talk with your friends. It’s very nice to see these places all lively and crowded, especially on weekends.
4. Rich culture and history:
I went to the Museum in Bardo and in Sousse. Both museums are amazing. So much history, and as a history nerd, I was so delighted to see that they are preserved. These are the things that Tunisia, as a country, needs to protect as Tunisia has thousands of years of rich history. The guide we had in Bardo was super nice and gave us a thorough explanation on Tunisian history. 

But, here are some negative things I noticed:
1. Lack of public transportation:
See, as an Indonesian, I can’t really criticize Tunisia on this, but considering the fact that Tunisia is rather small compared to Indonesia, I think the country can do so much better.
I took the SNCFT from Sousse to Tunis. The train arrived (30 mins late), I cannot help but notice that the trains are very similar to what we used to have before a massive transformation around a decade ago.
The Tunis-Carthage airport is also chaotic. I really love the architecture inside, I find it very original, but I find it too chaotic - too many staffs, they change gates without prior notification, etc. 
This lack of public transport is then added up by another issue, which is the fact that cars are heavily taxed. My boyfriend’s mom thought that I am very rich because I have my own car in Indonesia. I am not. When I heard that my tiny, €6.5k car costs almost €8.5k in Tunisia, I was shook. How are people supposed to transport themselves if cars are very expensive but yet public transport is severely lacking?
2. Lack of digitalization:
When I asked my boyfriend if we could buy the train tickets online, he laughed. I also had to stick to cash - I’ve never handled cash, ever. In Indonesia, we pay with bank apps and e-wallet apps by scanning QR Codes. In Tunis, my card got declined 3 times - there was not even a notification that the transaction failed, which means that the card machine didn’t even work.

Negative sides aside, I had an amazing time in Tunisia. Will definitely re-visit sometime in the Summer! 3aychek!",You're welcome anytime.,"I'm glad that you enjoyed your trip, and we hope you come visit us again.  
Yes, we have been suffering from public transportation for decades, and no one has yet found a solution (this includes the bus, the train, the metro and even Tunisair flights-planes).

However, using cards to pay is not yet a culture here, you can say that all Tunisians must have cash to shop comfortably, but we are getting better day by day (but slowly), we mostly use cards to extract cash from ATM.","Very glad you enjoyed your stay ! All the negative points are more than fair, they're points we also complain about a lot (saying digitalization is almost a meme now. everyone talks about it, no one makes it happen lmao). There are alternative forms of public transportation, not very environmentally friendly, but they're a good alternative for people who don't have cars: intercity types of long distance fixed destination cabs (louages). Inside cities there are other alternatives too. But for various reasons infrastructure investments have dropped for a little more than a decade now, and I think it'll take time to fix and improve these very real issues.",,,2024-01-07 21:52:49

So I'm 28M, born in France from Tunisian parents. Lived all my life here and visit almost every year Tunisia, not going to hotels but essentially visiting familly and having a good time. 

Between me and Tunisia, that often been a ""I love you - me neither"" story. Like Tunisia has a special place in my heart as this is my parents' country, land of my ancestors, and I have many memories here. But I never felt I'm really ""welcomed"". By ""welcomed"", I don't mean waiting the red carpet and glitter 😂 But being looked strange, sometimes being made fun of my accent when speaking tunisian to someone I just met, meeting Tunisians who came in France (for studies/work) and feeling them ""awkward"" with me (I also noticed that some Tunsians didn't really like other Tunisians, but that's another topic). Concerning familly, a lot tolerated us when we used to bring them things like clothes, electronic or money, then barely talk to us anymore since they don't ""need"" us anymore. I questionned a lot of things after that.

This reddit may be the only place I can get to talk with ""real"" Tunisians, if I can say like this. How do you consider those born into the diaspora, abroad ? No filter, what you really think of us and like/dislike about us.

The country has its flaws. Live with it or get fucked.","Bonjour, je me permet de te répondre en Français car tu as précisé que tu as grandi là-bas. 

Alors, les relations entre ""natifs"" et ""nés à l'étranger"" (aussi appellé zmigri) est , comme tu l'as décrite, assez ""je t'aime moi non plus"".
Je vais essayer de faire un résumé concis

Les natifs perçoient les zmigris comme arrogant, hypocrites, et très jugemental. Cela vient du fait que certains zmigris ont un comportement plus que problématique une fois en tunisie, n'hésitant pas à se plaindre à tout va voir de faire des leçons de morales aux locaux, notamment sur la religion( les zmigris SONT BEAUCOUP PLUS CONSERVATEURS que les natifs) ou certains aspects. Aussi plusieurs personnes candidates à l'émigration en France ont cru avoir de la famille en france mais ce sont fait lâcher par ceux-ci une fois arrivé en france... Tu ajoutes à cela simplement le rejet de la différence des autres. Pour autant les natifs vont être très généralement accueillants et vont soutenir les tunisiens de l'étranger.

Ceux nés en France voient généralement les natifs comme arriérés, bledards, profiteurs et indigne de confiances. Il y a toujours un sentiment que les natifs sont en retard sur certains points, voir qu'ils refusent la ""civilisation"". De plus il y a l'idée que les natifs vont automatiquement essayer de profiter des leurs compatriotes en demandant argent etc sans limites. Les zmigris percoivent aussi les natifs comme impies car n'étant pas assez islamique à leur yeux

Bon, il y a tellement de clichés entre les deux populations qui n'ont pas été cités, mais c'était justz pour illustrer le fait les visions et préjugés que les uns ont sur les autres. 

Aussi, les tunisiens à l'étranger sont aussi pas super chauds à l'idée de se faire des potes tunisiens ailleurs car ils ont peur que ceux-ci parlent de leur modes de vies à leur famille au pays, etc. Étant moi-même tunisien en france, on s'évite de pzur de se faire juger voir de devoir rendre des comptes si on se fait balancer. Bon généralement si les deux sont sur la même longueur d'ondes l'amitié devient possible",https://preview.redd.it/77dddfup43bc1.png?width=1053&format=png&auto=webp&s=37702f5577242de3ef9e2f4d4addb50e7a206a9c,"As a diaspora Tunisian who was not born in France, I hope people here differentiate between us (Germany, Austria, Netherlands etc) and Franco-Tunisians xD

(tbf we have many stereotypes about Tunisians from France, where I live)

One of them is that Tunisians from France don't bother to learn tounsi. While most Tunisians here are able to communicate in Tunisian, even if broken, I feel like 95% of Franco-Tunisians I met spoke like ""90% French and 10% Tunisian"" because they know that French is spoken by virtually everyone in coastal Tunisia 

Anyways, curious to see what others say and I hope you're not offended by my remarks but it's a widespread idea here lmao

I decided to post here since it's the best place to ask about Tunisia. We have booked our first international holiday in Hammamet and I'm a preparation freak so I'd want to ask about a few things.

1. How is the public transport working in Hammamet area? Are there any buses or trains so we can travel around the region? Our local govt recommends using SNTRI buses but I cannot find any information nor timetables for these lines. We'd like to travel Yasmin Hammamet -> Hammamet -> Nabeul.   
Alternatively we are considering taking a taxi, but how high are the fares nowadays? How do I catch/order the taxi? Is it possible to communicate with drivers in ENG or rather in French or Arabic?  
Furthermore, does Google Maps work well in Hammamet? Or is it better to stick to local maps and just ask in the hotel for directions?
2. How can we recognise tourist traps? I'd love to try real tunisian cuisine, but I'm afraid that there's gonna be a lot of places catered especially to tourists since we are visiting a resort city.
3. What can you recommend to visit in Hammamet area? I know that there are WWII historical places and that Nabeul is known for ceramics.
4. How safe is Hammamet? Are there any place in particular that we shouldn't visit?
5. I'd be very thankful for any cultural/behavioral advices so we are not ignorant while visiting 🫶

Thank you guys for your responses!","I’m not from the region but ill do my best

1. The hammamet area is not that big, while there are taxis you can get most places by foot. If you need it though taxis are everywhere and not that expensive. If you intend on getting far from hammamet like nabeul you can take “Louage” which are privately owned collective taxis that have designated spots for every city (you can ask your taxi driver to take you to the louage station)

Most people speak french on a semi fluent level but basic English should get you what you need.

Google maps works just fine for everything except for public transport.

2. For actual Tunisian cuisine you’re better off trying it in Nabeul to immerse yourself in local culture, but then again options are available in Hammamet too.

3. The amusement parks / the medina / yasmine hammamet / the port / the old city / thats as far as my knowledge goes

4. Hammamet is very touristy, thus more on the safe side. Use common sense and you should be okay.

5. Nothing of note, just be respectful and you’ll have a lovely stay.",,,,,2024-01-07 17:18:48

Nous allons former la personne, ma question c’est est-ce qu’on est dans la bonne moyenne ?
On ne veut pas exploiter qui que  ce soit.


Info complémentaire :
C’est 8H de travail / jours
Vacance non payée
5 jours par semaine.


Merci de votre réponse !","400$ is not enough for an experienced employee, 40H per week is the normal work hours here, 600$ is a fair amount.

If he has 0 experience, 400$ is good.","A receptionist in Tunisia earns around 350 US Dollar per month after taxes, with a semestrial performance bonus in June and December that can go up to 1 full salary each depending on performance. Plus 2 days of paid leave per month, 11 paid holidays and a meal for every day worked. A majority of the hotel employees don't take their leave but ask to get them paid. This for 42 hours per week, not taking into account night shifts. 


350 x 12 monthly salaries = 4200
350 x 2 semestrial bonuses = 700
(35 days of leave × 8 hours) / 42 hours per week) = 6.75 weeks of additional pay   +/- 1.5 × 350 = 525 
2.5 USD × 260 meals = 650 

Totals: 6075 USD nett

+ 28 % CNSS
+ 13.5 % impot, SS et Foprolo 
 
= 6075 × 1.415 = +/- 8600 USD per year","WTF is ""hôtel virtuel"" in the Tunisian law? Gouna?","C plutôt dans les 400$ *13 par an mais net d'impôts
Donc calcule le brut (irpp + CNSS + une petite mutuelle santé si possible) donc ca monte presque a 6500 $ -7000$ par an",,2024-01-07 16:59:38
190vxz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/190vxz3/my_own_political_opinion_on_my_homeland_from_a/,7,My own political opinion on my homeland from a Tunisian living abroad,"Hi. I’m a Tunisian who left to New York when I was 18 on my own . I’m 27 now and I went from  nothing to a software engineer graduate with permanent residency . Something I couldn’t achieve in Tunisia unfortunately due to the lack of capable politicians and massive corruption and populism . I’am thinking of creating a political party in Tunisia for a modern liberal and democratic future to my homeland this is what I have as ideas so far . And for someone who works at a FAANG company I can say that attracting investors from the US is pretty achievable. Here’s my suggestions in order for our country to prosper since we have small population. And well educated compared to other nations 


Creating free market economy

English as second language and add it to the educational curriculum as lead language in learning scientific subjects and majors aswell as 
Lower taxes on businesses

Building up IT and medical universities and research centers

Funds to new startups and successful companies and push them to be added to Tunisian stock market . 

48 hours period for new licenses ( digital applications ) 

Create a public investment fund 


Create new economical capital ( Ennfidha) aswell as investing in infrastructure. 

Crackdown on counterfeit economy with taxation solutions 


Low interest mortgage loans 


Investment summit with US and Asian and European investors ( IT , Industry , healthcare , tourism , agriculture ) 

Libéralise laws ( getting rid of laws such as only Muslims can be presidents , country religion is Islam which is excluding of other Tunisian minorities , decriminalizing homosexuality , legalization of marijuana and  create an industry sector for it we could be a touristic destination for it 

Cancel unnecessary adiministrations and ministries . 

Digitalization of government services 


Privatize all industries except natural recources ( government will still hire private companies for logistics services ) 

Install surveillance cameras around the streets and modernize interior security 

Modernize military and increase cooperation with NATO 

Weed out any old backward laws and decrease diplomatic and economical relations with authoritarian regimes 

Increase minimum wage to 800$/ month equivalent to 6$/ hour for 35 hours workweek. ( overtime is 9$/hour time and half ) 

Free floating currency 

Invest in bigger ports and airports aswell as increasing aircraft’s fleet and destinations ( through privatization of TunisAir ) 

Neutralize our political stance on geopolitical conflicts. ( Tunisia shall always advocate for peace prosperity and liberties ) 


Modernize prisons and renovate them to human rights standards. Creating better learning and correction systems prisoners will be able to read books go to therapy sessions and learn skills . Aswell as finish their studies .","Though I agree with a lot of things you suggested, It would take a miracle for them to actually happen. You stated solutions but not a way to reach those solutions. One example is the 'install surveillance cameras' part; it's defenitly a good idea but we're too broke to do that.","Man, the youth dreams..","Not to say your suggestions are bad, in the contrary they are pretty good, but you’ll be delusional if you think you can implement them in Tunisia.

Go back to Tunisia and see how the system works and how you can fix it, before coming down with this top-down approach and suggestions that are not specific to the Tunisian case.","Also a Tunisian in NY (been here 5 years) and am on the same page, these are certainly the changes that need to be made. However, knowing Tunisia and having been somewhat close to the political scene, I can say pretty confidently that this can’t be achieved overnight and will likely become your life’s work. That being said, I would like to help you out in any way possible. 

I think the best way for you to start is to organize your ideas and write out a robust plan/timeline (ie a manifesto). Feel free to dm, would love to discuss this w u.","Don’t waist your time on politics in Tunisia, to be frank…many like you have been there before and without any exception they didn’t stand a chance and got quickly disillusioned. 

First thing is that you assume it’s about having sound ideas and if u converse them well enough u get votes…might be the case somewhere else but not in Tunisia. Secondly, implementation is a whole different beast in Tunisia as well. 

I’d say forget bout Tunisian politics. The country will follows its path anyway. If u want to do something meaningful back to the country you were born in u could do some charity etc. 

Just my advice.",2024-01-07 16:30:30

Hello im recently graduated 2023 
recently got a job offer as english teacher salary is 800$ and will be increased once every year , contract is 2 years mn ghir la nrwah 
what you guys think ? nosdom or salary too low?","It’s not worth it. $800 is literally nothing. Thats slavery wage in a country like Saudi arabia. Think of your end goal. You’re going to a country where you won’t save with that salary and you know a country like Saudi can never be your end game because the day your contract isn’t renewed you’re out within a week. And since your employer is your immigration sponsor you won’t be able to change a job. It’s also not a pleasant country like poor asian countries where expats spend 2 years of their lives getting paid next to nothing but at least exploring a culture and enjoying it. So ask yourself is it worth it? Hell fucking no! Tutor english in Tunisia and you’ll make much more than that.

And I’m not patronizing you but 
ينعبو البلاد القحبة و الي يحكموا فيها الي موصلين التوانسة لهذي الحال في انهم يخرجوا بش يعيشوا مستعبدين عند البراينية","Salary is quite low.

I just left saudi arabia for good, after trying my best to find a job there. I was met with salaries like this, and i rejected them all. 

due to many reasons.

1- Job security: there is no job security in Saudi arabia specially for foreigners and Arabs specifically. Saudization laws are being struck yearly and you just have to put your hand on your heart everytime you open twitter/X when a new law is on.

\- if there is a saudi national who comes to apply to be an english teacher at your school, and sees you. the school might push you out unethically.

&#x200B;

2- Renewals: I dont think this will come as an issue during your contract, specially if they give you two years IQAMA instantly (if they give you 1 year IQAMA it might be a hassle to renew it if the school wants to let you go). 

\- If you decided to leave the school to go find another job (given that the school allows you to do that), you are looking at a very competitive market that millions of foreigners are looking for jobs, especially now with the Sudan situation and other Arab nations problems they all flooded the job market.

\- Also if your IQAMA expires, you would need to find Kafeel and everything you made or saved up during your employment will be returned back to KSA and Kafeel.

How ? 2000 transfer IQAMA fees

9800 SAR to renew the IQAMA

1000 SAR for health insurance (must and cheapest)

400\~500 SAR per month for the Kafeel.

Oh and transportation in Saudi is expensive and the public system is new and extremely unreliable.

so you would need a car which would cost you 20k upwards. and you cant own a car without saudi driving license.

and driving license would cost you from 1000 SAR to 3000 and more, including transportation back and forth.

3- Slavery: going in the Kafalah of the school or a kafeel is like marriage, if they are good then you are very very lucky and if they are bad then you will be miserable.

\- say you decided to go outside of KSA, you need to be allowed by your employer to leave in the system. you cant just get your passport and leave.

\- even if you leave saudi for good you need allowance from the employer or the Kafeel.

&#x200B;

4- diminishing economy: The economy is not what it looks like from the outside, it is actually pretty bad, and you can feel it. the people foreigners and citizens alike are not liking it here, everything is getting more expensive and the income is not changed.

&#x200B;

\- unemployment rate amongst Saudi people are high and the govt is trying to kick foreigners and replacing them with locals. so you might see locals on twitter ranting about foreigners.

&#x200B;

5- weather: the weather is extremely hot you cant imagine it until you come here. it is bad period, going to the south the weather might be better but it can get extremely cold and it sucks.

&#x200B;

I cant believe I typed all that but take this into consideration and excuse grammar mistakes I done this in a Hurry.","how much you will spend on rent? food? how much you will save every month? 

does not seems very attractive…","800 dollar is like 3k ryal saudi, and it's the same salary that they give to pakistani and indie employees. 

with 3k you will live very tight and you will not be able to save or to enjoy once a month.

keep in mind that fresh graduate in saudi arabia get minimum wage of 6500 ryal. (those who have saudi citizenship).","Nope, salary mehich mta3 teacher. Khayba barcha",2024-01-07 09:35:11

* Low fees: monthly fee, transaction fees...etc. I never looked deeply into Tunisian banks but from what I heard it seems like they charge you for anything and everything
* Bonus: Ease of investing into Tunisian stocks or real estate long term. I honestly wouldn't choose to do so but I find myself having to take dinars for personal/family reasons and it's better to not have them rot away due to inflation ","For context/background:

I opened an account with Attijari a couple of years ago including a dollar account and honestly I wasn't impressed.

They treated me like shit when I tried to convert dollars into dinars and said I should go to the airport to get a simple receipt which I later found out was just them being lazy and didn't need to be done at the airport, they made me go through bureaucratic hell to open the damn account and never replied to emails. I was told their online services are good but it was pretty awful. They never sent me my Tunisian debit card to my Tunisian address.. and I can go on.

I highlighted their imports here: [https://imgur.com/a/xNOCRtE](https://imgur.com/a/xNOCRtE) (source: [INS](https://www.ins.tn/sites/default/files-ftp/files/publication/pdf/bms%20septembre%202023.pdf))

Comparing the first 9 months in 2022 and 2023:

* Coffee imports were reduced from 24400 tons to 2800 tons. Only 11% of last year.
* Tea from 5000 tons to 100 tons. Only 2% of last year.
* Ble tendre from 984000 tons to 863000 tons. Only 89% of last year.

Just to understand how blatant these numbers are, tea imports for the whole country for 9 months can be carried in 5 semi-trailer trucks. For this to be enough, 1090 Tunisians need to share a one kg bag of tea per month. Or in other words, 1g per Tunisian per month. Anyone can attest that tea specifically is nearly inexistent which unsurprisingly matches the insane drop in imports.

The same story applies to coffee to a lesser degree but still very significant and anyone can tell you that you can't buy Tunisian roasted coffee in supermarkets. It also applies to farina to a lesser degree and that's why there's constant shortages of bread but also farina itself has significant shortages in markets.

The president acts as the head of the government so this decrease in imports cannot have been done without his approval. If it was without his approval and since he constantly talks about these issues, it would be criminal negligence for him to not ask about the most basic statistics before talking about this. If I can see these stats, he can too.

Here's the president saying some people are causing coffee shortages to destabilize the country...etc while at the same time knowing that he imported 11% of the normal amounts: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEjAGsjQI-Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEjAGsjQI-Q)","I wanted to keep it simple because it doesn't get clearer than this that the president and his government are being malicious. 

I'll pre-answer some of the things people will ask/think:

**What about other products where imports increased?** 

They're all locally produced and their production went down significantly so while imports increased it doesn't mean it was not enough to cover the deficit.

Here's [figures](https://www.oc.com.tn/ar/%d8%aa%d9%82%d8%af%d9%91%d9%85-%d8%b9%d9%85%d9%84%d9%8a%d8%a9-%d8%aa%d8%ac%d9%85%d9%8a%d8%b9-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%ad%d8%a8%d9%88%d8%a8-%d8%b9%d9%84%d9%89-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b5%d8%b9%d9%8a%d8%af-%d8%a7-10/) from Office des Cereales. They actually incorrectly labelled 2023 as 2022 and vice versa (I'll pretend that's not intentional) but local production went down to less than half of last year. For ble dur, the decrease amounted to 3600000 quintal = 360000 tons. We can't simply calculate the expected impact compared to the first 9 months because the government got to use the 2022 production in those months. 

Local production of sugar accounts to close to half of needs and it's been going down recently. Potatoes production tanked after farmers stopped producing them because they were being arrested last year for keeping them in freezers to sell out of season. Milk production tanked after the government refused to raise prices and people started selling cattle. 

**We produce ble tendre/farina** 

We do but it's negligeable. It's about 5% compared to ble dur and last year there was almost 0 production in ble tendre in 2023 so decreasing its imports is even more blatant proof of causing shortages. This is also the real reason why they want to make bread with ble dur because ble tendre is imported.",,,,,2024-01-08 21:53:30

As for mansions, in grand Tunis is unreasonably expensive (haut standing appartment s+2 goes up to 400k dt in a good neighborhood), if you build you own and KEEP AN EYE on the construction deal, I think it'd be a better option 400k can build you a castle.

Im not Tunisian but I’ve Tunisian friends. I constantly hear about how bad the political and economical situation is in Tunisia. Could you please explain? Is it true if so why?","Aslema, this is a quick recap:

Politics:

- serious democratic backsliding, major concentration of powers in the presidency and no checks or balances, weak state institutions, endangered judicial independence (the minister of justice under presidential orders is meddling in the judiciary), arbitrary political regime with unclear prerogatives, growing restrictions on freedoms, extreme populism + conspiract theorists + paranoia (you are either pro-president or a traitor to the people), growing diplomatic isolation, opposition leaders in jail for malicious charges, restrictions on media and civil society, journalists in prison...

Economics:

- Stagflation + unemployment + increasing debts + low credit rating (Fitch and Moodys) + increasing taxes + considerable reducation in public investments + inadequately big state budget + random shortages touching some products (local production is doing down simultanously with reduction in imports) + serious agricultural decline + small and medium entreprizes dying in a serious rate

I am a French Canadian currently visiting friends in southern Europe. I have been fascinated Punic history for quite some time, and would like to take the opportunity to come visit in the next few weeks. I do not speak Arabic, fluent in English and French, as well as proficient in Spanish.
Will I piss people off if I speak in French outside of Tunis? I was in Morocco in early 2020 and I was making way more friends speaking in Spanish then French. The reasons are obvious, but I travel to make friends and forge memories.

Also, I’ve always wondered. Do Tunisians use the word Punic to refer to that era of their history? I’m guessing that this word probably came from the Roman’s.","Gotta admit that is a weird misconception that I’ve never heard before. No, you can speak whatever language you want, your French should help you get around the whole country.
And yes that era is referred to as Punic","you can speak french , most of people around 18-27 speak good english, so you won't have a problem regarding languages.

You are not expected to speak any Arabic, but people will welcome your efforts if you try to. Small tip: In Tunisia we don't speak standard Arabic, we speak the Tunisian Dialect, not that anyone would be offended if you tried standard, but it is not common.

For Punic history, first, we use more Carthaginian instead of Punic, except for the wars, they are called Punic wars, as you said, Punic is a Roman word, which I think (not sure) means Phoenician, may be Romans never wanted to acknowledge the distinction between the two civilization, or may be they were never considered as distinct and that Carthaginian empire was a continuity of the Phoenician civilisation, I don't know. Second, you may be a little disappointed about the historic sites that go back to the Punic era, especially in Carthage, as most of it was destroyed by the Romans when they invaded, or built over.

I'm realizing how tough the dating world is once you start having a job.  
Especially when you have little to no time for meeting new people, or for side activities.

Post-Uni, My ""Social Circle"" shrunk to just a handful of friends, with whom I hang out occasionally.

Recently I've been looking for a serious relationship. That's when the realization hit me **""HOW THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO FIND A PARTNER?""**

I'm living in a city fi ""Janoub"" where let's say... meeting new girls is not that accessible.

I'm not so stocked about Dating Apps since it feels like most people are there for fun. After all, who the hell will go on Tinder looking for a partner?  
Nor I'm pumped about Social Media, since it feels like there's a barrier between you and reaching out to a person you don't know.

I'm at a point where I'm even thinking of moving out to a new place just for the sake of meeting new girls!

So my questions are (for both Men and Women)

1. How would you go about finding a partner these days?
2. How much effort/time would you invest in finding a partner?
3. Would you bother moving out to a new place just for the sake of dating?",Lbnet yjiw wahadhom just live your life brother,"1) I'd focus more on doing social activities I enjoy in order to meet people alike. If that's not possible I'd ask my friends to introduce me to their friends to broaden my circle a bit. Or just generally get out of your comfort zone and put yourself out there.. 

2) if it's that important to me, I'd put as much effort and time needed to reach it. By reach it I don't just mean finding a partner but rather finding and keeping the partner. 

3) I wouldn't bother moving out just for the sake of dating. I would however do so in pursuit of a better future career wise. Better environment, better surroundings, better services and standards of living etc.. for one's well-being. Which shouldn't depend on a partner.","> the realization hit me [""HOW THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO FIND A PARTNER?](https://youtu.be/fNSNjeRyUhI?t=34)**""**","The traditional way, friends of friends or family brokers lol","This is so relatable.
When I graduated and got a full time job, I was instantly in that isolation.

My circle of friends really shrunk to a small group, who although still close friends, live in other cities. This makes the frequency of hanging out small. I have to wait at least two weeks so I can see a friend. And for that, we have to plan, where and when, unlike random hangouts at uni. I don't wanto make friends with my colleagues, I am getting on well with them but I don't want corporate friends to become friends.

I met someone a couple of months ago, I approached her and we met and talked for some time, and now we are dating.

Btw people in Algeria don’t make 3-4000 dinar very few do it’s just the ideal wage that would live you good. That is attainable.


Could you also include if your price includes rent or owned house.

You could manage with lower and depending on your lifestyle you might need considerably more. Rent will be your biggest expense. Without knowing what your lifestyle is like, I can't really give a good answer.

Also, keep in mind that the Tunisian dinar is stronger than the algerian one.
 1 Tunisian Dinar is 40 Algerian. Don't make comparisons without taking that into account.","What do you mean don’t forget to take it into account. the 3-4000 thousand was in Tunisian dinar not Algeria in Algeria it would be 20million/200000dzd.  Or did u mean something else

I am reaching out to our community in a desperate situation and seeking your support.

I am a Tunisian girl who has been living in France for the past 10 years. Over time, I have worked hard to establish financial stability and build a life for myself. Recently, I encountered a distressing situation involving an abusive relationship. A guy I once loved and trusted, with whom I shared two years of my life and supported him in all possible means, slowly turned out to an abuser. Verbal and physical abuse, surveillance, stalking, and even hacking into my Gmail account, which contains crucial documents.

The situation escalated to the point where he physically attacked me, on many occasions. But the last one was the worse and now he is in prison, and I feel relieved. That night, we had a fight because I said that he must be the one behind my account being hacked. He denied claiming that I'm stupid for trusting in people and that because of me we will have no financial standing because I will be banned frombanks as my documents will be used to get fraudulent bank loans.

This person is now in jail for the harm he caused me, but the aftermath of his actions continues to haunt me. Soon, I'll have to renew my residency card and I need the documents he stole from me.

He set a physical key to prevent me from regaining access. I really don't know what to do.

I am reaching out to our community in the hopes that someone trustworthy might be able to guide me through this process or connect me with the right resources.

If you have any information or can offer assistance, please reach out. Your support means the world to me, and I am grateful for any help you can provide.

Please, I already feel bad enough for having let someone abuse me this way, I don't want to feel guilty for him being bad to me. It is not my fault. I just need help to avoid further loss.","Sorry but this is Gmail you're talking about, I can't think of any ""hacker"" skilled enough to pull this off unless he's with NSA or something.

I've done my research and these are the available options:

* you have a family member who lives abroad who can pay the amount for you - the problem is, I don't have anyone abroad who has that big of an amount of money
* Find someone in Tunsia who would take the money in TND and create the account for you abroad - very risky to give to a stranger that big on an amount
* find a specialized agency - might take a big commission and I didn't find a recommended agency

If you mean the end of all life on earth, that would be after billions of years when the sun becomes a red giant, if no other accidents happen to the planet, probably few millions before that, when the sun becomes too hot for life to exist.

if you mean the end of the universe, well scientists believe this won't happen before a veeeeeery long time (probably infinite time), where every thing will decay and disappear slowly, until all energy is equally distributed through the universe and no energy fluctuation will ever happen (energy fluctuation is needed for any thing to happen in the universe, even the smallest chemical reaction).

Even though I believe in god (or at least I want to) the significance in God is not the same to me anymore. I don't feel the sense if ""fear"" I 'should've be feeling. I don't feel guilt by doing some personal sins anymore. 
I wear Hijab and I am comfortable with it. In fact I can't even imagine removing it at least not now which makes me in debate about myself wether I am being a hypocrite or not.

I know islam is a good religion and it has some good values in its most. It's just the personal feeling and view about it. 
I need your help ❤

Edit: guys I am not here to debate the religion please just keep your opinions about it away from the answer as it's not helping me at all thank you ","Am not going to debate religion here with you, i dont think that is particularly of help, but i can offer maybe hopefully relevant questions, what does religion do for you? Specifically what parts do inspire and help you? As a believer, you seem to have lost the ""awe"" which would inspire fear and guilt and love, and tie down your spirit to its meaning and purpose, spiritually this would be more powerful and harder to put into words, because its an individually intimate experience, to me, religious people (most of em) are no different than atheists, much much less different than they think they are, because they both have no sense of that experience that makes them sensitive to anything beyond themselves, rarely do you sense a soulful person, one who is actually animated, bursts with vitality and life, that is wholly motivated by his own being and his own beliefs and his own spirit, nvm where he gets it from, god or his own ass, he is fearless, and you dont become that way by either knocking shyly at the door of your nihilism, or entering and wallowing there scratching at the walls like a pitiful bug, my point is! Start seeking and Face your fears, if you truly feel like a hypocrite nvm the outcomes, ask and answer your questions and follow the threads to the very end, be discerning and mindful of your own well being, and pay heed to the green areas where you feel you can work with/in (that would be looking out for the principles and values you do treasure about islam or outside of islam or wherever,) but have courage and take this seriously if you seriously mean it that you want to attempt to further understand your world and spirit, there isnt really much else to do, sweeping things under the rug would be giving up!!

So clearly, there is no lack in the sense of criticism, at least we know that our ""bad thing"" detector is working. 

&nbsp; 

But how will it be fixed in practice ?

I want to share an example of something that 100% effect us all. 

(it will one day in the future if it didn't effect you yet)

And it's a thing that doesn't have *ANY* external factors to justify our failure to fix it, 

the problem is:



#Incridibly bad administrative service for trivial problems:

So today u/Disastrous-Cash-2786 posted [Tunisia must be decentralized](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/19386f4/tunisia_must_be_decentralized/), and the TL;DR is : 

why does someone from Gafsa sometimes need to go all the way to Tunis (capital) to get a piece of paper (an official document) ? 

despite the following simple facts: 

* The information of that paper is owned by the government

 * digitalized or paper form should not matter

* The mean to send that document to him are available.
 * internet, fax, post

&nbsp;

here is a real example cause in the ""decentralized post"" there were comments from people who had no idea about this lol


----

My wife was born in Tunis, but she lived in Bizerte since she was 5 years old. 

when she wanted to make a passport for the first time, a birth certificate in French was required. 

In order to get that birth certificate: 

* **she has to go to the Paladeya of the capital in which her parents registered her in 1995, and ask for a first-time birth-certificate in french**

* Once they give it to her once in Tunis

* She can get from anywhere else in the country

So for her case, the effort needed to make a passport, had an extra bonus step of going from Bizerte to Tunis. 

Now imagine if she was born in Tunis but lived in a much further city..
----

&nbsp; 

#Eliminating the usual ""suspects"" 

When most people think about this, they immediately use the word ""bureaucracy"", even in Tv they use the same word, ""we have a very bad bureaucracy"".

Which is a fallacy, bureaucracy in itself is not a ""bad word"", it is essentially an administrative system designed to help the system-owner to succeed and achieve the pre-designed goal.

That goal can be ""money"" for business, it can be a title/medal for sport team, or it can be overall growth and development for governments. 

&nbsp;

So the first thing we need to understand before deciding whether we have a bad bureaucracy or not, is to investigate whether the goal we have aligns with the current bureaucracy we have or not. 

&nbsp;

#So what is the goal and what's wrong with it ?

In the case of the ""official document"" the goal is incredibly clear. 

The government setup a system that should provide a service to the citizens. 

And in theory, this service is already being paid for by the citizens. 

Also in theory, All citizens are paying the same prices according to the tax-brackets agreement we have.

&nbsp;

So in theory, if I in Bizerte paid the government 100dt this year for its service, I should get the same service and spend the same effort as someone who paid the same 100dt in another city. 

&nbsp;

But what is really happening is: 

* Someone from Bizerte pays 100dt and get 70% of the service.

* Someone from Gafsa pays 100dt and gets 30% of the service. 

* Someone from the capital pays 100dt and gets 100% of the service.

&nbsp;

This is clearly a problem, in a business environment this would be considered a failure, since the product provider (government) completely failed to satisfy their clients (Citizens). 

If this happens once or twice, then it will be considered a failure.

If it happens again, the clients will look for another product provider. 

&nbsp;

But in our case, the problem that we have, is that this ""failure"" has been happening for *YEARS*,  everybody knows it, and we just accept it now and complain about it later (am not pointing the blame to anyone, am just like you). 


&nbsp; 

considering that last part, maybe we should actually double-check on the original goal of the product provider ? did they *REALLY* setup a service for us for the unique purpose of that or is there something else ?

&nbsp;

#The ""something else""

There is no conspiracy, no mal-intent, no genius evil rich old guys sitting in a round table plotting on how to make Fawzi waste 3 days of his life chasing a document between Beja and the capital.

I seriously don't believe that. 

Instead, what we have is layers and layers of mismanagement, bad decision and to put it bluntly: a shitload of incompetent decision-makers surrounded by tons of lazy and careless مسمار في حيط employees. 

&nbsp;

And that's, the reason why me and you have to go to a complete different city to get a document is because: 

1. the مسمار في حيط don't want to spend effort doing email work
 * this will significantly increase their workload 

2. The decision-makers are too blind to make this trivial change a priority.

3. The people don't give a fuck, until they themeselves face the problem.
 * but at that point is too late already, so they deal with it, complain and forget about it.  




&nbsp;

And that is the whole loop, we've been locked there for years.

We think these trivial problems will get fixed automatically if somehow, we magically become rich, which is totally wrong, more money won't achieve anything, the administration already has an overload of employees so there is no real lack of resources there. 


&nbsp;

Waiting for more money to fix this problem is like waiting to move from your tiny house in the poor-neighborhood to a big nice house in the nouveau-rich zone, *just to fix a broken window in the current tiny house* !!

Do you see it xD ? 

* Request:  ""Fix the window, its causing rain and dust to come in 24h/7""

* Reply: ""meh, we will do it in our future awesome house""

* 2 minutes later after it rains: ""FUCK THIS STUPID WINDOW!! AGHH!!"" 



&nbsp;

#Solution

The optimistic (and naive) one is to hope that the newer generation will be more loud about this, that maybe they will organize monthly complaints or something about the problems that don't need any extra resources to be fixed. 

And if they don't fix it, then there should be consequences, like bigger manifestations, or boycotting or whatever, but the consequences *NEED* to effect the party that didn't fulfil its promises, and no, election will *NEVER* solve this in any country similar to us. 

With the current state of Tunisia, that loop will never break, and staying in that loop will guarantee remaining in this state which will keep the loop going. 

&nbsp;

Is it impossible for example to organize a *COUNTRY-WIDE* movement among all university student to not register in the beginning of the year, until the government announce that no citizen from any city need to travel to any other city get a stamped piece of paper ? 


&nbsp;

No violence, no interaction with the cops, and a national (or even international) media coverage is almost guaranteed.


&nbsp;

And if the end result is that the government ignores these demands, knowing that there is no significant extra resources are needed, then obviously the government goals do not align with your (the citizens) interests. 


&nbsp;

And in this case, the other citizens should join in, and if they don't, then obviously their goals do not align with yours. 


&nbsp;

And in that case, you're on your own and you better stop hoping for any national improvement and just focus on individual improvement, consider your ""contract"" with that country a mean to an end, and juts move on.


&nbsp; 


#Remark: 

This whole way of thinking is honestly a bit new to me, lately i've been following (and researching) about how the citizens of the ""rich countries"" get their demands done, either by elections, protesting, boycotting or [even direct violence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLjToexLzPw), and the level of their ""citizenship practices"" is as far from us as the UEFA Champions League Vs الرابطة المحترفة الٱولى. 

We should not see this as an insult, or consider it an inferiority complex or anything.  Its nothing more than an opportunity to learn and improve.

&nbsp;

PS:

I flaired the post as ""culture"" instead of ""politics"" in purpose, 

We have an incredibly bad politics because we don't have the culture of taking what we are owed.","I will say the quiet part loudly: The Government is avoiding/postponing going full digital because 100ks of employees will become redundant overnight and that will trigger a domino effect of loan defaults and bankrupt the social security systems ending our سلم اجتماعي. 

In 15 years, the most of our administration will retire and hopefully, then, we can get an EGov.

\- unexpected amount of people migrated from inner/smaller cities to the capital and other big cities  which made it way above the capacity( not blaming them because, due to issue 1, the goverments since independance didn't even try to make major big cities in the inner part amd improve their armenities,needs and infrastructure)

&#x200B;

But if you look till modern history Tunisia was well maintained, from carthage, to the arabic /turkish era, famma systeme watha, the center, madina aati9a, the streets etc.. even during the french period, there are metro stations and big streets that were created ( metro, train, big streets area like hbib borguiba).

After that,unfortunatlym they create new areas independantly instead of reforming and modernize the existing ones, plus the issues i mentionned above.","Tunisian chaos city planning is pure shit, but this post is incredibly misleading...

The scale and number of houses is probably wrong, the image is just an imagination by an artist (or someone using a tool to draw fantasy maps).

Roma peak population (In main-land rome alone (Italy)) was between 500k and 1 million.

I studied for years with sfaxians and either my classmates or not, my sfa9 friends were really brilliant, passed their bac with impressive results (you know 20.25), at university they still did impressive work (ghalew 3lina l khobz bel tma7rith) and got honorable marks.

At work, shortly, it's been the same. 
Efforts. Results.

My only conclusion is that sfaxians are really commited and determined. And I knew from them that is common in almost all families.
We cannot deny the important weight of Sfax and its contribution to the Tunisian economy.

What if All Tunisians worked with such work ethics?

Please let me know, I might have missed details or events that led to that, or if it is by coincidence that almost all sfaxians I met shared these qualities.","Look, I am not generalising, and I do not wish to perpetuate any negative stereotypes about any group of people. What follows is based on my own personal experiences with the majority of Sfaxian people I have encountered. It's crucial to recognise that individuals within any group can vary widely, and my observations are specific to certain encounters, not applying to all individuals from Sfax.


I have spent my entire life in Tunis, but I worked in an environment where approximately 50% of the employees were from Sfax or had Sfaxian backgrounds. Similarly, during my time at the pioneer high school (Lycée Pilote Bourguiba), a significant portion of my classmates were also Sfaxian. Not to mention the few friends that I have. From these interactions over the years, I noticed certain patterns.


First, they are good with finances and money management, which have been ingrained in them generation after generation within their own families since childhood. Secondly, Sfaxian families are generally highly competitive, pushing themselves to be the best among their peers and pushing their children to take school very seriously, achieve high scores, and pursue prestigious, high-paying careers.
This competitive environment, however, can create frustration and pressure especially among younger people which is something they express to their friends but never dare to speak to their families. Young women might find this especially frustrating since it can even go to the extent of impacting their private love life and turning into pressure to marry young into a wealthy Sfaxian family.


I have also observed what I perceive as malicious and cunning behaviours in most of them. They use ruses and tricks, lying straight to your face to get what they want. They have no genuine friends and find no problem using people to achieve their goals. They tend to take more than they give, even in simple matters.

While there seems to be a prioritisation of personal interests over genuine connections with others, this is not the case when dealing with fellow Sfaxians. Favouritism within their community is clear, not only in personal choices but also in professional settings, where certain individuals receive preferential treatment and more opportunities solely because they are also Sfaxian. This favouritism contributes to their success.


A few examples illustrate this point: I had a Sfaxian coworker who insisted on going back to Sfax for a simple dentist appointment, refusing an excellent one in Tunis. They strictly believe in using services and making purchases only from fellow Sfaxians.
A Sfaxian boss favoured our Sfaxian coworker, granting them more privileges than the rest of us.
In school, teachers paid more attention to students with typical Sfaxian family names (Kammoun, Hachicha, Besbes, Fakhfekh, etc.), possibly influenced by the fact that many teachers at Lycée Pilote come from Sfax.
In my workplace, most directors and higher-ups are Sfaxian, often favouring fellow Sfaxians for positions, even if objectively better candidates were available. It sometimes feels like a regional internal conflict, reaching a ridiculous extent.


I am not saying they're not hardworking, but from what I observed, some are and some aren't. The majority of the most hard working people I ever had the chance to work with were not from Sfax. Some Sfaxians are brilliant, and some are average, which is really much like anywhere else. My perception is that they are under significant pressure and highly competitive people who care a lot about their own image within their community, which leans them toward excelling academically and professionally.","Me a very lazy sfaxian:

Becoming a hard worker is the outcome of self-development, and in our  context, Sfax serves as the ""catalyst"" for this development. Instead of  immediately suggesting, ""Why don't we apply Sfaxian work ethics to  everyone?""  consider  a reasonable  exploration: ""Why does being raised in Sfax increase the  likelihood of being a hard worker?"" u'll have to delve into the  historical, cultural, and economic factors that create an environment  conducive to produce ""Hard worker"" individuals. { Hedi Timoumi's insights are  invaluable for understanding this phenomenon }.

Tunisia's position is very clear about this conflict and it's already affecting the ties between the us and europe and as sad as it is, Tunisia's very financially dependent on these two so the government is trying to play this safe, on one hand support Palestine and on the other try to maintain steady relations with us/europe.","Because the human in power is selling slogans to the sheeps and has no actual plans to achieve anything he says.

A colleague, although she joined one year earlier, was assigned by the manager to provide us with assistance since we were new. The first couple of months were horrible with her. She was patronizing and judgemental of the quality of my work even when the manager appreciates my code, gossiping, she'd said it has something lacking or not persistent. The other new colleague and I were really pissed, and soon altercations started. I've been trying to tell her to fuck off in the most professional way, refused to backup her when she was not available, which she took personally. Also I didn't hesitate to report to the manager in the 1-2-1 evaluation sessions.

Soon enough, the manager separated us, it's been a year now, any discussion between us that doesn't concern work wouldn't exceed ""bonjour"".

So bro, my advice is to keep ignoring her, tell her to fuck off in a professional way (I have urgent deadlines, I can't assist with you I have tight timeline. Don't hesitate to report to the boss the personal actions she's commiting and that she's treating you in an intimidating way.

Corporate culture is toxic and many people want to patronize.","Start doing it back to her.

I started a new job last year and on my first day this coworker came to me and said « you will be reporting to me and I am your manager » ama hiya she is not my manager at all, she is just more senior than me and we work on the same project. I didn’t say anything since it was my first day and I didn’t want any trouble yet. She spent the first few weeks assigning me tasks that she should be doing and other things not in my job description (photocopies, 9ahwa, etc.) until my actual manager came from abroad (she is the regional director and lives in another country and comes to Tunisia a few times a year). I asked to sit down with her and asked her « who is my actual manager and who is allowed to assign tasks to me? Is it ´coworker name ‘? And from there we started a discussion that led to my manager privately asking my coworker to stop bothering me.
From time to time this coworker still tries to be disrespectful to me and I just brush it off and say no gently and ignore her.
My main advice to you is don’t cause a scene in a professional setting as it might badly reflect with your managers, if it goes too far privately talk to your coworker and say that you are not comfortable with the way she talks to you. It neither of these work, ask for an informal meeting with your manager and share your grievances but always be the better person. Here’s a example of what you can say to your manager « I’m happy to be part of the team and work but sometimes there are challenges dealing with some coworkers. While I cannot cross boundaries with these people, is it possible for you to step in »
Some companies (like mine) have an HR department that can mediate conflicts in a healthy manner, in encourage you to report any discomfort to them.","Sorry, brother, but it's your fault.

In the beginning, she asked you to bring her things and you did, so that's what set the dynamic of your relationship with her.

From now on, don't do anything unless it's in writing and from your supervisor. That's the way it should be.

If you don't set boundaries from the start, they will run all over you. And if you try to set them in the future, it'll be seen as a challenge and an act of rebellion.

1955zrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1955zrf/kais_saied_lied_to_you_about_coffee_shortages_and/,10,Kais Saied lied to you about coffee shortages and just admitted it,"In my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/191x84r/very_simple_proof_that_kais_saied_lies_about/), I said that Kais Saied and his regime lie about shortages blaming them on distribution when they intentionally reduced imports at levels that would 100% cause shortages and they knew that.

Here's Kais Saied talking about how they imported enough coffee (and sugar) and how the shortages are because people are hiding this to plot against him: [Video at 1:00](https://youtu.be/JEjAGsjQI-Q?t=60)

To restate [stats](https://imgur.com/a/xNOCRtE) I mentioned in the last post, coffee imports in the first 9 months of 2023 vs 2022 went down from 24400 tons to 2800 tons. In other words, for every 10kg of coffee imported in 2022 we only imported about 1kg in 2023 so this is a very significant drop, one that will absolutely lead to shortages.

Today, Kais Saied talked about coffee specifically and actually ended up exposing his lies.

Starting from [12:20](https://youtu.be/DjDQeWQauRI?t=740), Saied talks about how OCT (diwen tijara) needed to borrow 70m dollars in June 2022 (217m dinars). I'll address the conspiracy theory that follows but this right here is the most important admission of guilt. This purchase alone in 2022 is 8 times more than they spent on coffee in 2023 (34m dinars). If the president thinks not importing it in 2022 was a problem then why did we continue importing 10 times less overall in 2023, why does he not talk about 2023 and 2024? Why did he continue to claim they imported enough and that the issue was distribution? Why did they go around arresting people with 10 bags in their basement and saying it will solve the issue?

So even though it's clear there's financial pressures within OCT that Saied basically ends up exposing himself and that the government budget clearly shows (extreme reduction in money spent on subsidies) and also the regime boasts about reducing imports, let's say Saied's story about this cheque is true and it was hidden because of a conspiracy, what is happening in 2023 and now in 2024 for imports to actually even significantly go went down since 2022?

To summarize, even if this convoluted story is true, it actually shows Saied was lying about importing enough on top of showing he's completely incompetent for somehow not resolving this in 3 years despite having unmatched power.","brace yourself, kais' dick riders are coming.","I'll address the conspiracy in this comment to not distract from my main point and feed into Saied intentional muddying of water.

At [14:30](https://youtu.be/DjDQeWQauRI?t=865), Saied mentions a key information that the money that was supposed to be used as guarantee for the loan was sent to the state owned sugar company (Société tunisienne du sucre). It's apparently shocking to the president despite him personally pushing to fund this state company first of all and more importantly this clearly shows that there was a decision to be made between coffee and sugar, both having shortages at the time. This of course contradicts the president's claim in the video above at the coffeeshop when asked about sugar and coffee shortages.

On the other hand, the claim that the cheque from Bank Isken was the issue is vague at best. The president says it's a cheque not a bank draft so it's not clear whether the money was available afterwards. More importantly at [17:00](https://youtu.be/DjDQeWQauRI?t=1018) Saied mentions that money was taken out instead of going into the Amen bank account and that obviously will make Amen Bank say that OCT was not serious. They needed the money somewhere else and this proves there was indeed financial difficulties contrary to what the president follows up with at [18:38](https://youtu.be/DjDQeWQauRI?t=1117) saying the money was there. Finally, after talking about what is clearly financial and import issues for 10min, Saied concludes that [18:45](https://youtu.be/DjDQeWQauRI?t=1125) that the issue is with distribution and e7tikar.","If there's something I learned from anything is that people don't care about facts, they only care about what make them comfortable,ie standing with KS from 2022,quit politics, you'll live longer","So they tried to import less of ""the nonessential products"" but lied to the public about the reasons of the shortages? Am l getting that right?

And what are they trying to achieve with that ? Can someone explain to me. Op probably explained everything but I got too confused sorry","I have a question, the import reduce in 2023 couldn't be due to monopolies ? maybe the government knows that there is huge stock not distributed to people ?",2024-01-12 21:13:38

I'm flying out to Sousse for a week to celebrate my birthday and I cannot WAIT to come and visit your beautiful country. I'm a woman and I'm 38, soon to be 39.

I had a couple of questions, if that's OK! 

I'm a very conservative dresser (long sleeves and harem pants most of the time), so I should be OK in most spaces? I do plan to visit a mosque, so will cover my hair. Will that be OK? 

I speak some very basic French, will that be preferable to speaking English? I can just about get by.

Is it likely to be quite warm? It's currently 3 degrees in Dorset and I'm dying for some sunshine. 15 degrees would feel beautiful right now. 

Is there anything else i should know? 

Thank you so much in advance for your help and advice. I want to enjoy my holiday and respect your customs at the same time as much as possible.","You can wear whatever you want just nothing toooo revealing for your own safety ofc. 

People understand French more than English in a lot of cities or communities, like hotels will probably understand English, but on the street when talking to people speak in French.

Get some imodium from any pharmacy here because if you're not used to spicy food your stomach wouldn't be able to handle it right away. 

And like any other destination try to keep your belongings safe and close to you. 

Oh and you can definitely haggle with the vendors if you're planning to go to the Medina de Sousse to buy traditional items or clothes, because they tend to inflate the prices for tourists. 

Hope you enjoy your trip 😁",I'll be with my husband. Sorry. Should have said that!,"You don’t necessarily have to be a modest dresser, you’re safe eitherways.

Yes when visiting a mosque you’ll be asked to cover your hair when inside the mosque. 

French would be preferred. But some do speak English also.

However, the procedure is both time-consuming and expensive. For instance, the theoretical part, known as CODE in Tunisia, requires mandatory attendance of 14 hours of classes, at a rate of maximum 2 hours a week. Due to my busy schedule with work and studies, attending these classes every week is challenging.

To expedite the process, I'm considering obtaining my driving license in Tunisia during my upcoming vacation. My brother recently obtained his license there, and it only took him one month, making it a more feasible option for me. Is there a way for me to use my Tunisian license to drive in Germany for a longer duration, beyond the standard six months?","It’s simple when you do your Tunisian licence they’re not gonna accept it if you’re living in Germany after 3 months there you have to get a German licence cuz they think (and it’s true 😅) that you can just buy it in Tunisia or other countries that are similar

- Get Tunisian license
- Once in germany, do a Umschreibung einer ausländischen Fahrerlaubnis in your closest Bürgeramt.
- Go to a driving school and tell them you want to do an Umschreibung. This means:
   - No need for a minimum amount of hours.
   - No need for theory hours, you can just study by yourself and go do the exam.
   - The instructor will take you on one hour to see where youre at in practice. If youre really lucky/good they can request the exam for you right away. I needed like 5 hours though.

It should be taken promptly, ideally within 12 hours after unprotected or poorly protected intercourse, and generally no later than 72 hours (3 days) after sexual activity.

It's crucial to recognise that emergency contraception is an exceptional solution, not intended for regular use. Frequent reliance on it can have side effects on your partner and may also disrupt her menstrual cycle.

So, if you're considering more unprotected intercourse, it's only responsible to explore alternative, more sustainable contraceptive methods that allow both of you to share responsibility for contraception and its implications.","You can ask for Plan B, they know it, sinon ask for Ella One or Norlevo.",Keep in mind the efficiency [of those depends on the weight of the person](https://www.ohsu.edu/womens-health/does-morning-after-pill-work-high-bmi-women),In Tunisia you can just go to the pharmacy and ask for « pillule du lendemain » and they will give you what you need.,"She can just go the pharmacy explain the situation and ask for the pill (and suffer the judgement may be).

General advice, you have to be more responsible than this, and use some kind of contraceptive solution (there are many), the obvious one is the daily pill, but if she is trying to hide this from her entourage, she might get in trouble if someone stumble upon them, plus they have side effects on fertility, specially if she uses them for a long time, so she needs to check with a doctor, obviously, if we are still trying to keep it a secret, don't go to a doctor where you can meet people you know (doctors have to keep your situation secret, it is the law, and they can't just divulge that to the family, if she is not a minor). There is also the IUD (stérilet) that can be installed by a doctor, but just don't forget about it if we are still keeping this secret, and she has to undergo an X ray scan, it shows in X Rays. Keep in mind that all these are not 100% efficient.

If you are not exclusive, you must use protection, and this should not be debatable.

And on a side note, if you choose not to use any contraceptive solution, and count on the regularity of her menstrual cycle, let me present you to 4 of my (married) friends who had accidental pregnancies even though they were very careful and organised and had very regular cycles.

Good luck",2024-01-12 12:37:25

Hey guys, I'm a shy guy, I saw once a cool girl on the street and thought she'd be awesome to get to know, but I always hesitate in this kind of situation, I worry about coming across as creepy or disrespectful in this kind of situation. 

I know we all want to connect and find love, but approaching women in public can be tricky, especially in our cultural context. So, I'm curious, what are your tips and recommendations for a man to win a Tunisian girl's trust when making an introduction in a non-confrontational way?

Here are some specific things I'm wondering:

What kind of approach feels least intrusive or intimidating? Is it better to start with a compliment, a question, or just a friendly hello?

How can I show genuine interest without giving off stalker vibes? Is it okay to ask for her number right away, or should I take things slower?

I'm not looking for pick-up lines or cheesy tricks. I genuinely want to learn how to connect with women in a respectful and appropriate way.

So, Tunisian ladies, let your wisdom flow! Any advice you have for us clueless guys would be greatly appreciated.

If you have any funny stories or successful approaches you've used, feel free to share them too! We'd all love to hear!

[Edit] I know that this is usually how things are in Reddit but it's sad to see all of these unrelated comments. Anyway, THANKS so much to everyone who took the question seriously and responded with thoughtful and honest advice! 

I think you're all right, being upfront and honest ( in a respectful way of course) is probably a nice thing to do. I guess being emotional at that moment was definitely clouding my judgement. Starting with a smile and a kind greeting, seems like such a natural way to break the ice. 

Maybe I need to stop overthinking and work on my confidence. This is definitely something I need to improve.","Going up to a stranger on the street is a bit tricky but I’d say walk up to her, give a simple compliment, proceed by telling her your name or introducing yourself, and say that you’d love to get to know her or hang out sometime if she’s up for it. I guess giving her your instagram or social media rather than asking for hers might be a better idea so then she doesn’t feel pressured. If she’s into the idea then she can follow you on there. 
Make this interaction short (and not awkward, be confident and friendly), tell her to have a good day and that you hope to talk to her soon, and go on with the rest of your day.","try ""waaa, chbi louz manbouz ?""","follow her at night, if she starts walking faster then walk faster, if she runs YOU RUN, CATCH HER AND PUT HER IN A VAN NOW",">Hey guys, I’m a shy guy

If a guy has some deep need to approach me I prefer simple ""hello, sorry to bother you but I wanted to give you my Instagram and maybe we can get to know each other"" If you want to add the reason like you thought she was pretty or had a nice smile you can try this but if you're an awkward person it can come off as creepy.

This gives the girl the control over if she wants to follow you. If she adds you, then this is your opportunity to message her.

I do not give my phone number to anyone ever, and most girls won't.


If you want to meet girls in an organic way then go to the language meet ups or the social gathering meetups where they play boardgames.

I only know of one in tunis but other cities must have these things too. They usually have whatsapp groups and fb and Instagram pages and this means interacting with girls in the group and in person so you can get to know each other first.",2024-01-12 09:00:25

And I would love any advice on what to see as someone interested in food, art, nature, history, architecture, language, dancing, and music. I’d also like to connect with local people and learn about what it means to be Tunisian!

EDIT: reading the kindness and warmth from these answers alone has me so excited to visit. If ANY of y’all are planning to visit New York, please let me know so I can return the favor!!! ",I know the country is probably diverse - my first stop will be Tunis but I’d love to know about places beyond that as well,"That sounds like a fantastic opportunity, welcome to Tunisia!


* **To be respectful of the culture:** 
It's advisable to dress modestly, but that usually applies in more traditional and conservative areas.



* **Engaging with the queer community:**
This may require discretion, as attitudes can vary. While there might not be specific venues openly catering to the queer community, exploring more liberal and urban areas in Tunis could increase the chances of meeting them. Approach these interactions with respect for privacy, as not everyone may feel comfortable openly discussing their sexual orientation.




* **Rich Culinary scene:**


1. The local cuisine: here are some of our best and popular streetfood which are cheap and mouthwatering: kafteji, ojja merguez (merguez is traditional Tunisian suasages), lablebi (very good for cold weathers), brik, fricassé, chapati (while the Indian chapati is a roti/bread, this one is like whole sandwich with round and thicker and fluffier bread), mlewi, mtabga, sehan tounsi, etc. You can find this pretty much anywhere especially in downtown Tunis.

You can go to fancier restaurants which can be more expensive but the setting is very beautiful. They offer a variety of traditional food like couscous, soups, stews, salads, tajines, and we also have a wide variety of pasta dishes (Tunisians are fond of it and the second-largest consumers of pasta globally, following Italy) etc. I suggest going to the Medina (downtown Tunis) to restaurants like Al Ali, Dar el Jeld etc. Try places in Sidi Bou Said, La Goulette, or Soukra.

Tunisian cuisine has a nice blend of Mediterranean European influence (France and Italy), North African Amazigh cuisine and a bit of Levant and Turkish influence. Beware that our food is usually spicy, and we consume lots of tuna, eggs and seafood.

2. Sweets: you're in for a treat! We have amazing pastry influenced by the Europeans in most pastries. You can find croissants , mille-feuilles, pains au chocolat, bûches, éclairs, Paris-Brest, Galette des rois, macarons, schneks, and different types of puff pastry. I suggest Eric Kayser, Madeleine & Proust, Le Gourmet, Gourmandise, Pavlova. You can use Google Maps to find nice pastry shops especially around La Marsa, Jardins de Carthage, they're the best.

Tunisian traditional sweets are something else and definitely a must-try. We have maqroudh, kaak, baklava, yoo-yoo, different puddings etc. You can get these in El Medina of Tunis but also in some popular pastry shops like Madame Masmoudi, Gourmandise etc. Btw we have Mkhareq (Tunisian version of the Indian Gulab Jamun but we do them in the shape of a donut), Jalabi too which are called Zlabia here. Both are best bought from Beja (North West of the country).



* **Historical sites:** here is [a list of some archaeological sites](https://www.tunisiepatrimoine.tn/en/sites/) and these are a few less-known ones in the North West of the country [here](https://wildyness.com/news/archaeological-sites-unknown-tunisia). My favourites are Carthage, Bulla Regia and El Jem. You definitely have to visit el Jem amphitheatre! Not only is it [one of the best preserved Roman stone ruins in the world, it is also one of the biggest amphitheatres in the world](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphitheatre_of_El_Jem). Many scenes of the Oscar winning movie The Gladiator were filmed there. Speaking of movies, Tunisia is also where several scenes from the origin Star Wars trilogy were filmed. Fun fact, the name Tatooine comes from the name Tataouine which is a region in the South of Tunisia. The set is still there and people go visit it to take photos.


It is important to note that the experience in Tunisia is different than in other archaeological sites in Europe for example because the place won't be crowded with tourists and you have access to the whole place to free roam without barriers which offers a lot more intimate and special visit.

Next to most archaeological sites, you find a dedicated museum in which they store artifacts excavated from there. However, I think you definitely have to visit the Bardo National museum (Tunis) which has a nice collection of interesting artifacts. Even though we are a relatively small country, our history and culture have been influenced by the Amazigh, the Numidian, the Punic/Carthaginian, Romans, Arabs, Ottoman Turcs, the Moors, the French, the Italians, the Jews. You can see it in our food, architecture, traditional clothes, historical sites etc in varying degrees in different places. I am sure there are other places which I failed to mention in the south of the country for example.


* **For cultural events and the art scene:** you can seek information on the internet like [here](https://www.haya-mag.com/date/et-apres) or look for them through Facebook. There are nice art galleries in Sidi Bousaid, la Medina de Tunis, look for what they have next in the program in Theatre Municipal (Downtown Tunis), some restaurants and bars offer special events for music, poetry reading, dancing etc, so make sure to check that. Some hotels also do expositions and cultural events.



Tunisian hospitality is notable, so engaging with people openly and respectfully can lead to meaningful connections and rich exchanges. Please feel free to contact me if you have a specific question or need further assistance. I hope you enjoy it here!","Tunisians are very welcoming people and generous with tourists. For foody people, Tunisia has impeccable and diverse cuisine. It is mostly warm all the year, often so cold for a week or too during winter, often too hot for a week or two in the summer. A natural piece of art. An open air museum with its historical sites.

PS: LGBQT community live in the shadows in Tunisia, although we do not have any issues with them, maybe because in the previous years they were oppressed by bullies and police.","Happy for your visit. for the respect I don't think you will have any problems, Tunisians don't dress overly conservative, they dress in lots of different ways and you are coming in winter so I don't think it will be a problem.

Have you ever watched the movie ""Cool Runnings,"" which tells the story of Jamaica's bobsleigh team qualifying and competing in the 1988 Winter Olympics? It seems that this story has inspired individuals in our lovely country, Tunisia, as they embarked on a journey 18 months ago to qualify three athletes for the 2024 Youth Winter Olympics in Gangwon, Korea, scheduled between January 19 and February 2, 2024.

Tunisia, through its National Olympic Committee, became a member of the International Federation of Bobsleigh and Skeleton this year. It successfully secured national and international support to back the dream of Jonathan Lorimi (Tunisian-Swedish), Baya Mokrani (Tunisian-French), and Sophie Grabel (Tunisian-German) in achieving this dream.

The qualification process for the Youth Winter Olympics in the sport of bobsleigh is not easy. The qualification system requires each athlete to successfully complete 8 out of 10 possible races during their participation in qualifying events from February to December 2023.

After preparatory training camps and participation in events earlier this year in South Korea and the United States, the upcoming period will witness intensive participation by the three athletes to ensure qualification in Norway between October 21 and 29, South Korea between November 2 and 10, and Austria between December 3 and 9, 2023.

Life is quite hard in Tunisia, even for people coming from Western Europe that's not as cheap as before.  And i'm not even talking about healhcare, if really you wanna have access to some decent service, you'll have to pay for it. So 280€ sounds very very low.

Then, regarding religion, a lot of Tunisians are very liberal. Sure Tunisia is still more muslim than your average western country (people grew up with muslim traditions, you hear the azan, that someones prays is a very basic thing...), so if you just wanna find a country where you can be ""invisible"" as a practicing muslim, Tunisia is fine.

My partner and I will be travelling to Tunisia for the first time this May, we are staying in Bouficha.

I’m just researching things to do etc but I’d really love some recommendations!

We love history and love trying local food.

I also love trying to learn a few phrases before travelling to a country… am I right to say Arabic is the national language?

Thank you!","If u want to taste traditional food , u need to visit Tunis , the capital , Bouficha isn t really known for it s food , and yes we talk arabic mixed with old north africans language .",This question is quite common so I recommend searching this sub. There are numerous fantastic recommendations and places to visit shared by fellow members that might suit your interests.,"If you are at bouficha you can visi the zoo there 
Visite the amusement park at Carthage land 
Visite dido bousaid in Tunis ","You’re right about the official language but keep in mind that you will hear the tunisian dialect which is  different to rest of the arabic dialects ( each country have its own dialect ) . I recommend that toy rent a car for the while stay so it will make it much easier to move around and make as much as possible for the whole vacation . Bouficha is practical choice because it’s in center of the major cities ( the capitol , nabeul , hammamet , sousse) . 
Here’s my recommandation for historical sites: eljam , carthage , utique , binzart , doga , medina tunis , medina hammet , medina sousse , sidi bousaid tunis , zaghouan… there is a lot more check on google to get a full list of all the historical sites .
My advice for the food : stay away from the fancy restaurants when your trying to try local traditional food, their prices are over the roof for nothing . 
One traditional dish won’t cost more than 15  dinars at highest . If there price is higher then it’s a sh*t deal.","I don't know why you are staying in Bouficha, it's a small town where u can find basic things but no places for entertainment. but there is Hammamet sud , it's very close to bouficha where you can find everything, from hotels, fancy restaurants, an attraction parc called carthage land and good beaches. If u're staying for a short period try to visit places around Nabeul (like North Hammamet Tower,traditional Medina of hammamet and nabeul , if you want a natural place you can go to ""dar selma"" , the road is not good but the view is amazing) i hope you enjoy your stay",2024-01-13 19:02:32

So I see many people leaving and choosing to work for factories.

Some regions became almost abandoned, especially with forest fires in the summer.
Only the elders stay.

How can the state preserve the agriculture?
How can we invest and convince young people to work in agriculture?",We need to liberate the economy and incentivize the locals to work the land via tax breaks/cuts. Drop all barriers to entry to use agrotech and look at what other nations are doing and learn from them. My 2 cents,"The problem is that the government is subsidizing everything so there is no much to do in terms of controlling cost and controlling earnings by setting the price of the goods as the market demands.
As long as the government having his hands on almost everything (licensing, importing, exporting) it won’t work. It might look it is working at micro scale but at micro scale the numbers don’t add up. Adjusting salaries, opening the market, adding incentives for investment its the only option: yes it is liberal market ideology but it will be fair : you earn money worth your work. You don’t work you dont earn money. The government will be responsible of the health and the security probably education as a stretch. 
The government is not responsible to feed you olive oil and coffee and fucking providing tobacco. 
Its not responsible for providing jobs neither.

I am biologically female.,"Okay I’m just going to assume you’re going to a touristic place on the coast or something (literally your safest option) 

I suppose if your passport says female and you look like a cis man you’d have problems at the airport. (Who’s passport is this, it says female and you’re male, what’s transgender?, cops will come, the whole 9yards) 

On the other hand if you don’t look … very masculine and could still pass as a woman, then I suppose you wouldn’t have problems at the airport but socially people will consider you female, you’d have to use women’s bathroom etc … 

Maybe depending on how you dress and if you keep telling people you’re a man you’d get called slurs or something,

Long story short this is the best case scenario, worst case is probably you going to a conservative area and pissing off random “clochard” simply by existing within his peripheral vision who then decides you have too many unbroken bones and he needs to change that.

I've been pondering a thought lately and wanted to get the diverse perspectives of you guys. I've been noticing the chechia, a traditional Tunisian headwear, and I'm curious to know what you all think about it as a piece of fashion, unrelated to any display of patriotism or cultural identity.

Personally, I find the chechia to be quite classy and charming. I see it as a potential addition to our everyday looks, perhaps even surpassing the popularity of other headwear like bonnets or hats. I believe it has a unique aesthetic appeal that could be promoted more widely.

Do you think the chechia is a stylish and versatile accessory that could enhance our personal style? How do you feel about incorporating it into your wardrobe from a fashion standpoint? I had this thought after seeing someone wearing it in my adventures abroad (they did not look North african/Middle eastern or Turkish to me. They seemed a typical european. I could be wrong though). 

Would appreciate you sharing your opinions and experiences about this matter. Thanks !"," My grandpa, Allah yarahmou, used to look super cool in that chechia. Still miss his style.

**A taste for power**

On July 21, 2025, the streets of the country of Karthagia were filled with chaos and tension. Massive demonstrations erupted as civilians and activists called for the overthrow of North African president Khalil Sidi, elected in 2019 and who had taken advantage of the covid crisis to abolish democracy two years later. He had then established a regime in his own image in which he would be accountable to no one, locking up his opponents, deporting migrants and intimidating the judiciary. By 2021, he was the sole leader of a country with no parliament, no justice system and no political parties.

This austere leader was originally an academic and a lawyer. He came to power in 2019, winning the presidential election by a landslide over a wealthy businessman accused of corruption. At the time, many hoped that the election of a man with such legal experience, a guarantee of probity, would bring positive change to the country. And for the first few years of his presidency, this seemed to be the case. Khalil Sidi promised participatory democracy, a stronger economy, a social state, improved human rights and less corruption. He gained in popularity with the Khartagian people, who saw him as a beacon of hope for their nation.

But over time, Sidi began to show his true colors. It began with his decision to grant himself full powers in 2021, citing the need for stronger leadership during the ongoing pandemic. On Republic Day, he carried out Order 66. Plainclothes soldiers set fire to the offices of the main opposition party. Then, on the advice of Egyptian intelligence officers, he ordered the security forces to lynch the Prime Minister to force him to sign a letter of resignation. The ink had not yet dried when he announced on national television that he was seizing all powers in response to an alleged imminent peril of civil war threatening the country. He immediately dismissed the members of the government and froze the activities of Parliament, claiming that they were hampering the urgent political decisions that needed to be taken. Then, before sunset, he sent tanks into parliament, which was closed until further notice. A month later, he suspended freedom of expression by presidential decree. Many saw this as a clear coup d'état, a flagrant abuse of power by the man they had once trusted.

Things took an even more alarming turn in 2022, when Sidi abrogated the country's democratic constitution, which had been suspended since 2021, and replaced it with a new, tailor-made one. This new constitution gave him even more power, bringing what remained of the country's institutions to heel. He was accountable to no one. The decision sparked outrage and protests, as it ran counter to the secular principles on which the country had been founded. Three months after the proclamation of the new constitution, Islamist opponents were arrested. Six months later, it was the turn of the centrists. Four months later, it was the turn of the nationalists. Prisons became killing centers, and political prisoners were deprived of medical treatment and declared dead one after the other. Two months later, sub-Saharan migrants were rounded up on a massive scale. Women and children were brutalized, abducted and abandoned on the border with the Republic of Cyrenaica, in the Tatawana desert, without food or water.

**A phantom election**

The situation came to a head when Sidi rigged the 2024 elections. Officially re-elected with 99% of the vote, he had no political rivals until the last month of the presidential campaign. Some tried to run, but all ended up in prison. The last opponent arrested, former education minister Hajji Haloul, was arrested three days after announcing his intention to run. But as international opinion had to be satisfied, the president of the new puppet parliament, Bassam Aboubala, announced his candidacy at the last minute, even though a week earlier he had announced on the radio his unwavering support for the regime and his refusal of any alternative to President Sidi ""chosen by the people and by God to save humanity"".

This situation could no longer be allowed to continue, as the country was embroiled in a major economic crisis that had worsened as one freedom after another disappeared. Prices soared, unemployment soared and people struggled to make ends meet. Foodstuffs were no longer available, and power and water cuts became a weekly occurrence.

President Sidi had been accusing ""speculators"" and ""Zionists"" of being behind the shortages for months, but the reality was much darker. The regime had voluntarily reduced imports of agricultural products and suspended investment in the production of drinking water and electricity in order to pay the salaries of the army and the police, as well as certain personal expenses that he felt were important for the country's future. He increased his own salary and used the state coffers to shower the family of his beloved wife with gifts, since they were already staying at the presidential palace free of charge and enjoying all the benefits of power. A veritable family mafia thus had unlimited access to the public treasury, while the average citizen was left without milk for his baby.

**The spark**

The final straw came not from the opposition, but from the drug crisis. On July 21, 2025, the death in Kasfa of a mother of 5 from cancer that could not be treated due to the drug crisis caused a national scandal. An old video of the deceased woman, in which she expressed her indignation at the unavailability of cancer treatment, resurfaced and went viral on the internet.

Demonstrations began the same day in Kafsouan, the hometown of the deceased, before spreading to the rest of the country. The first demonstration did not worry the authorities. But little by little, indignation turned to revolt and the rallies intensified, mainly because the demonstrators shared the deceased's suffering: shortages, lack of prospects, the authorities' contempt for the population.

On July 22, President Sidi travelled to Kafsouan to offer his condolences to the family, but his speech accusing speculators of being behind the shortage of medicines failed to convince anyone. On the Twixxer social network, calls for the government to resign are multiplying. The Front de la Sauvegarde Nationale announced its support for the spontaneous demonstrations. The main leaders of both movements were arrested the following day.

When, two days later, the outskirts of the capital were hit by a first demonstration, the police tried to disperse it with tear gas, but the situation degenerated. Several officers and demonstrators were injured, and a number of people were arrested. In a crowd movement, a ten-year-old child was injured by a police charge and died of head trauma.

**The blaze**

On July 25, President Sidi dismissed the Minister of Health and made a public statement on national television to calm tempers. He declared that the situation was under control and that the protests were being led by foreign agents hiding among the demonstrators.

The following day, the revolt resumed with greater violence and spread to several towns on the outskirts of the capital. The demonstrators set fire to a police station, killing a policeman in the flames. Police then used live ammunition to disperse the demonstrators around the burning building, injuring several people, including one who was hospitalized and died of his wounds the following day. The police claimed that they had fired in self-defence against armed demonstrators.

On July 27, President Sidi took the stage and announced ""a merciless war"" and ""a national jihad"" against ""traitors"", ""agents of foreigners"" and ""apostates who have denied their religion and their homeland"" by joining the demonstrators. He quoted a prophetic hadith and announced that ""fitna is worse than murder"" and that order would be restored ""no matter what the cost"". He announced that the country would be ""cleansed of traitors and corruptors, district by district, house by house"", and concluded by promising ""a river of blood"" to the ""enemies of the Nation, Justice and Religion"". That same evening, the regime declared a nationwide curfew.

The speech shocked international opinion. France and the United States declare that they are deeply concerned by the situation in the country. The next day, the country's main trade union announced its support for the demonstrations. The police immediately arrested three union leaders.

In response, the trade union federation stepped up its calls for demonstrations. The revolt reached the capital's city center on July 29, with some 1,200 demonstrators now calling for the resignation of the President of the Republic.

In the evening, almost 100 lawyers close to the Front de Sauvegarde Nationale (National Safeguard Front) demonstrate in front of the Palace of Justice to demand the release of political opponents. The meeting was dispersed by the police, nearly 50 people were arrested and nearly 30 injured.

The following day, the Parti Constitutionnaliste Libre organized a demonstration in front of the women's prison to demand the release of party president Amel Moussa, who had been incarcerated on trumped-up charges.

**Information is a right**

In the evening, President Sidi attacked foreign TV channels, calling them ""devil's channels in the service of the Zionist entity and imperialism"". They accused them of broadcasting false allegations and of wanting to provoke ""chaos and disorder"". Foreign channels became inaccessible, and access to the social networking sites Twixxer and Homebook was cut off that very evening. The Internet was also cut off for several hours during the night. In response, Elon Tusk offered to provide the population with the Starlink internet access service.

The following day, President Sidi dismissed three different ministers, but left the Minister of the Interior untouched. He also dismissed several governors and announced the appointment of temporary military governors, appointed on the proposal of the Minister of Defense, until ""victory is total"".

The New York Times announced on the same day that the fall of President Sidi's regime was inevitable. In particular, the newspaper compares the current events to those of the fall of the Supreme Guide of the Arab Republic of Cyrenaica, Mohsen Ghadafa, in 2012.

For Al Jazeera, this ""revolution"" is the logical consequence of the economic situation and the political choices of the president, described as ""a mad dictator close to the Egyptian military regime"". A Turkish newspaper ran a caricature of President Sidi, portraying him as Hitler. A US-based opponent compares him in an interview to an ""autistic Lex Luthor"", intoxicated by power and ready to do anything to keep his throne.

On August 2, lawyers, cabs and teachers called a general strike. On August 3, an architect commits suicide in Sawsa. Clashes between demonstrators and the police became increasingly deadly. On the same day, 20 civilians were shot dead in Jendoux and two policemen were seriously wounded. Police and demonstrators blame each other for the violence.

A new report by a trade union official puts the death toll at at least 70, and staff at a hospital in the capital are officially protesting against ""the high number of casualties"" and ""the lack of medical equipment"". Infections from wounds are common, and the number of deaths of demonstrators in hospital continues to rise.

In the capital, students demonstrate outside the capital's main university and police lay siege to the university. The brutal police assault was filmed by hundreds of students entrenched in the administration buildings. Several dozen people were seriously injured.

**The people want the regime to fall**

The next day, stores were set on fire as demonstrators chanted ""The people don't want any more shortages! The people want the regime to fall!

President Sidi took to the stage that evening to denounce the demonstrators, whom he likened to a ""horde of foreigners"", ""migrants"", ""drug addicts"", ""traffickers"", ""criminals"", ""Zionists"" and ""traitors"", and whom he accused of ""destroying property"", ""raping women"" and ""burning innocent people alive"". Sidi calls on the rest of the population not to ""listen to the deceitful voice of the devil"", and to follow the example of the ""pious companions of the Prophet"", who have always shown ""wisdom"" and ""loyalty to the Truth"".

A few minutes after the President's speech, riots broke out in the suburbs of the capital and in the south of the country. For the first time, rioters attempted to set fire to a military building, but turned back after being fired upon. Similar scenes against the army were recorded in several regions of the country. In the south of the country, a terrorist slit the throat of an officer. In the north, demonstrators lynched a soldier outside a military barracks. In the capital, a demonstration brought together some 50,000 citizens. Slogans now systematically call for the fall of the regime, with cries of ""Get out Sidi"" and ""The people want Sidi out"". Prime Minister Maher Hassani announced the dismissal of Interior Minister Khaled Fathi and the release of all political opponents in a bid to quell the revolt. However, the ransacking of businesses became systematic during the demonstrations. Some young people in the capital suspected the military of being behind the looting and began to organize themselves into militias.

With the violence continuing, President Sidi announced on August 6 that he would not be standing for re-election and that his ""new constitution is sufficient to bring peace and prosperity to our country"". Sidi also ordered the police to stop shooting at demonstrators, and announced the repeal of the decree limiting freedom of expression and the forthcoming restoration of Internet sites. The same day, the army was deployed in the capital. Despite this, new clashes broke out in the heart of the capital, and were quelled by the police using tear gas. At the end of the afternoon, former president Momen Mazkouli, who had taken refuge in Paris, announced that the fall of the regime was a matter of days. That evening, Amel Moussa was released and immediately hospitalized, unable to walk for more than a few minutes.

The following day, President Sidi announced that he would ""not leave power"" before the end of his term, as he had ""the legitimacy granted to him by the People, by History and by God"". In the afternoon, a young demonstrator was shot dead in the heart of the capital, while unrest broke out in a seaside resort where a luxury residence belonging to President Sidi's sister-in-law was set on fire. The next day, the first fire broke out in a northern district of the capital. Half an hour later, a second fire broke out a little further south. Throughout the morning, at regular intervals, a new fire broke out, each time a little further south. The capital sank into a climate of unbearable violence, as demonstrations and looting increased. In the evening, President Sidi announces early legislative elections within six months, and seriously considers dismissing the government. He also cancelled his official trip to Egypt, scheduled for the following day. On the same day

All over the country, the wildest rumors are circulating. The most common of these is that security forces are attacking neighborhoods, particularly residential ones, in order to discredit the demonstrations. Other rumors claim that Egyptian undercover agents are regularly planting firebombs to justify the regime's violent repression. On the other hand, the president's supporters claim that Turkey and Qatar are involved in the violence in order to bring about regime change. In the neighborhoods, residents are getting organized. Barricades were set up at the entrances to the main streets. Night patrols were carried out. On August 9, thousands of students went to occupy parliament, but the army blocked their way.

**The fall of Pharaoh**

On the evening of August 10, a general advised President Sidi to resign. President Sidi refused. At 4.00 pm on August 11, as the population took to the streets in massive demonstrations, the army decided to intervene. In a swift, coordinated operation, military troops stormed the presidential palace. Three tanks were mobilized, but no shots were fired. The gates were opened without being forced. At 10.00 pm, Prime Minister Maher Hassani announced the death of the President on television. In circumstances that remain unclear, President Sidi was killed in an ""exchange of fire between the army and his last supporters in the presidential guard"", in which ""he refused to surrender"". Prime Minister Hassani then announced that he would assume the interim presidency until early presidential elections. He also announced a temporary return to the 2014 constitution and the arrest of the last Minister of Justice, Hala Jaafar, and the last two Ministers of the Interior, Tarek Sharafudin and Khaled Fathi, for high treason, undermining state security, abuse of power, murder and other offences. The country's diplomatic services are also in contact with the International Criminal Court to transfer Khaled Fathi to the Hague Tribunal for crimes against humanity.

The president's sister-in-law is arrested by the army in the morning, but the president's wife and children are nowhere to be found. They fled overnight by car to Algeria, then flew to Cairo, where they sought asylum. They will never see the country again.

**Aftermath**

Despite being the leader of a transitional government, interim president Hassani seems determined to remain president. At first, he was unsure whether he would seek a full presidential term when he announced parliamentary elections within six months. Hassani began to lose the support of the army due to his lack of dynamism and his total absence of charisma and poise. Nevertheless, his malleability has kept him in office. The demonstrators reduced their intensity in terms of violence, but persisted from time to time for several weeks. President Hassani is forced to abandon the idea of standing for election following the revelation of a financial scandal in which he is accused of having used his former position of responsibility within the Central Bank to finance his election campaign team.

When the new parliament was elected, the Islamist party was defeated by Amal Moussa's Parti Constitutionnaliste de Libre and a centrist party created by Arbi Chechaoui, the Parti Démocrate Libre. Amel Moussa and Arbi Chechaoui were elected deputies and announced their intention to run in the next presidential elections. During a parliamentary session, Hassani gave a speech. The deputies then began voting on whether to accept or reject his speech. Habibie tried to win the support of the military by offering the vice-presidency to an army general, but his offer was declined. His speech was rejected by a majority and Hassani tendered his resignation. Vice-president Bassam Aboubala then succeeded him as interim president until parliament appointed a new transitional president.

As the dust settled and the country began to recover from the events, the truth about former president Sidi's reign came to light. It was revealed that he had siphoned off government funds, lining his own pockets while the people suffered. His academic and legal training was just a façade, a means of gaining the people's trust as he prepared his ascent to absolute power with the help of Egyptian and Algerian intelligence.

The new transitional government worked tirelessly to restore order and democratic processes, and a sense of hope was once again instilled in the hearts of the population. Former President Sidi's accomplices, including his former ministers, were brought to justice, and the country began the long road to recovery.

But the wounds of his dictatorship will never heal completely, and the people will never forget the lesson they've learned: always question those in power, and never let their guard down in the face of manipulation and deception.

I am vegetarian (in the sense that I have a rare condition and physically cannot consume meat or seafood).

Avoid the word « vegetarian » (végétarien, نباتي) when you explaining what you can and cannot have. Instead, say that you cannot eat any fish, tuna, chicken, lamb, beef, etc. Maybe mention that you get sick if you eat these items.

Also ask questions, even if an item looks vegetarian on the menu, it may have tuna or something on it even if it isn’t listed on the menu. 

You could probably have pizza, kafteji, malfouf omlette, pastas, vegetable couscous, etc. maybe brik nature (without tuna), and maybe lablebi.

I'm a first-year university student currently enrolled in a ""Licence"" program in ""informatique de gestion"" at ""Institut Supérieur d'Administration des Affaires de Sfax."" Having earned a baccalaureate degree in informatics, I'm finding myself at a critical crossroads.

Upon delving into the coursework of my current program, I've come to realize that much of what is being taught feels outdated and, in my assessment, somewhat irrelevant to real-world applications. This realization has led me to question the value of continuing with this bachelor's degree, as I am confident that I can acquire more relevant knowledge and skills by dedicating focused self-learning efforts in a specific domain.

In contemplating my options, I've also considered returning to live with my family, which would provide me with the flexibility to engage in activities like gym training and potentially launch an online business in professional design.  


if you were my place,  will you choose to continue with this degree or opt for alternative paths? What exactly should I do? ","What you’re experiencing is true for most of university education paths. I would recommend u get ur degree. Just hang on.. However, you should also be self-learning while working on ur degree, u’ll find the time if u quit social media and other time wasters. I know it’s easier said than done but that’s the advice i got from Mr. Taki (rich Tunisian) when i was wondering the same on my first year in college and i’m passing it to you","You can learn a lot from doing an outdated program with a keen awareness of its outdatedness, using it as a stepping stone for yourself. Just stay on your toes with the critical thinking.

\+ its great to have something like a degree to fall back on in case your alternative paths fall through and/or you need economic stability for a period before delving into those paths.","finish the degree 

get masters in a field you like that your degree allows you to do too 

do the self learning 

and honestly given the market and the amount of graduates in IT 

just do your part and hope for the best 

that's all i can tell you 

but above all do not drop out and fall for that bootcamp scams and ""you can get a job without a degree"" bulshit because you simply won't .",,,2024-01-14 20:25:58

I've heard that Route 2 might be a good idea due to the weather.. but will things in the South disrupted during Ramadan? Or will it be mostly business as usual with just some eating difficulties?

Also, would it be better to stay overnight in Tunis, La Marsa, or Sidi bou Said given that it's Ramadan?

Aim for residential areas where most of the people are at work and there aren't that many retirees/housewives to fight with (e.g: Ghazela/Manar/Ennasr). 

If you have a car go to Géant/Carrefour Marsa, again at 10 am. (Worked for me on multiple weekends)

At lunch break during work if you have a Carrefour nearby check it out too. You don't have to go in just give the counters a quick glance and you'll see whether or not people are carrying Milk/Butter/Flour.

Usually if there's a commotion it's 100% guaranteed there's milk.

All serious candidates (other than maybe Safi Said if you consider that serious) either are in prison, have active cases against them, or were released on bail and basically had to shut up or go back.

Most importantly, even if there was a serious candidate, they will not be allowed to campaign just like how Fadhel Abdelkafi wasn’t allowed to campaign for No: constantly harassed and even threatened to be arrested, attacked, not allowed to use any media/funding…etc at the same time that Kais Saied allowed himself to break all the rules by doing advertisements everywhere including the day of elections, used the Tunisian flag in campaigns even though it wasn’t allowed, broke the electoral silence in the morning of election day and on national television, used the state’s resources from wataneya to dour chabeb to campaign.

She was engaged out of love. All was going well till the guy turned to a narcissist crazy monster.

She used to go visit his mother and sister in their home but never went there when he was alone.

One day, he told her that his mom wants to see her and she was happy to go. But then, he was the only one in the house. Dragged her, broke her phone, and did what he did! Bruises kicking and rapes. All these because she wanted to delay the marriage until she finishes her Masters. She was 26.

He then threatens her that he will destroy her life and reputation if she tells anyone. 

The families are preparing for wedding but she hates him now. Speechless and helpless. Scared and clueless. Then the guy becomes creepier and worse. Follows her to university, checks her phones and everything and asks her to come to his house! None was a pleasure for her. She was threatened and scared as mentioned. And we all know it is always the girl's fault !!

She couldnt even tell her parents or closest friends. This kept going for months.

One day a relative of the guy told her she knows he is cheating on her with someone else. She used this and told his mother and sister to stay away from him but that didn't work and he turned worst.

Until one day he hit her (He used to hit and punch and pull her hair in aggression) in public. She starts screaming and people gather. There are witnesses. She goes to the police and he goes behind the bars. But of course, he has connections so he is out with the condition of staying away from her.

He tried hard to take her back and apologized etc but too late too much damage already done.

I heard the story and I am speechless. I never imagined ... but I wonder if there is anything to do for justice? I have little hopes. I know almost impossible but thoughts?

I really hope for support here. Not looking for negative replies. I feel so sorry for her but I wish could do more than just sorry.","I think it's too late to sue for rape.

Already got the restraining order i guess.

So all she should now is seeking a psychiatrist, cuz there is some PTSD in there.

Best of luck to her!","At least, she got away alive. I am not sure she can do anything about the rape, it has been a long time since then, but if she insists on doing something, she has to check with a lawyer what can be done, she is an adult, and if she is financially independent, she can handle it without her parents knowing (if they still don't know)

If the harassment continues (I am assuming the marriage is cancelled and everything is over), she has to document everything and go to the police, with a lawyer of course. If he has connections with the police, it is better to go directly to the prosecutor (وكيل الجمهورية), which is always a better thing to do than going to the police.",,,,2024-01-15 04:19:24

It is not uncommon that a football federation is corrupt in Africa, come on it is Africa, and it is football. Let's put aside the infamous publicly-claimed corruption of the federation, and discuss why such people are managerial roles of l'EN. In all other nations, although corrupt, the national team is always sacred and shall be treated that way. The national team is not a local team. The most corrupt federations know this and deal with it because any national team in any sports is a representation of the country. Regardless of how corrupt a federation might be, when it comes to their ENs, competent people are always in place: coaches, talents and logistics responsibles. Except in Tunisia where the personal interests reach national teams and represent us as clowns in every competition. A coach with no achievements, unexperienced responsibles are holding the responsibility of representing the nation and disappointing every Tunisian in every possible way.

The stock market is a joke and in view of our current economical and political situations, it will not get any better.

You can place your money as a fixed deposit ""dépôts à terme"" and negotiate the rate with the bank. The bigger the amount, the longer the period, the better the interest rate you'll get. It will be always higher than the saving interest rate.

If you're staying in Grand Tunis, regular milk is not available (might run into a box or two by chance in a Supermarket like géant).

1997xjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1997xjj/30m_asexual_struggle/,6,30m asexual struggle,"I have been pruning my contact list recently for the same reason: feeling offended and disrespected when people doubt my sexual orientation, even my family doesn't understand.

I have removed almost all my childhood friends, which was painful, as they never saw me in a relationship publicly, so they tend to be more sure about their doubts, and it always ends up with someone offending me. I was soft on them, giving them hints and discussing the subject without implying it to myself, but it didn't work.

Girls get into dating, but once they know it won't end up with them in sexual relationship, they just leave. I really respect that, but meeting them again with that look on their faces is not comfortable by any means; made a miStAkE by dating from same university.

I was lucky once to date an older lady who was smart, charming, and beautiful, and I thought we were a match, but she was not good at hiding her lies. At this point, it couldn't be serious, and I was so desperate to stay and see the whole relationship fall apart.

Family pressuring marriage is really hitting hard, and I don't want to pick up the phone anymore.

Who knew my sexual orientation would be such a handful, and the funny part is that they all left the country. I feel this is unfair and not knowing how much time I could keep up is very stressful.

I appreciate your thought on how could you dodge that bullet if you where me.","Are you both asexual and aromantic? Maybe try finding partners who are also ace or gray/demisexual; they'll likely get where you're coming from! And if you're into someone, just be upfront about it to manage expectations from the start.
Also you can try posting in this sub r/asexuality","You're like a Monk or a saint, something people usually look up to and like, idk how you get picked on by them.
For family pressure, they should respect your decision in not wanting to get married even if you were normal.
Cutting friends because of that seems a bit extreme to me.
For girls, i thought that's what they always wanted, boys that don't look for sex, especially in our society where a lot of them still find it taboo.
Overall, i think developing a thick skin might do wonders for you.","Sorry man, being different than sis straight will always be seen as weird, abnormal in our society. I hope you realize that you're perfectly normal and healthy. Asexual people exist and they should receive the same respect as everyone else. However, it is hard to change things around, my only advice would be to go live abroad in a western country, where you can easily blend in, and keep the family pressure and trouble far away",Bro I feel u and I'm close to my 30 and in the same stage but is not about you ! Is just the girls you are going with just not your type!

I'm curious if any of you have experience immigrating to the UK – is it an easy or complex process? With a background of 3 years in technical support and IT infrastructure consulting, do you think it would be easy for me to find a job opportunity in the UK?

I understand some might disagree, viewing immigration as not a solution...
To keep it brief, what, in your opinion, is an easily accessible immigration destination that isn't Islamophobic, isn't too far away, and doesn't have extreme weather conditions (like Canada)? I want to hear everyone's opinion and experiences ☺️ thankyou!",If islamophobia is an issue for you I advice you to stay away from Europe.,"Hey OP, I'm not Tunisian - I'm Moroccan and I live in the UK. It's very difficult to immigrate to Britain in general, the process is complicated and expensive. The rules change every time and with every upcoming election, the UK government and media love to portray us immigrants as the cause of all problems, so that means tightening the rules. And as someone pointed out in the comments, the process to get ILR (indefinite leave to remain) is tricky. 

First, check if your job is on the shortage occupation list. If it is, then check the registered list of sponsors, start looking for vacancies in your field from that list, and contact them by email.

E.g. that Adam and Eve were indeed the sole ancestor of humans alive today, but God sent them as children of an already existing human species, and the lineages of fellow members of the species ended up extinct.

Most I talked with either accept evolution for all other species except humans who the maintain unrelated to the others, or reject the whole theory and believe all species directly formed in (almost) their current forms through some sort of divine intervention.

I personally don't believe in anything supernatural stuff, but I do get the appeal of it since the remaining two or three mysteries are indeed puzzling. I just wish my entourage would stop stubbornly denying the already solved mysteries, I feel they don't even realize the intense and honest efforts of scientists to mechanistically solve this fascinating mystery and the mountains of evidence they managed to discover, especially since Quran's vague enough to reinterpret to aligning with modern knowledge. We even came up with possible ways the first forms of life could've emerged, though it's tricky to know exactly which reactions occurred since they leave almost no traces/fossils. It doesn't concern me much, but this stubborn rejection of established science even makes the religion look bad and uninviting.

What are your thoughts?","God said he created mankind, he did not specify how, so evolution can be one of the ways 🤷‍♀️","You are bringing the Creationist vs Evolutionist debate.

A synthesis between the two positions is possible however, will it be the truth ?

Adam and Eve could have been the first in our species that came after a cataclysmic event but not the first Human like creatures ever existed.

1- لفهم العقلية ما بعد الهجرة، لازم تفهم أسباب الهجرة أولا ..

التونسي، يهاجر لأسباب اقتصادية بحته. 
في ذهنه، أحسن عيشة هي عيشة ""التوب رجلة"" و التجوبير تاع النمط المجتمعي التونسي .. لذلك، ما يلقاش روحه في اي مجتمع متحرر .. ما ينجمش يندمج .. و حتى لو يندمج، اول ما يرجع لتونس، يرجع بمنطق ""عادت حليمة لعادتها القديمة"" و هذا تنجم تلاحظة على اي انسان يروح بعد مع كمل عقد العمل تاعه ..
( فقط قلة قليلة عقليتها تتبدل، و هاذم غالبا، منذ البداية تلقاهم حابين يغيروا العقلية و يغيروا نمط العيش )

في مقابل ذلك، عرب المشرق، يهاجرون عموما لأنه معادش عندهم مكان في بدانهم ( حروب اهلية كيما سوريا و لبنان، هروب من الدولة و اجهزتها كيما السعودية و الاردن، حروب مع دول اخرى كيما العراق .. الخ. )
لذلك، الناس هذيكا، غير قادرة و غير راغبة، للعودة لبلدانها .. ما عندو حتى حل الا انه يحاول يندمج في المجتمع الجديد ..
و على الرغم من ذلك، مش قادرين يندمجوا بالرغم من رغبتهم في الاندماج.


2- التونسي، يحب يسكر و يزطل و يرقد مع بنات .. اما ما ياكلش لحم الخنزير خاطر حرام ..
برا احكي معاه تراه .. 

المقصود هنا، اللي التونسي، بسيب برشا أسباب يطول شرحها ( ثقافية، اجتماعية، دينية، عرفية .. الخ ) ولات مشكلته، انه متناقض، و عايش بزوز وجوه .. و ينافق في الناس و ينافق حتى في روحه ..

Many people like to suggest and refer to them as a ”Conspiration theory”. But the things i’ve come across and seen and encountered gave me certainty that they indeed exist and rules the world by a systematic system.

For anyone who read this far and doesn’t know what i’m talking about i’ll give you a quick insight: The Elite have existed for many hundred years but they first emerged with their influential power after they won the fight against the ottoman empire, and it fell.

The elite controll all the leaders in the muslim world, and they are leaders who have been choosen as presidents by themselves like Salman (saudiarabia , Erdogan (Turkey), Sisi (egypt) and more. The controll emerged when Ottoman empire lost the battle against the elites several hundreds years ago. Since then the elite have removed all leaders who did not obey their agenda. 

The elite are from the worlds richest families like the rockefeller, the rothschilds and many many more. They own all the central banks in the world amongst them J.P. Morgan. They controll the media, the influential people and by controlling these they restrict the people from many things. 
They spread evil and disaster through brainwashing the humanity. They have several instruments like alcohol & drugs, music and media.

Just look at the covid for instance that emerged from nowhere, didn’t the government look you all up as you were small rats? They did the same in most of the countries in the world. It was either lock up or restrictions for everyone) Just imagine what they could do to you by making a simple scene of something alike.

This is just a small summary of it all there is so much more. The group have an inner and outer circle together with people admiring and worshipping them. I myself have met a guy belonging to them (a pastor/priest in a church) because of the symbols I saw on the top of the church (jesus making the sign of baphomet) I decided to ask him and he told me yes we obey the elite and implement their orders. Now I am limited to my writing and can’t write everything I want here.

But let me tell you something and remember this.

The world isn’t what you think a kind and good world with goodness everywhere. The government doesn’t want what’s best for us and the ones ruling them are even worse… the humanity will face a harder time soon.",You've been playing too much Assassin's Creed,"> they first emerged with their influential power after they won the fight against the ottoman empire, and it fell.

Elites are those defined by having power and money (from which power can be derived anyway), so obviously they will have influence over their respective countries and over the world.

But Illuminati ? Free Masons ? Cabals ?

The Illuminati were nothing more than a 18th century club of intellectuals in Bavaria who got persecuted by the Duke at the time as he didn't want his subjects to have any of those ""terrible"" ideas like overthrowing the king, decreasing church power and abolishing serfdom. He then received a letter saying that this group ""started the French revolution"" (instead of ... you know ... people being angry about their terrible absolute monarch ?) and ever since then anything that opposed monarch and church power has been attributed to them by crazy conspiracy theorists in Europe (and then Muslims picked it up and gave it their own spin).

Free Masons ? Originally a medieval guild of masons (duh) that evolved into a club. Today, it is no different than those university fraternities except for old dudes. Back in the day tons of people joined them (especially from Protestant backgrounds) due to their sense of community including many influential people, but today that's no longer the case.

>jesus making the sign of baphomet

Baphomet is an idol invented by the French king and the Catholic church to disband the Knights Templars (to destroy their power and acquire their wealth). His name was derived from the Old French name for Mohammed (Mahomet). Basically people in the Middle Ages thought Muslims worshipped Mahomet and accused the Knights Templars of picking up the idol during the Crusades. The story is obviously ridiculous and there is no proof such an idol was ever worshipped at a significant scale before Satanists in modern times picked up the iconography to troll religious people (and it looks like they are doing a great job).

>The world isn’t what you think a kind and good world with goodness everywhere

The world can be not king and good while at the same time not being run by all of these ""secret societies"". The two ideas aren't mutually exclusive.

Your best option is to set up a Payoneer account, 99% of companies have Payoneer as their partner and they use it frequently to pay freelancers online. Once you set up your payoneer account you need to verify it using your driver's license or passport. And you're all set to receive your salary.

Once you have your salary in your account, you're free to either use your digital credit card or ask for your card to be delivered to your doorstep. You can use your card to withdraw from an ATM ( fees are 2 dollars per withdraw operation). Or you can simply sell US dollars for 4DT the unity to gambling dudes.

&#x200B;

Trust me, this is your best option, and since your receive more than 2K, you will be relieved from Payoneer's fees (60$ Per year). Do not let any Tunisian bank interfere with money you receive online.",,,2024-01-19 18:31:44

We wanted to try out where the local people eat so went to one of the ones with the meat hanging outside, let's call it a Grill. 

We asked for 1x Lamb Grill, this was to be 4 pieces of meat, we didn't want to eat too much.

We got: 

1.5L water - to share 
2x 4 pieces of Lamb, with a side of fries 
1 small can of coca cola.

We sent back the following as we only wanted the Lamb. 

2 x Plate of what I can describe as mixed grilled veg - which we sent back.
1 x bread basket - which we went back
2 x plate of spaghetti - which we sent back

We were charged 192 TND, from what we had seen in the city, alarm bells were going off that this was too much, so we queried it. 

There wasn't an itemised receipt, the man literally wrote '192,000'  on a piece of paper and gave it to us. When we asked to see the prices on the kiosk, we were told the machine wasn't working.

We only had 80 dinar on us, so I said we'll pay that and then go to the cash machine to get the rest. 

The man escorted us to the cash machine...I didnt trust the situation so made us  B line to the police check point, said I was going to bank de tunis, our escort suddenly left when I started speaking to the police. 

When I asked the police they said that the price of 192 was too high for the food we ate... we said we paid 80 dinar he said it was OK, but said we shouldn't eat outside of the check points.

So my question is, as a local, what is the price for a Grill?

We are quite happy to pay the local costs but this situation didn't feel right...","I can't give an estimate without knowing portions, how fancy the place is, etc. But I'd say around 30ish a portion. Nowhere near 192.

You're entitled to an itemized receipt (with tax listed) btw, AND a menu with listed prices, you can simply refuse to pay otherwise.","Sounds like u got ripped.

Also, I'm not a good writer and this is will be long but I will to do a tldr part in the end of this post.

Anyways, I posted 2 months ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/188y86g/how_legal_is_self_defense/) asking about legality of self defense and at the same time sharing my experience with Brakaj, So turns out not only the two pricks live in my neighborhood (Bir hlow, West Kram) but also one of them lives in the same alleyway I live in so eventually I managed to know their home addresses, their names and even got their Facebook profiles.

Long story short, I thought about going immediately to the police but I remember that my area is very dangerous and I thought maybe the muggers would attempt to get revenge one day so I decided to try another way to get something out of them, I talked to them separately, One told me that he will buy me another phone but it was obviously bullshit or even if he did, He will most likely get me a stolen phone, The other guy told me that he has no problem in killing me and that I have nothing on him, He said police won't find the phone and there's nothing that can prove he did what he did. I honestly thought maybe he's kinda right, I don't have a footage or something else to prove anything, I'm just missing my phone.

I tried to do a stupid thing which is making a fake profile and contacting them through Facebook, One guy tried to claim innocence but then started threatening me, The other guy didn't respond and probably won't.

So I tried to talk to their families and I went to one of their houses and as soon as I knocked on the door and peeked inside to talk to anyone a guy came up, dragged forcibly outside and slapped me hard in the face and warned me about coming back again (And he said a lot of curse words obviously), Luckily some guys witnessed this and tried to help, They told me that they'll to the muggers to not approach me again, I have friends in the neighborhood who also said the same thing, That they will be told to leave me alone and never come to me. I kinda felt like that's enough, My phone is gone and I probably will never get it back but that's okay, I just kept thinking about the whole situation, Especially the knife that was pulled in front of me, The threats I heard and the slap in the face. I guess I have to forget about all this.

All of this is not a first in my life, In fact it happened to me numerous times but I don't know why it felt different this time, I talked to people I never wanted to talk to, I felt without dignity thanking people too much for the smallest bit of help and not showing any kind of anger or something like that when I talked to the muggers, I barely hid my fear and barely could control my paranoia.

All in all, I can't move to a better place, My family barely managed to own a house here (The prices here are super cheap for an obvious reason) and honestly, Is there a better place in Tunisia at all ? These kind of people roam all over the country, So I got no option but to fit in and get used to living here and so that's something I also don't know about.

If anyone of you has experience with these kind of neighborhoods or even live in one of them, How do you deal with situations like this or how do you even avoid them ? Also, Can I hope that my neighborhood will get better one day ? or Do areas like these have no future and are a lost cause ?

**TLDR : My problem with the mugging still continued since I discovered that the muggers live in my area and I got a lot of information about them (like names, addresses, social media accounts), But I don't know what to do and I messed up a lot and almost got myself into big trouble (I got slapped in the face which is really a minor thing in comparison to what could've happened) so I decided to not provide any information to the police and just forget about it to avoid more trouble and end the problem but I'm still not sure if I did the right decision or not, Again I felt like a coward and lost my dignity and respect. This situation made me think about my living conditions and if I can hope that one day my living condition will improve or if I'm gonna keep being subjected to troubles like these.**","You're really naive for going to confront them or even talking to them. What's wrong with you? Go to police, open a case, and get a lawyer to follow up. Even if nothing happens today or tomorrow, chances they will be caught in 2, 3 or 5 years. At least you have something on them.

Nobody will kill you for a phone. I know murders happen but its not that easy. Be careful, don't go out late (or too early) and spend your day either in your house or outside your area. Go to your friends place, spend time with them in their area if it's safer, or just go to university in another governorate and enjoy safety there. Mahdia, Nabel and other areas are way safer than Tunis. 

Again, I don't even know what happened in your mind to confront them. Why would you do that? I know people here don't trust police but open a case and get a case number. That's a good start.","I got mugged once (bracelet it didnt mean shit to me but the whole scenario of being mugged kept me angry for a while) so i totally understand what you're feeling, you basically looking for revenge which is any dude's reaction after being hurt in any form. Honestly it was stupid of you to talk to them directly because you exposed the anger in you and it was a direct threat and u basically told them i got my eyes on you, which they will answer bel haja lwahida lyaarfouha violence. My advice to you, let it sink the phone you lost mehouch aham men hyetk w matkhalich mo5ek y9olek you're james bond. There's always the possibility of the unexpected happening and it could be worse than you think. Keep your ass safe, the second possibility is. Keep your head low for a couple of months and counter attack by reaching to the cops since you already have all infos.","U need better strategic thinking, defensive techniques and ruthless heart with 0 fear, death lover kind of mentality. Work on that and u'll get better.",Don’t get down on your self. Shit happens and you gotta roll with it. Those are thugs and their day will come. When you are a big shot with a great job and your swanky house somewhere cool and hip they’ll still be mugging and thugging and they’ll get slapped right and left if not by life then probably by other thugs and/or the cops. Repeat after me: fuck those thugs!!!,"Man, when you tried to involve their families, that was risky stuff, and you got off easy with just a slap and not being stabbed. You messed it up, and you could have solved the issue from the beginning. I live in such neighborhoods, and here's what you should have done.  


So, since you said you got friends in the neighborhood, hitting them up would've been your first move. Describe those muggers, get your friends in the loop. If they're well-connected, they'd probably identify them. If not, ask them to snoop around for stolen phones, trying to retrieve yours. Then, it's about having your friends negotiate with to those muggers to return the phone, maybe throwing a bit of cash (like 100 TD) on the table. Timing is crucial here; you gotta act fast before your phone changes hands.  


In case the phone is sold **and you didn't negotiate with the muggers through your friends**, providing the phone's serial number to the police and maintaining communication with them would have been the next logical step. 


Now, about smoothing things over, I'd tell your friends to pass on a sincere sorry to those guys. Let them know you realized you messed up and blame it on being out of your mind, maybe taking a Lyrica pill. Or even better have your friends arrange meeting those muggers and say it yourself, and add to that, ""3a-b- lih telifoun el mouhem tasfa el9loub w 7kaya w t3adet"", etc. 


I understand it's difficult to say sorry in your situation, but since you didn't grow up there and you lack the local connections that defend and protect you (wled 7ouma ygaythouha 3ala 5atrek w yadherbou m3ak), you have no other choice. ",2024-01-20 19:10:22

19bahzp,https://i.redd.it/fznefrq77ldc1.jpeg,5,"Hdi of different Regions of Tunisia, how accurate is this ?",,"1. the numbers in the article you're referencing (I'm assuming this [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_regions\_of\_Tunisia\_by\_Human\_Development\_Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_of_Tunisia_by_Human_Development_Index)) don't actually fully match the source it cites. About half of the numbers on the list are simply wrong.
2. Re: 'Sud Est' and 'Sud Ouest' doing surprisingly well, you have to be aware of what factors into the calculation of the Human Development Index. HDI only covers three factors: Health (calculated using life expectancy), Education (calculated by years of schooling) and income (calculated as GNI per capita). 
   1. What pulls up the score of SE is Health: people live longer than the national average. But what does that reflect? First of all it's an average - for instance the health system is much better in Gabes than in Tataouine. Second, given the subpar hospital situation in a large portion of the region, it's probably much more likely that the longer life expectancy reflects lifestyle differences, like less exposure to big city-pollution, more community-based care, less indulgence in unhealthy food and less stress.
   2. What pulls up the score of SW is Education: people go to school for longer than the average. However, it is a known fact, especially in Tunisia where the unemployment level for those with university degrees is *higher* than for those without, that years of schooling doesn't necessarily translate into employment. For instance Gafsa of course is famous for its large amounts of unemployed university graduates who are active in associations related to their status.
   3. As for income, both of these two regions are below country average, but not by much. However, it is not clear what part of the regional economy is factored into the regional GNI (the region's yearly income divided by its number of inhabitants). I could imagine for instance that phosphates, oil and natural gas income might count into the regional GNI for SE and SW, even though this money only benefits select few in the regions, and the majority of it is funnelled onward to Tunis, Europe and Canada.
   4. Be aware that in these regions, socio-economic issues have a tendency to lead to migration, whether that be to the capital or out of the country. Thus, it's likely that there's a slight statistical tendency that those who remain in SE and SW tend to be less economically challenged than those who have left to go elsewhere and thus won't be represented in the statistics.

All in all, you ask, how accurate is the list? Well despite the fact that half the numbers are wrong, it's accurate, but only for what it measures. And there are many reasons why what it measures is not a complete picture of the development situation.","South East is unexpectedly high, maybe because of extremely cheap rent (relatively speaking), cheap prices, and if you count in Djerba.",,,,2024-01-20 12:15:31

-Kindness and empathy. The man I'm with must be able to put himself in the shoes of others and understand their struggles and not be judgmental.
-Hard-working and ambitious, tbh I'd rather have a man who's built himself from the ground up than a spoiled rich man who doesn't know the value of money and hard-work, that being said, I don't except him to be rich or middle class especially in this economy, I think everyone is struggling and men who are working hard should get some appreciation and credit no matter the results.
-Honest and loving, I can't imagine living a lie thinking my partner is crazy about me and he's out there flirting or talking shit behind my back.
-Proactive and can stand up for himself, as in if we talk and agree about something, he won't be running around asking his circle of friends or family their take and then suddently turning on me, I also want our relationship secrets and problems to stay between us and neither of us would involve others, unless it's a qualified therapist.
-Cultivated (degrees don't really matter in this one) 
-Not rigid/merciful and compationnate.
-Has a sense of humor.

The customs, the receipts, most of the paperwork, the hotel, the bank, the people in the service industry, the direction signs, some newspapers, and in government administrations  everything is in both French and Arabic.

Calling Tunisian an Arabic dialect is like calling French a Latin dialect.

Ama teklou mel 9ama7 eli ba3thetou l usa l tounes April 2023 ?","A common misconception about boycotting is you either have to boycott everything or nothing, otherwise, you would be labelled as a hypocrite or something along those lines. But the truth is, you only have to boycott what falls within your ability, and you try to expand your ability over time as much as possible. Of course many people may not even be aware of where certain products come from for them to even think about boycotting them. But the main point is that ultimately, economic damage that you can inflict on parties that you do not agree with, when it accumulates significantly, serves to make them reconsider their positions. The damage does not need to be total, nor even a majority, but only significant enough to reach that objective.","1/ it's about brands, not the country

Anyway, Boycotts in general are aimed against products that are not essential and that can be replaced by other products. So calling to boycott ""el 9am7"" which is very necessary in making bread is really a dumb idea since no one can boycott it.  Calling to boycott facebook or twitter (whose owners are pro zionists) is also very silly since those platforms can be very useful to spread the palestinian case.


That's why the boycott list should be limited and should not include all american products. BDS has already made a list of the brands that supports israel the most. We focus on them initially. Once the majority of people become aware and start boycotting them, we can add other brands to the list.","Palestine trend is already dead

I would not say you'll overcome it and things will get better for granted. 

If you're conscious enough to know that GYM and hobbies are only a distraction, than you have to figure a way out, coz these hobbies will make you feel worse.

Few advises i can give you from my lessons learned: 

- Get better every day, no matter how , by hitting the GYM , by learning new things, even learning how to make a strong and reliable CV, achieving some records for anything, even dopamine detoxing, that will give you some energy to resist. 

- Pray , if you're a muslim, pray, and grant discipline in it, you'll feel much stronger and issues will seem more resolvable. 

- Do not seek love, don't run after finding love, you're not your best version, and eventually you're not matching your perfect soulmate, actually.

- leaving the country is not the solution, it is an alternative, and remember if your need is success you have to start doing it no matter where you are.

Finally, do never forget : ""لا يكلف الله نفسا إلا وسعها ""","I don't have a particular advice, but life eventually gets better, keep that in mind. Keep the faith brother","I feel like clarity of mind is crucial to know where you're going. Don't guiltrip yourself because you might need to take a step back and relax to reasses yourself before taking the next step forward. Of course when life happens it happens you just gotta work with what you have until things clear up, and even that's another chance for growth.
Julienhimself on youtube has a lot of insight on how to pick yourself up, the book ""the power of now"" by eckhart tolle helped me and my sister a lot with existentialism and finding spiritual growth, David Goggins' story and accomplishments as a whole are extremely motivating for when you need that hunger to move forward, and honestly remembring those who genuinely unconditionally care about you is one of the biggest drives for me. But the teaching doesn't work unless you put in the work. Praying for you 🙏","I had a similar situation and what helped me is that I decided to use the time OFF as a chance to deal with  the existential questions and uncertainties I had. My attitude towards this was  ""I'm just gonna use whatever I have (ressources/skills) to get as close as possible to the truth"" 
And that Journey revolutionized my life and it changed my world view, how I perceive things and how I make decisions. 

Alhamdulillah Islam is way more than just what's being taught in our secularized society or the ""tarbia islameya"" in school

The moment you realize how ""Rizq"" works and who actually takes care of that, the casual fear/anxiety from the unknown reaches negligible levels or even ceases to exist.

A wise sentence at the end:
Pain is inevitable but suffering is a choice. 

Rabi yehdina.","I faced significant challenges during my ""prepa"" studies, leading to moments of despair and even suicidal thoughts. However, my determination, faith in Allah, and the reminder of His saying ""إنَّ مَعَ العُسْرِ يُسْراً"" kept me going. It's crucial to find a glimmer of hope during difficult times, whether it's family, a friend, a hobby, or anything that resonates with you.

Fast forward to today—I am happily married, living a fulfilling life and pursuing a high-quality job in Paris. I understand that life involves inevitable highs and lows, and I'm prepared to face uncertainties, knowing that resilience defines our journey.

Their rebuttal of Evolution and Darwinism using classic lies made up by Creationist groups financed by Mega-Church Billionaires, all in order to defend Islam is ridiculous.

The funny thing is that these same Creationist groups are rabid racists and islamophobics who would gladly support dropping a nuclear bomb on Mecca. Enemy of my enemy, I guess...

So here's a serie of debunk videos by an actual scientist of all the creationist ""research"" institution content that seem so popular among educated Muslims today.

It is extremely informative and will also teach you interesting aspects of evolution theory and why we know for certain that it is true.

No Muslim accepts evolution **except** some like Adnan Ibrahim and a few others who will do anything and who will always keep twisting Quranic verses in order to reconcile Islam with science (just like what those who believe that the Quran has ""scientific miracles"" are doing. lol).

But the absolute majority of Muslims deny evolution.

Why? Well, they just want to remain Muslims... Personally, evolution was one of the many main reasons that made me leave Islam. I've watched/read a lot of Islamic apologists' responses online on evolution, and I later found out that they are either ignorant or liars, unfortunately, \[ynaykou wa7edhom\] and literally lost trust in most of them.","I was on the previous thread and I said that evolution is the method of creation, and that the hardcore atheist evolutionists are understating how absolutely infinitesimal the probabilities related to the random mutations are. It's even worse when they think they disproved God by proving evolution. What bothers me in your poste is that you seem to think you're smarter for ""believing"" in evolution, by portraying those who don't believe in it as dumber. Can you say with 100% certainty that evolution is true?","(Note: In this comment I'm talking about most tunisians which are educated, obviously there are some exceptions especially in rural areas.)

Most of Tunisians are pretty educated. They do trust science; for example they abandoned traditional and supernatural means of treatments and resorted to actual doctors. They no longer believe in supernatural explanations about certain physical phenomenas and instead instead listen to scientifical explanations.
However there's one domain in which a lot of Tunisians don't resort to science to explain: the creation of the universe and life. Obviously because of religious reasons. That could be explained by the fact that tunisians trust their beliefs more than science. So the times they actually utilize/trust science is when it aligns with their beliefs, which is thankfully most of the time. However in the rare occasions when both their beliefs and science don't align, which is usually creationism and evolution, they would trust their beliefs over science.
Thankfully, at the moment this isn't that big of an issue since, as I explained earlier, the only time this issue shows up is in very specific topics such as creationism and evolution. So ultimately (99% of the time), tunisians do trust science.","Not this shit again.

I've been grinding certificates on Coursera this past month, ones that I find interesting and that I can learn from. I'm a software engineering student by the way. 

But lately I asked myself whether they're worth it or not in my field especially when several software engineers have them at this point. 

I asked this question here because I want you guys' input on this in the Tunisian market, currently I'm not interested in foreign job markets.

Thank you for your time!

Tldr: are coursera certificates worth for software engineers in Tunisia?","Skills >> Degrees.

What can you do after the certification >> How many certifications you have.

You are hired to add value and not to ""يزيّنوا بيك صحن"".

Look at the job offers requirements as your learning checklist.

You need to focus on a tech and master it. 

Avoid the shiny new thing.

Long answer: coursera / udemy doesn't ensure you have the skills necessary. coursera doesn't control the exam or assessment environment like pearson Vue systems. meaning why can't you just be a cheater for example in Udemy u can escape to the end of all the videos and obtain the certificate of completion  at least that's what recruiters know for sure. you want something serious there is a reputable providers like Oracle, amazon, microsoft ,comptia, ccna.. they all adapt the Pearson vue exam's systems no cheating  and no one can dare question the value of their certificates when they give it to you.","You want grind? Fine, go grind in leetCode and HackerRank. Good luck.","**Will Coursera certificates get you a job?** No.  


 **Are they worth it for learning or as a complementary resource to your current study?** Generally, yes, but it depends on the certificate and the issuing entity.    


Personally, I found some certificates from Coursera and edX to be more valuable than my engineering school courses. I agree with the other response that emphasizes the importance of applying what you've learned. So use what you've learned to create projects and build your portfolio. This is what really matters.","The knowledge you gain from these courses are very useful, the certificate, not that much.",2024-01-21 12:14:42

I'm considering whether to move here for the short or medium-term later on, but that's based on many variables.

Anyways, I was trying Tinder while here and managed to get a few matches; I'm not looking for marriage, but not looking for a one-night stand either (I guess fun casual dating or a long-term relationship if possible). I think Tunisian women are quite attractive and I would love to go on some dates, but wanted some advice on dating etiquette here. I, especially as a foreigner, don't want to make any women uncomfortable, but I have a habit of moving too slow (or being too platonic) in my dating history and am trying to fix that.

Basically, how should I approach going on dates with girls in their early-mid 20s here? Is holding hands by the end of the first date too much? First kiss on the second date too fast? Would appreciate opinions from girls themselves on what makes them comfortable but also feel good & adored (obviously I know it can vary a lot). Thanks in advance!

Edit: Just wanted to say although I'm a foreigner, I come from a quite similar culture/religious background so I'm not completely oblivious to Tunisian customs. Let's just say most ppl assume I'm Arab","It's okay we prefer taking it slow here in Tunisia, it would be kinda fast to hold hands in the first date personally (especially if it doesn't click) BUT HEY, whatever goes her way, ask her what she likes or what she wants, if it is okay with her or not..etc.

Relationships are built on communication so don't be afraid to ask her directly.","Well it is all a personal choice, Tunisia is so mentally diverse, you can find a very religious who wouldn’t even go on dates, or someone who have ** regularly. I mean since you’re on tinder, your market will be the open ones. So just communicate to figure out what they give green lights to and what’s not .
The only thing that I want to let you know is maybe some will be fake just to try to get a visa, so that would be your only challenge, is to find someone who genuinely like you, not use you!",Don't date our women. Go to your home.,"Holding hands / kissing or any form of pda is a no no in tunisia, many girls are ""victims"" of regressive traditional  social norms here. So it is best to just be less affectionate or less forward during dates. However, when speaking with girls actually try and ask them what they prefer what they like, what is she ok or not ok with, by doing this you won t need to knlw the general etiquette as you ll be making the person in front of you comfortable.",It's better if keep it safe for the first 3 dates at least try to avoid physical touches cuz the majority here aren't comfortable with it.,2024-01-21 11:23:06

- is uni really the way? I don't feel like I'm getting sufficient value out of it, just alot of general information and useless information with subjects that I won't touch upon again and won't specialize in later on
- I'm going for a master's in data science, that is my goal, but I also have doubts on that — there's alot of through courses that could take me from beginner to intermediate while providing practical knowledge/projects to show later on, and from what I learned, this seems to be the better choice imo.
- I'm really concerned about AI, I don't wanna study for 5 years just to find myself being just another near useless person in a VERY oversaturated market.
- I can dedicate my time to studying what I want ( for example, doing courses on SQL data bases, data science using python and R, supplementing with some math courses) instead of doing 11 subjects that give me much less info over time and with 6 of them being completely irrelevant to me.
- I've done editing for fun for about 7 years and will probably find the time to supplement myself with it as a side gig along with game/web dev along the way.","University is NOT about just studying.. university is about going deep into subjects in a way that it opens your mind , teaches you HOW TO THINK, looking at problems from DIFFERENT ANGLES, how to COMMUNICATE with people, it won’t add to your IQ but it will help your EQ.

I recommend Sidi Bousaid (old town and harbor) & Marsa for the nice views and beautiful coastal breeze. The same goes for Hammamet & Sousse (cliché touristic zones but worth visiting). 
For nature I would go to regions like Beja, Northern coast of Nabeul, Zaghouan since they're not far from the capital. 
If you're willing to go long distances, you will find a lot of nature and historical sites in the middle states like Siliana, Sousse, Sfax...
The South is magical for its desert climate, you will find a lot of oasis, green resorts & hotels that embrace the Saharian theme and provide fun activities like quad biking or camel riding through the dunes etc.

19d3prv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/19d3prv/mental_health_did_therapy_helped_you/,1,Mental health : did therapy helped you?,"
Hey guys, I’ve been dealing with anxiety,depression almost since i was 16 (im 23 now) 
I tried to cure it or reduce it at least by going out and exercising (the gym helped tho) 
But I’ve notice that i might have ADHD and OCD and this is self diagnosis.
Tried also to reduce it or cure it by reading a whole shit about it but it won’t help
I went to spain for 6 months and I thought i was cured because i was doing meditation i always go somewhere relaxing and whenever i feel anxious i go for a swim.
I’m back to tunisia now, and im working , kinda felt my mental health is getting worse as im getting more paranoid, questioning my existence and my purpose of life, hate myself, troubles sleeping nothing makes me happy anymore.
Sorry for the long text, im asking if therapy helped because im thinking of seeing a psychiatrist 
I need recommendations ( Tunis based,manouba)","  I think Mental therapists are scam and mental illness   disappeare Gradually as you change your lifestyle or even some habits , Try to get closer to Allah , do  your prayers , Stop being alone too much and reduce technologie usage .","First there is a difference between psychiatrice and psychologue, psychiatrice i guess is a doctor who graduate through medecine school like any doctor and his treatment will rely on prescribing chemical drugs in the other hand psychologue who is known for the cognitive behavioral treatment he rely on working on reframing your perspective and helping you implement new behaviors. U must choose wich one is better, personaly i see that a doctor psychiatric is responsible for cases like psychosis, paranoia, psychizophrenia, delusional disorder and all hallucination & illogical thinking process. So psychologue is better suitable for ur case. And just use med.tn to find a one.","My sister went to therapy and she had a very successful experience with it (meds worked wonderfully and so quickly) and we’ve all noticed how much it changed her. However me on the other hand, did not help me in the slightest (mind you I refused to take the meds they gave me because I didn’t resonate with the diagnosis) and all the therapy talk was your basic positive pep talk  and life is all flowers and rainbows type bullshit. I feel like it’s hard to find very knowledgeable and professional therapists or psychologists here in Tunisia and I haven’t been to many. The ones I did go to didn’t fully understand modern illnesses and problems like ADHD, Imposter Syndrome, Self Sabotage and so on. I felt like they were very shallow in the way they talk to me and didn’t know how to dig deep or break down what I had expressed. So I think it’s a matter of finding the right therapist if you’ve got enough patience in you to test some out until you find the right fit for you and a matter of personal experience and situations. But it’s worth the try if you’re willing to work on your mental health. I recommend journaling on your own and doing shadow work, and inner child work to understand the root of your problems and start working on healing your mind and spirit.

I live in the Netherlands, but I am happy to receive any information with regards to other countries.

Do you, as residentials of an EU country, own property or money in Tunisia?

How do you pay taxes over this **in your EU country**? If you could give me details, what percentage etc? Any hints to what is relevant can be useful. Don't hesitate.

I am asking this, because I am considering buying crypto's with DT (from the profit of the house in Tunis that were selling ) and selling the cryptos in euro's, in that way I have to pay taxes over crypto profit, which I am happy to do. 

My situation, bear with me:

My dad wants to sell a house in Tunisia (was an investment for the family). He bought/maintained it by mainly by over the years: 1. mainly sending money (from salary) to Tunisia 2. minorly by the rent that was paid over the years.

My dad wants to sell his house in Tunis. When selling, there might be questions (from the Dutch tax organ) where the money is coming from. I don't want him to be fined for 'hiding property' abroad; its complex, because over the years the bi-national agreements have changed. I have double nationality and I am born and resident in Netherlands. My father too. Nobody of us has Tunisian residential status (but we do have the passport/id card)

Thanks for your help!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;",You need a legal consultation with a lawyer well versed in Dutch taxes and bi national agreements,There is a treaty for that.

---------

As a resident of the Netherlands, you are required to declare your worldwide income and assets when filing your Dutch tax return. This includes real estate located abroad, such as a house in Tunisia. However, tax treaties often provide special rules for real estate located outside the Netherlands. Generally, the right to levy tax on real estate is allocated to the country where the real estate is located, not the country of residence of the taxpayer.

For real estate located abroad, you must declare it in your Dutch tax return, but you are entitled to a double taxation relief that equals the Dutch tax burden. This relief is designed to prevent the same income from being taxed twice in two different countries. It's important to note that each case can vary based on specific circumstances and the applicable tax treaty.

In the Netherlands, income from assets such as a second home is taxed in Box 3 of the income tax. There is an exempt amount of €57,000 for Box 3 in 2024, and the tax rate for Box 3 income is 36% [[❞]](https://www.kvk.nl/en/finance/dutch-tax-rates-in-2024/) [[❞]](https://www.iamexpat.nl/housing/real-estate-news/how-does-it-work-taxation-real-estate-netherlands) [[❞]](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/netherlands/individual/taxes-on-personal-income).

It's advisable to consult a tax professional or the Dutch tax authorities for personalized advice and to ensure compliance with all relevant tax laws and treaties.","If you're tax-resident in NL you're going to have to pay taxes.

From what I can understand so far, your father kept the house ownership / revenues ""low-key"" aka hidden so far. This will be a problem. I would consult a tax lawyer as soon as possible both in NL and in Tunisia. Capital outflows in Tunisia through official means are limited, and you're planning to use crypto to bypass that (which I understand) - but that is also a legal gray area. Keep in mind that you're likely going to have to do this peer-to-peer, and with a large sum from a house sale this won't go well with any source of funds verification in NL. And since you've exported currency illegally in Tunisia you won't get help there either (and you technically broke some money laundering regulations in TN).

&#x200B;

TL:DR; way above Reddit's paygrade. You need a tax lawyer in both countries to look over things and try to unfuck the situation.

&#x200B;

It's very possible to keep things under the radar and trickle the crypto over a period of time but again, this is illegal and I won't recommend it, though I expect that's what many people do.","I also live in the Netherlands. Since your resident there (+ have their nationality) you have to submit your annual tax submission (belastingaangifte) in which among many things asked is the question whether you own any property and if so abroad or not and u live in it or not, depending on that last question - u live in it or not - it gets taxed differently (wealth tax or box 3 if u don’t live in it yourself).
So officially speaking you have to declare whether you own any properties abroad/in Tunisia. However, not many declare that when they live in the Netherlands and have property in their home country (outside of the EU). 

If your asking about crypto specifically and the scenario u mentioned; investing in crypto with your dinars? It depends, if at some point in the future you want to cash your crypto profits to your Dutch bank account and it’s more than 10k euros the bank will most likely freeze your money first and ask for proofs of transactions which show u invested/deposited money from your (Dutch) bank account into crypto exchanges to invest in crypto. If u somehow come up with “I actually invested it with money I had stalled abroad” they will most likely become suspicious at the very least of it possibly being a money laundry scheme and u better make sure u can back up everything u claim, specially if it involves money abroad. Meaning u need to save screenshots of transactions/bank transfers of money u deposited in crypto exchanges. If u can show them screenshots of bank transfers of funds into crypto exchanges you most likely will not run into into significant problems with your bank even if your cash huge crypto profits like million(s) of euros. Unless somehow the crypto investments u made (in terms of how much money u put into it) doesn’t match your income (profile) at all and is way sketchy.",2024-01-22 10:06:09

TL;DR: Canadians with 5600.00 TND in cash at risk of loss because exchange bureau cannot legally exange it. We leave Sunday.

Here's the story:

My gf and I (both canadians) brought in around 5820 euros in cash to cover for surgery here. We exchanged this amount into dinars which amounted to approximately 19 620.00 TND to my gf's name (since the operation was for her).

What happened is that out of the 3 planned operations, she ended up having only one (which went really well btw) This resulted in a reimbursement of 10 600 TND cash

The problem happened at the exchange bureau when the clerk told us that we couldn't exchange more than 5000 TND back to euros unless we had a special declaration given by customs upon arrival, which obviously we were completely unaware of.

All of this is very unfortunate and now we have 5600 TND in cash that we cannot bring on the plane by literal risk of imprisonment.

We are both students and she worked very hard to get this operation done (which is for health reasons, not aesthetic) and now we have a large amount of money that we might lose because of this weird governamental quirk.

And all of this after an exhausting week and in the midst of recovery.

We ask if anyone here might know of any solution to this or may be willing to help.

We will stay cheerful and try to enjoy the rest of the week as best we can :)","Je suis canadien aussi, qui sera en Marseille après dimanche, et après 27 avril en Tunisie - alors j’ai besoin les dinars tunisiens.

However, it might take few years or at least months to get there. My question here, how to maintain a long distance relationship?

Distance literally tore us apart. Where feelings weren’t translated properly through texts and phone calls.

It also helps that me and my husband are at the same wavelength (age, stable career, matching personality). We just build the trust overtime and when parents are introduced to the picture, we feel so much at ease.

We generally got no problem with Morocco, and we refer to Moroccans as ""Mrarka"" ever since Marrakech was your capital, so it's not a derogatory term.","You’re marrying her, not her family. I don’t see the issue because that’s more her problem how to deal with her family and not yours. 

And yes her family is a fringe minority. I know many people with Moroccan dads or moms and few who are married with Moroccans and don’t face this type of discrimination. And generally in Tunisia we call Moroccans Marouki Maroukia and the country el Marrouk since Andalusian Spanish people settled in the country more than four centuries ago. And it’s in noway a derogatory slur towards Moroccan, it’s simply our dialect. 

Tunisians generally think highly of your country and people. Tunisians criticism towards politics in Morocco is similar towards any other countries and means no harm to the citizens. Unless a جبري with lack of manners stereotypes people and that doesn’t represent 12 millions of us. 

If your girlfriend loves you and wants to marry you, that’s all what matters here since she’s a free citizen who doesn’t need her family approval when she signs her marriage contract with you.","I can't talk about other Tunisians but we don't have a problem with Moroccans.

“ Wednesday Night Sept. 8 1943

Dear Folks,

It is now just mid-night but I have a story for you tonight and it must be told before I forget a single thing. There is no news, but this story I think will be the most interesting I have ever told. Before I even start, I think that I should tell you how this all came to happen. You see we are living in the summer palace of the Bey of Tunis and a few days ago the man servant of the prince (the Bey is almost a prisoner in Algeria you know during this war) asked me to come up for supper sometime. He had been down a few times before and I gave him some playing cards, gum, cigarettes and etc. Tonight he came down and said the supper was set for this evening and asked me to bring a friend who spoke French so our conversation could be complete, (my French is a bit shaky you know). One of my cooks speaks French fluently so I asked him to go and he of course accepted (who could refuse an invitation like that?). Now to go on to the story after this short introduction.

We were led into the palace grounds by our escort, past the guard into a beautiful garden. Palm trees, orange trees (?), flowers ( which I cannot tell you the name) and a large pond where there were the largest gold fish I have ever seen in my life. Each flower bed was in a different design separated by little cement walls about 4 inches high and decorated with all kinds of sea shells. It must have taken years just to build these alone. The flowers were not very numerous because this is the dry season but what there were was certainly beautiful. We sat down in a beautiful lounge and waited for the evening gun. As I told you in my last letter, this is the month for fasting in the Arab religion and no one eats until the sun-set gun is fired as a signal that the day is done and that evening, the time for feasting is at hand. After the signal, we were escorted into a small room in one corner of the palace. There, the table was set with the most modern dishes I have seen in many months. Before each place were piled at least 8 or 10 dishes. It was there that we met the Prince for the first time.

He is a very young man, I should say about 18 or 19 years of age. After certain formalities, we were seated as follows, at the head of the table sat the prince and his body guard, at the foot, myself. On my right was my guest and on my left, a French army colonel. The French officer was an honorary member of the Beys guard before the war and still stays near the prince. The story about the supper is going to knock some of the stories you hear about the Arabs into a coched hat. The servants consisted of one Arab girl not veiled and several black boys who waited on table and also waved those large black fans to keep the flies away. It was exactly as you see in the movies. So much for the setting of the dinner although I must say this before we go further, the Arabs do not just use their right hand for eating, they use both hands just as you and I. The dinner itself was one of the most delicious meals I have ever eaten and I shall describe each course and how I think it was made.

The first course consisted of what the Arabs call breek, that’s not how you spell it but I shall write all the names as how they are pronounced. Breek is try-covered French pastry of which the filling is made of fried egg and some sort of dressing. It’s delicious to say the least and is almost a meal in itself.

The second course consisted of chicken soup to which kooo-kooo and barly had been added. This also was very delicious. (Just remember that each one of these courses that I am telling you about right now is served in a separate dish which is piled in front of you before the dinner).

The third course was lamb (and this time I ate it) It was prepared something like how the Russians prepare Schoslich only instead of using tomatoes, a bread dressing is used and it is broiled over an open spit. It is very highly seasoned but very tender and sweet.

Our fourth course was the good old favourite of many, roast chicken with dressing and hard boiled eggs and French fried potatoes used as a garnish. It was as brown as a not and so tender you could really pick the meat off with your fork. Of course it was roasted in oil but it must have been a very high grade of oil because the taste was perfect, not that oily taste you usually have. The sliced eggs and French fries were just used as decorations.

The fifth course was the most unusual I have ever seen or tasted. It consisted of an olive salad of which peppers, onions, garlic and a few other vegetables had been added and looked something like our pepper relish. I enjoyed mine very much although no one else seemed to care for it.

The sixth course was the country’s favourite and should I have to tell you, it was kooo-kooo. It was the most beautiful dish on the table, about as large as your head and trimmed with cold sliced chicken, peppers, eggs, olives, and citron. The kooo-kooo itself is seasoned with a very hot sauce but because I like hot peppers, sauce and ect. I enjoyed it very much.

Our seventh course was certainly something new and different. In arabic it is pronounced like this, Ou vache and looks something like chopped spinach rolled into little balls. The vegetable was strange to me but the meat sauce and ground meat over it was delicious.

The last course was an Arabic dessert called Ma-hed-ach and looks something like our apple Brown Betty. It is made with some kind of an arab cookie to which is added a white sauce. The flavor is almost impossible to describe although after I had eaten all this dinner I still accepted seconds. I guess that tells its own story dosent it? I might say though that never before have I ever eaten such a rich or sweet dessert.

By this time, our plates were used up and the table was bare except for a bowl of iced grapes and a large dish of almonds. These were to be munched as we carried on our after dinner conversation.","Part 2.

Because this letter is turning out to be much longer than I had expected, I won’t tell you much about the conversation. The French Colonel was a very brilliant man and had traveled quite a bit, the Prince of course had studied in France and has also traveled quite a bit. The best part of the whole evening was that we did not talk about the war, nor how our army compared with theirs. My little knowledge of French did help me get most of the conversation though and what I didn't understand, the prince and colonel were kind enough to let my interpreter tell me what they were talking about. After about an hour of this pleasing talk, the prince asked us if we would like to see the Beys own room and that starts another story of which I shall have to be brief because to tell the whole story it would take hours and hours not to mention the time and paper.

It was a room about 40 ft square and right in the center hung a candleabra or Chandelier which had hung there a 125 years. I have seen many that were much larger but none as pretty or ornamental. It held you spell-bound for a minute, the floor was almost covered with scatter rugs, occidental and occidental that must have cost thousands and thousands of dollars. At one end of the room was the Beys own gold chain surrounded by plush divano and over stuffed chains. All around the room were chairs and divano of various colors, each a distinctive set of color scheme. The clocks deserve a word because I saw several all made of gold and were hundreds of years old. Some of them were made in France and some in Switzerland and one of them in particular I noticed had to be wound only once a year. Mother, the vases would hold you spell-bound for minutes. Their beauty was something that no words could describe. All hand made and hand colored and many of them have been in the family for generations. There is one picture (one of the many) I must tell you about before I leave and that is a hand drawn picture in charcoal that is over twice the size of the Bey himself. It was done by a native arab and took over 2 years to complete. It is more realistic than any painting I have ever seen and just commands your attention for quite a few moments.

That's all I can tell you about the palace itself on paper but if you were only here I could talk for over an hour more at least. I'll tell you the rest sometime when we have all settled down some evening over a pan of pop corn and a glass of sweets cider.

After leaving the Beys room we were escorted back to the dining room which by this time had been converted back to a luxurious lounge room and were served arabian coffee. The coffee itself was good although quite a bit different than ours but again I thought of you mother when I saw those petite cups and saucers. You would gladly have traded a war bond for a set of 6 of them. The cups were white china trimmed with gold and only held about an ounce and a half.

Anyways",We need more details. Please make them juicy. Have a seat and don’t leave anything behind and let’s talk,"I worked with multiples. I had good and bad experiences. I think that it has to do more with how typical Tunisiens are and not the type of work. Most people are toxic, scammers,  they get jealous for some reason and want to destroy you at all cost even if you are not threatening their work position by any means.  

I'm so sorry about the consultant part, i was close to having the same outcome but luckily they discovered that stealing project money from beneficiaries is more lucrative than stealing it from a few consultants.",Money + power x ego,"It's not only in Tunisia though, but around the world. NGO, like companies, unfortunately magnets toxicity and misplaced egos.   
Particular mention of Tunisia's youth associations is just a way for very rich kids to pretend to care about poor people.  
The most upvoted comment sums up what I believe happened. I will give you some pieces of advice for participating in NGO's (or work simply)  


1. Care about the cause, not the people: if your goal is to make friends, Ngo's and associations are the worst and magnet a lot of very shitty people If you want to join one for the greater good, join one whose values match with yours
2. Feign ignorance and stupidity: An intelligent person is a person who is threatening. Feign being stupid and clueless is a good way to avoid vultures around you
3. Don't do more than what is asked of you
4. Don't be honest with your coworkers: By that I don't mean to be a snake, but just don't tell them what you think. Showing emotions are for friends, not for coworkers and bosses. If you struggle to do so, just learn to tell them to fuck themselves without telling them to fuck themselves directly
5. Always be meticulous when it comes to contracts and anything you need to sign. Read them carefully, and take your time before signing. If you are pressured by your peers, return to point 2., feign ignorance, gain time to not sign. When they are legally weird, it's a big red flag 
6. Dress correctly and have a neutral style at work: Most people  will never take seriously that don't conform to the norms, even if he is competent
7. Do not let yourself being stepped on: If you feel someone is about or trying to fuck you, feign ignorance, do not trust them, and return to point 2. Don't confront them, just say "" oh, maybe, okay"" and then forget.","It's not related to NGO's, but more related to Tunisian culture.

We started chatting online, and she always kept our conversations lively, even when I wasn't fully engaged.

As we got closer, I noticed a kind of game happening – she's quite good at it, using clever moves that often leave me guessing. I admit, I can't always figure out what she's up to, making her quite clever. It's like a chess match, and as I write this, I find myself feeling a bit vulnerable.

I see myself as someone who doesn't like playing with people's feelings, but surprisingly, I made a promise to marry a woman who's skilled at this kind of game. And she's the one I have in mind.

However, there are some concerns. My recent interest in religion has made me question her lifestyle. I believe in personal freedom, but I've always dreamed of having a family with someone smart and noble.

Red flags start to appear, though. She identifies as a feminist, not interested in marriage or having kids – something I really desire. She drinks, which is something I've never done, and she has many guy friends, which goes against my principles.

Despite these worries, her intelligence and commitment to her principles continue to captivate me. It's a bit of a puzzle – I might overlook these issues if she's willing to reconsider certain aspects of her lifestyle. But there's an ethical dilemma – I don't want to manipulate her feelings, especially since she seems more inclined towards non-committal relationships.

In this internal struggle between my feelings and thoughts, these reflections offer a glimpse into my personality and values. I'm sharing them openly, hoping to receive respectful insights from you on this mix of emotions and values.",More red flags here than in USSR rally. Actually nothing other than red flags.

I don't like dating, I tend to become friends with men easily but I put boundaries at the first sign of interest if I am not interested or they aint fit for a serious relationship. I personally didnt see the point being who I am and since unfortunately whenever I gave someone a chance he never seemed to respect my boundaries.
I don't drink, and don't really like to frequent clubs..  there is no chance I meet someone at work currently, and most events I go to seem to be full of ppl who are not eligible (way younger, still seem immature, already in a relationship, or really not inerested just there for the event hhh)
I have not really been actively trying to meet men, always believed in fate.. but there is so much I still wanna do in life it's just I wld rather share it with a significant other and I feel like nowadays especially being in my late 20s it's hard to find a match

Looking for different insights or shared experiences from men or women..  be respectful or just don't comment","Above 25M here. It's really tough but god keeps the best for last nshalah, as a practising muslim too that avoids clubs, bars and cafes and on the look in some of the following places, these could maybe work for you:

1- Lessons in the mosque or quranic classes or after prayers in mosques, especially friday prayer. You might meet a guy there.

2- Volunteering clubs.

3- Friends reference, if your friends know your preferences you might want to ask them if they know someone that you might like.

4- Gym. Most of the respectable guys go as early as 6-7am to the gym or late after the workshift.

5- Same age family members, maybe your cousins that are close to your age know someone?

6- Old friends from school before. Maybe a guy that you knew before in school.

7- Social media, very risky but chkoun ya3ref lmaktoub kifech raby yjibo.

8- Attend some family of friends' weddings maybe? Although I personally dislike this but back in the day that's how people generally met their spouses.

9- Arranged by family, quite a taboo in our society but you can always refuse the guy if you don't like him, no one is allowed to force you to marry anyone either in religion or in the law too. The law stands with you in this one.

19eg2zq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/19eg2zq/are_tunisian_communities_descending_from_foreign/,1,Are Tunisian communities descending from foreign countries common?,"I know a friend of mine whose mother is Russian and I feel quite lucky to know him, yet whenever I go out with him or he tells me he's going somewhere he gives me the impression that the Russian-Tunisian community is larger than I thought. My great grandmother (الله يرحمها) also descends from an andalusian family but I don't think that really influences me or anyone else like me as much as someone whose family is french or American. What I want to know is what other subgroups from foreign countries or ethnic groups (far ones) are present in the regular Tunisian life. I also would like to know if anyone in this subreddit descends from a foreign country or ethnicity or moved here","The main foreign communities in Early Modern Tunisia (I chose that time frame because descent from them is much more confidently tracked down than from the Medieval period) were :

1- The Andalusian communities expelled by the Spanish and Portuguese. They mainly settled in major coastal towns as well as founded villages all over the Mejerda Valley. The vast majority of them integrated into larger local communities over time and the only thing remaining from them is their last names (al-Andulsi), a few toponyms (Kalaat-al-Andalus) and a few Spanish words here and there.

2- Jewish communities from Iberia who were also expelled by the Spanish and Portuguese. They mainly settled in major coastal towns and merged with local Jewish communities and are credited with reviving Jewish culture in the region after its near-extinction under the Almohads. They largely adopted the Judeo-Arabic (instead of Ladino) of the local communities but their traditions largely dominated that of local communities (with exceptions like the community in Djerba and the interior). Most of them left the country in the 60s and 70s to France and Israel.

3- Turks, Cretan Greeks, Balkan Muslims, Circassians ... All collectively known locally as ""Turks"". They settled in the country during the Ottoman period. Many of them were former soldiers who were given land near prominent Northern garrison in the Northwest and Cape Bon. They were originally set apart from the rest of the population during the Muradid period for following the Hanafi school of fiqh (unlike the Maliki school followed by the locals and Andalusians) but those in major cities eventually started intermarrying with local families and those in rural communities started taking local wives and eventually they got assimilated with the only things remaining being their last names (Bushnak, Abazi ...), a few toponyms (Hammam Ghezèze), some unique mosque architecture and a few Turkish words and grammatical structures here and there.

4- Sub-Saharan Africans from the Sahel and Sudan region (not to be confused with the Tunisian Sahel and the country of Sudan). Many of them were brought as slaves from pagan Chadic-speaking populations in what is today Northern Cameroon and Nigeria, but a significant number settled here as traders too (especially from Hausa city states). They partially integrated in larger Tunisian society though they are arguably still a visible minority (depending on where you live and how extensive they mixed).

5- Southern Europeans, mainly from Italy and Malta. The vast majority of Christians both during the Ottoman and French periods were from Southern Europe, they were Catholic and settled in distinct isolated communities especially in the capital and a few coastal trade centers. They didn't integrate in larger Tunisian society due to their religious affiliation and most left after independence. Many were also descended from European converts (like Qaid el Sebsi family) or slaves captured by Barbary pirates, these two largely integrated into larger society through joining the Turkish class of the country.

6- Communities from the rest of the Arab world, sorta ? Well calling most of them foreign is debatable. My paternal family originates from Nefta and we do have ancestors ""from Algeria"", but if we gonna be honest, are people from Oued Suf or Ouregla (who spoke almost the exact same dialect and were very close geographically) more ""foreign"" to people from Nefta than people in Sousse or Bizerte ? The notion of a Tunisia distinct from Algeria and Libya didn't really exist at the time aside from political administrative units that frequently changed and got re-drawn. For every ""Trabelsi"" in Sousse you will find ten ""Gafsis"" and ""Karouis"" both of whom have no relation to Gafsa or Kairouan aside from a direct paternal ancestor who moved from there centuries ago.

When it comes to numbers, they are impossible to get. Your average Tunisian probably has a few ancestors from those groups, but there is a difference between ""25% of the population has some Andalusian ancestor in his family tree"" and ""25% of the population is descended from Andalusians"". At the end of the day, those immigration waves brought a number of people that was quite small relative to the rest of the local population, and many of them didn't integrate and moved out eventually. So it is complicated.","During the crimean war and Bolshevik revolution, tens of thousands of Russians settled in Tunisia and integrated with the population and this explains the plenty Russian orthodox churches in Tunisia especially in Tunis and Bizerte (the port where they landed). Today their descendants are probably around 2-5% of the population, my own guess. 

Turkic people and their descendants are approx 2 millions in Tunisia, according to Wikipedia and other sources. 

Andalusian have settled in the north west regions especially Beja and Bizerte. 

Arab, Libyan and Amazighi nomad tribes in the south. 

Sicilians around Cap Bon and Tunis. 

Small Greeks communities settled in Djerba, Kerkennah, Sfax and Sousse.  

Moroccans have mainly settled in Zaghouan, Sahel and in the past century in Gafsa when the french brought many from the phosphate mines of Morocco to teach the local the extraction. 

Algerians have settled in Gafsa, Kasserine, Siliana. Kabyle in El Kef and Jendouba. 

Indigenous people and Jews were all over the place and some waves of Andalusian Jews have settled in North West in the 15 century and another wave from Livorno, Italy have settled in Tunis and Sousse in the 17th century. 

Malians and Sudanese make the significant groups amongst black Tunisians, many came to settle for the Sudanese (recently 200 years ago) and for the Malians their arrival was mostly due to 800 years of slave trade caravans. They are based in Nafta, Gabes and Zarzis. The major ports and transit points for the trade. 

Unlike western Europe and America, Tunisians have mixed up so well for centuries with waves of immigrants/ settlers that we don’t have specific numbers but we can tell from the diet, clothing and traditional music where the diversity came from. Read histoire de la tunisie by Sophie Bessis to know more about this.","I am half German. As a toddler, I almost exclusively played with other German children. There was a small Christmas fest with a santa and other small events. My mom had weekly meetups with other German friends, they even have a club.  
Still, a very very small community and culture (which I don't like tbh, you're either this or that, having a completely new culture makes you quite lonely).

# Ligne ferroviaire Sousse-Kasserine : Reprise prévue en 2026

Par [**Amal BOU OUNI**](https://lapresse.tn/author/amalbououni/)Publié sur 22/01/2024📷

***Des études préliminaires de faisabilité technique et d’efficacité ont été achevées depuis***  ***juin 2018. Rapide et rentable, cette ligne ferroviaire aura certainement un impact important sur le développement des activités économiques de toute la région du centre du pays.***

Le gouverneur de Kasserine, Ridha Rokbani, a annoncé il y a quelques jours  le lancement de la première phase de réhabilitation de la ligne ferroviaire reliant Sousse à Kasserine. Le projet consiste à construire une nouvelle section et la restauration des voyages est prévue pour 2026.

La ligne ferroviaire Sousse- Kasserine, qui date de 1909, a été conçue essentiellement pour l’exploitation de la plante d’alfa. Cependant, depuis 1969, le tronçon liant Kairouan fut coupé en raison des inondations, avant d’être entièrement fermée en 1982, suite à la construction du barrage Sidi Saâd.

#### En phase d’étude

Le projet de restauration a été, alors, programmé, depuis 2012. Selon l’Instance générale de partenariat public-privé (Igppp), le fonds budgétaire qui sera alloué est estimé à 550 millions de dinars sans le matériel roulant. Des études préliminaires de faisabilité technique et d’efficacité ont été achevées depuis  juin 2018 selon l’Igppp. D’après la même source, la Société nationale des chemins de fer de Tunisie (Sncft) est actuellement en train de se concerter sur les études de conception détaillées en collaboration avec le ministère du Transport avant de lancer un appel d’offres pour les travaux.

Rapide et rentable, cette ligne ferroviaire aura certainement un impact important sur le développement des activités économiques de toute la région du centre du pays. Ceci est vrai, dans la mesure où elle pourrait « relier les mines de phosphates de Sra Ouertane et Jadliane aux ports de Skhira, Sousse et le futur port en eaux profondes d’Enfidha, tout en desservant l’aéroport d’Enfidha et les zones industrielles de Kairouan, de Kasserine et de Sidi Bouzid », lit-on dans la fiche technique dudit projet.

Ce projet n’est qu’une composante d’un investissement énorme que la Tunisie fait dans le secteur du transport ferroviaire qui envisage même de lancer une étude sur la ligne africaine. La Sncft prévoit la réhabilitation et la rénovation de 600 km de lignes ferroviaires dont la plupart sont abandonnées et situées à l’intérieur du pays. Un ensemble de 47 projets d’infrastructures pour un total d’investissements estimés à 68 milliards de dinars a déjà été annoncé et la plupart des réformes seront réalisées à l’horizon 2040.

Rappelons que la Sncft gère déjà un réseau de 23 lignes d’une longueur totale de 2.153 km. Elle transporte aussi bien des voyageurs que des marchandises.",in Tunisia if something is projected to one year ahead you better forget about it it's either it's going to takes ages or not gonna happen and if it does finally happen it's gonna be like: WTF?,A century late but that’s really good.

You probably have heard of him but just in case I will do a tldr: 

He wants to completely open an Economy like ours (which I find good but not the way he pöans to do it) 



He wants to Dollarize  the economy (so no more Argentine  pesos but rather USD this is bad tho in my opinion) 


He wants to eventually drastically reduce tax and subsidies (really good in my opinion but the way he is doing it is bad) 


Nobody will agree with his Pro-Israel views here. At least not the Majority and he wants less regulation (they also have quite some big monopolies in Argentina)


Honestly I kinda see good and bad in him. He is definitely crazy but I think we might want to open the economy because the situation is really holding back some people in Tunisia even though the country gives a lot of not so bad alternatives because thank god we aren’t at 3digit inflation.

But what worries me is that Argentines might be in a lot of ways more educated than the lower class Tunisians that can’t do anything but basic jobs. And I don’t want them to starve like people in Argentina are even though we aren’t mich better on individual wealth because of their black market.


Anyways what are your thoughts…


I think Tunisia isn’t exactly losing out on people like Farmers and Shepherds to be honest they are however not able to hold the engineers they are producing. Now my worries is that those low paying jobs are not going to be enough.


Farmers elsewhere are more productive or/and subsidized by richer countries and institutions. 


And I have recently learned that countries such as Sweden were extremely capitalistic and hardworking and only turned into a welfare state when they got rich after the industrial revolution. 

What‘s your opinion guys?

And let’s keep this civil

Hello Tunisian reddit, 
A very serious and urgent family matter came up and i need to be in sfax by tomorrow, i already booked the flight, I leave tonight and I'll arrive to Tunis-Carthage Airport around 3~4 AM.

I've never used the public transport in Tunis and I don't know my way around the capital, also I don't have anyone who can pick me up from the airport and drive me home.

Please can someone explain to me all the possible ways to get to sfax using the public transport (bus, train, louage...) where to get them in the capital and where i get dropped off in sfax.

My guess is i'll have to wait in the airport until it starts getting bright out, then take a taxi to a station and go from there...","you can still find taxis 3-4 am , if not near the airport , then Bolt it is; taxi to ""Moncef Bay louage station"" then louage to Sfax","It depend when you arrive, unfortunately there is no other transport beside public one, you need to get a bus or micro-bus.","Dont use the taxis in the airport, they will scam you and overcharge you.

And let me be real, I've literally learned nothing in my two years of this Cs liscence. The professors just read through the course material and bounce.

I once commented that it would be great if we carried on with the lesson as politely as I could, he surely didnt recieve that well, and didn't change ofc. So on another occasion I said fuck it and engaged with his dumb story and ended up proving him wrong in front of the whole class.  

He always made me sit in the last row, and ask me to stop talking randomly and the next time I should just leave the classroom (mind you I was alone in the whole row, I can't talk to anyone even if I wanted) he kept doing that until once he just told me to not attend his class for the rest of the year, and he was the only teacher teaching that subject for the whole PT prepa, so I can't attend any other class.  

It is funny whenever i remember his fragile ego, even in confinement he taught the whole class online and made sure i was removed from microsoft teams and that none should give me any ressource.

1abizcr,https://i.redd.it/qhwp5vhbjsec1.jpeg,48,بداية النهاية,We are dead. Thanks for electing the current government and destroying our country. Next generations will curse you. Also expect a new revolution in few years.,"For those who don't get it, the central bank will be able to give money to the goverment, by mainly printing money.

&#x200B;

Printing money means that the goverment (or central bank) is lowering the value of the money we have, because simply more dinars circulating means the dinars are worth less. This is known as inflation, the dinar is worth less (even locally) so that means everyone will have to raise the prices while the salaries haven't really gone up, it's just the goverment cheating in the game of how money works in modern time.

&#x200B;

There are exceptional situations where the goverment can print money without causing this. For example the goverment can use the new money for investments that generate more value (we have new things to buy so the money doesn't lose its value), but if the goverment uses this to pay loans or salaries, it means that the goverment is actively stealing your money not by actually stealing the papers you have but by printing more so that the ones you have are worth less.

&#x200B;

The only guarantee we have (or had) that this doesn't happen, is keeping the central bank independent and autonomous, so the central bank doesn't pay for the failures of the goverment and it's responsible for controlling inflation.","Ah noooo !!!!

This may result in hyperinflation","![gif](giphy|HUkOv6BNWc1HO)

Doesn't it require at least some sort of court order in Tunisia? Can people with connections do it easily/illegally?

How safe is our phone-number-related private info, really? Is it possible, per Tunisian law, to sue a telecommunication service provider for not protecting said info?

I appreciate any input.","GPT 4 Turbo :  

The protection of personal data in Tunisia is regulated by the Organic Law No. 2004-63, dated 27 July 2004, on the protection of personal data. This law established the National Authority for the Protection of Personal Data (INPDP), which is responsible for ensuring that personal data is processed according to the legal provisions.

According to this law, personal data, such as phone numbers, should be processed lawfully and fairly, collected for specific, explicit, and legitimate purposes, and should not be further processed in a way incompatible with those purposes. The data should be protected against unauthorized access, accidental loss, or damage.

Telecommunication service providers, like other entities that handle personal data, have a legal obligation to implement appropriate security measures to protect the data they manage. If a service provider fails to protect personal data, such as phone numbers, and this results in harm or damage to the individual concerned, it could potentially be grounds for legal action.

If an individual believes that their phone number or other personal data has not been adequately protected, they could file a complaint with the INPDP. The INPDP has the authority to investigate complaints, issue warnings, and impose sanctions on entities that violate data protection laws.

To proceed with a lawsuit, it would be advisable for the affected individual to consult with a Tunisian lawyer who specializes in data protection law to assess the case's merits and guide them through the legal process. The lawyer can provide specific advice on whether there are grounds to sue, based on the details of the case and the current Tunisian legal framework.

&#x200B;

Short answer is yes you can sue them, but it depends on the circumstances of the data breach","I don't think that kind of protection exist in tunisia, didn't hear before of group consumers sued a big company for its services or products.

Récemment, mon frère a consulté son ophtalmologue qui lui a recommandé de changer les verres de ses lunettes, car il a des difficultés à voir clairement de près en raison d'une myopie de -8 et -9 pour les deux yeux respectivement.

Lors de la visite chez l'opticien, nous avons appris que le prix des verres s'élève à environ 550 DT pour une paire standard et 750 DT pour une paire avec des verres moins épais, offrant ainsi une esthétique plus agréable.

Personnellement, je trouve que les tarifs sont assez élevés et je souhaite recueillir vos avis à ce sujet.

Il est important de noter que mon frère, âgé de 14 ans, recherche des lunettes qui soient esthétiquement plaisantes, afin d'éviter l'aspect peu attrayant que peuvent parfois avoir les lunettes. ( qu'elle ne soit pas lunette قاع دبوزة)

It's a bit puzzling why Tunisians who manage to move abroad for things like studying or working start acting strangely when talking about their home country. They act as if they're living in a much better place like Switzerland or Sweden when asked about Tunisia. When they visit, they act like tourists, saying how great it is to live there, even though they left for their own reasons. Strangely, they discourage friends from moving abroad, saying it's not as easy or good as it seems (even though it's better than living here).

It seems like we only appreciate our country once we've left it. When we're in Tunisia, many of us wish to leave, understanding how tough and messy it can be. Personally, I believe you can care about your homeland without exaggerating. Choosing to live abroad is a decision made for various reasons, and going back to live in Tunisia might not be an easy choice given the challenges you left behind.

 ","First things first, never ever in your life make assumptions based on random cases that you extrapolate to put everyone in the same basket, that will make you look less short minded.

Now, I know multiple tunisians that elected to move elsewhere, some never comeback not even for vacations, some comeback for family, others plans to retire here…

I don’t think any one of them is being hypocrite, as Tunisia is really a great place. We have wonderful food, great beaches, nice nature, great historical sites. Life in Tunisia is way easier than in most countries.

Also consider the fact that Tunisians living abroad behave as representative of the country, they try to help by encouraging foreigners to either visit or invest in here, do you think that by bashing the country, it will serve us?

Saying so doesn’t mean Tunisia is heaven on earth neither that it is the best place on the planet. There are multiple issues (mainly economical and social related), but for many of us, it’s the most convenient, it’s our Home! Why should we say anything bad about it?","Simple answer, Tunisia is great and amazing when you HAVE money. And a shithole when you are poor. Most people working aboard will come for vacation with enough money to enjoy their stay, and that changes their whole view of the country's state.","I was one of them and came back….

You're a man or a woman ? And age ?

A man is always more open to repair and go to mechanicians, so you can accept a little bit older car for a better performance. A better for a woman to buy a newer car but less performant, generally they don't mind it. 

Your age will also define if you're into a citadine coupe or a berline , or even a compact car. I do not think you think about SUVs with that price.

Usage : 

If you're having regular long trips, you'll need a car with a certain good horsepower, and maybe a turbo charged engine. If you're more into city driving, then an atmospheric engine would be perfect. 

Car dimensions : 

Never neglect car dimensions, if you're into having family/friends with you , a small car will get destroyed, a large car is a must to keep the interior always in a good condition.

Selling price : 

consider that you'll need to buy it one day, then chose a car that will keep at least 70% of its price, old cars and rare models can not ensure that. 

Maintenance : 

Consider that you will have an annual bugdet for maintenance, asian cars are very expensive in maintenance as spare parts are sold only in official shops. French and german cars are easy to find spareparts in local market.

Finally i'll give you this shortlist sorted from best option to worst according to me, at the budget of 40K: 

Polo 8

Fiat Tipo 1.4

BMW Serie 1 ( old model ) 

Polo sedan 1.4

SEAT Leon (old)

Agriculture having negative growth and Gdp growth being slowly positive can still mean that the Agriculture sector slowed everything down.

Why didn’t he proceed by giving the growth or other sectors? And if he refuted the government theory that it isn’t about ONLY Agriculture which is a fair point. He cannot just explain the result according to fiscal plns only…

(Un facteur parmi d’autres = about 10% of value added as percent of gdp)


Bruh than he says that cutting down on Imports is the reason. But does he know how the treasury looks like during that period of the year. 

Because I remember that during that IMF Tunisia period where everyone was asking why we shouldn’t scrap the subsidies  we had 14 days worth of foreign currencies.


9al konna naamlou 33% mel tawrid what the fuck does that mean? we were basing our gdp on processing our imports to have them be sold at a fraction of the price. And before 2023 imported on debts.

Yeah sure with that formula you will see higher numbers but in reality we were loosing money in absolute terms. 

1. By Taking on debt.

2. By essentially giving those imports to end consumers at a loss

(Example like electricity we buy gas from abroad and still subsidize it luckily We got enough Algerian foreign currency from tourists but still this isn’t the case with euros or dollars) 

Unemployment granted but this is in my opinion barely the responsibility of the state please let’s not shout Kais dabrelna khedma he isn’t here to look for jobs especially not in the already bureaucratic government. Tunisian Central bank could decrease interest rates to increase internal business development but that would also increase inflation (we will complain as usual) moreover only conglomerate do invest in such thing Tunisians only take credit de consommation to party in Billionaire.



Anyways the thing that I don’t get in his logic is that he is comparing our economic performance in 2016 or 2020 to now but that problem with the IMF have been that we took on a lot of debt during that period (debt didn’t start now) and that made us end up in this situation now. So in his right mind he cannot say we never reached this….

No way we aren’t producing energy or technology and need to import them… we fucking have been deindustrializing and the government only objective is getting a proper industry that doesn’t rely on imports.

Like the phosphate that came back strong this year. But we might need to look for something more sustainable

I don't know where to start but let us give it a try. When I feel nostalgic I go back to the clip here (from 15:00 to 18:00) 

https://youtu.be/8zrwyNgIkD8?si=UxmcpJI9K0Ecme2I

where Mouna Noureddine is dying and asking Azzouz to go and visit La3fif in Tunis and asking Mostfa to sell the sheep she owns and pay for the costs of the funeral and then giving the rest of the money to La3fif when he is back. 

What she didn't know at that time is that La3fif was gone and that he wouldn't come back to Tunisia until 20 years later. I see the feelings of a mother who didn't spend her last years in life with her only son who was directly a victim of French occupation of Tunisia. I see how she says ""ma temchi limna w lisra illa b godret rabbi"" (everything is in the hands of God). You can read 10000 books or you can listen to those few words of her and keep them as your motto in life. 

It gives me the feeling that everything will end sooner or later. It makes me envy those men who lived in that era. It makes me hate my postmodern life where I have to work with people with whom I share nothing and whom I see as very superficial human beings who have no idea what life is about. 

Then again, it is always easier to live in nostalgia because I am pretty sure that the fellaga didn't love their lives that much either. And I am pretty sure that in 2045 I will look back at these days now and say ""oh God those were really good days"". 

The philosophical question to ask and which I was among the first philosphers to ask back in my days is: why is it impossible to live the present time from a future perspective?","I guess most people have it way better today than they had it 20 years ago. Most people back then didn't have the basics whilst today a family that doesn't have a washing machine is considered poor. That being said, nostalgia is a very natural human feeling so I understand that people feel it. 

In all this I find the picture of the man in the painting a very typical picture of any ""3amek Jilani el 3attar"" in any Tunisian houma in the 90s.

I'm a 28M Palestinian/Jordanian planning a visit next month to Tunisia. 

I want to go from Tunis to Djebra, and I see that the best way to do it is via Train to Gabes and then Louage to Djebra. 

My questions:

1) is that really the easiest way?

2) according to the website of the train provider, there's a train that leaves Tunis at 21:15 and arrives to Gabes at 04:07. How reliable is that? And at what time louage's start their trips to Djebra?

3) In general, how reliable are the (night) train schedules?

4) when do louage's operate in general? (From what time to what time)

5) to go from Gabes to Kairouan, the best way is Gabes - Sousse (Train) and then louage, or louage directly from Gabes? 

6) when I read a price of 24800 for example, is this 24.8 dinars?

now my problem is: even if you do succeed and restrain yourself from going abroad like everyone in your family probably recommends, you can't do all the things you probably could if you were living in europe for instance. here are a few examples:

\- only one climbing gym in the whole of tunisia and it's very mediocre

\- no where to buy good heavy board games like terraforming mars and whatnot","Niche hobbies didn't pop out of nowhere in the developed world. 

It took passionate people to organise clubs and raise awareness about their hobby in order for them to establish ""climbing gyms"" for example, and once more people got interested in that activity, capitalism saw an opportunity and set up private gyms.

You could apply the same logic to board games or any other hobbies. 

Granted, setting yourself up for such an adventure is 10x more difficult in Tunisia (for reasons we all know), but I'm pretty sure it'll be extremely rewarding. 

Just think of camping 20 years ago, very little people did it compared to now where you have all the information you need, there are massive Facebook groups and lots of people are into it. It took passionate people a lot of time to make that activity mainstream and it paid off.

What I'm trying to say is, when something is missing here we should just try to make it happen. Organise yourself with people who share your passion and hopefully you'll achieve what you're looking for.","For me it's the lack of good quality clothes and shoes.

Also I got to know a lot of tunisians here and I hear a lot of stories like, I went to invest in tunisia but it was hard, everyone is putting a stick in your wheel, people don't want the good for you, everyone just thinks about himself, 

And that's one part I started hating about tunisia, the people, I am aware that there are a lot of good people also, but I feel corruption took over, and I feel I won't be comfortable living in Tunisia even if I had decent money, so my thoughts of living in tunisia are diminishing slowly.

My idea of improving Tunisia a bit is to make a good infrastructure for the youths, parks, bouldering parks, calisthenics parks, games for children in parks.
Here in Germany you always see children, with their parents or without going to these parks, they play, learn, grow and develop themselves, that hearts me when I remember how I had friends in Tunisia with a nice mindset to do stuff like calisthenics with very limiting equipments.

I believe if we provide that to the youth they will slowly resort to less corruption, they will be putting their energy somewhere good, and that slowly will lead to a better future in the long run.

But I wonder sometimes how the government will react to me doing this kind of stuff. Will they support me or send me back to Germany, because I heard a lot of stories of things like this happen.",2024-01-28 09:40:01

1ae5vb5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1ae5vb5/islam_is_cancer/,0,Islam is cancer,"Examining global conditions reveals that regions embracing Islam often experience significant poverty, intense tribal conflicts, unimaginable atrocities, human rights violations, blatant bigotry, and gender inequality.
When discussing these matters, individuals may be labeled as promoting ""Islamophobia"" or, more broadly, ""Racism,"" when criticizing Islam. Criticism is often met with accusations of being a white supremacist, a new age colonizer, or a racist, despite the irony that Islam is an ideology, not a race, albeit a controversial one.
Sure, all religions share face similar issues, like not aligning with a contemporary, scientific, fact-based understanding of reality, appearing outdated, and conflicting with modern values, as well as being blatantly false. But none other has the same morbid characteristics as Islam does. Christianity used to be similar, but Christians tamed their own delusions to make them compatible with the modern world. Muslims have failed to follow suit. The reality is that Islam has hindered development in Muslim countries. While the Middle East may have been a scientific hub centuries ago, it's not a big deal in the present.
Also as a side note, most of the prominent Islamic golden age scholars, such as Ibn Rushd (Averroes) and Ibn Sina (Avicenna) belonged to the sect of Mutazilla, whose interpretations on Quran are being staunchly rejected by today's Islamic communities. Islamic ""Golden age"" was the result of liberal interpretation of Islam powered by the sect of Mutazilla, before mentally deficient individuals such as Al Hanbali and Al Ghazali paved way for Wahhabism.
Muslims have doomed themselves by reversing their own developement as society by following a shitty, iron age book with absurd stories and disgusting morals. They have doomed the future of their children by brainwashing them into believing the same stories they were brainswashed into. Like a virus, Islam has managed to spread and infect a generation after generation. And now it is spreading to Europe, which is very worrysome. It's disheartening that there are only three Muslim nobel prize winners in science. Moreover, the grave of the first one, Pakistani Prof. Dr. Abdus Salam, was vandalized, with the word ""Muslim"" scratched off his tombstone simply because he belonged to the Ahmadi sect, a smaller faction within Islam.
That is how much Muslims appreciate developement. Abdus Salam should be the pride of Muslims, but instead Muslims reject him because he happened to interpret the quran in a different way. As a Tunisian who was raised as a Muslim , I have been exposed to the true face of the said religion. Fortunately I grew up in the West and with an access to information, and thus managed to heal from the mind rot of Islam. Unfortunately not many of the new generation Muslims (especially in Western countries) are capable of doing the same, and the danger of societal isolation and Islamic pockets forming within society are real. Sweden is an excellent example of what happens when you don't take the danger of a iron age ideology seriously.
It really saddens me to see the misery of people who have been oppressed by Islam and its disgusting teachings. Iran for example can be considered as a failed nation, thanks to decades of oppression by their islamic government. Saudi-Arabia is dragging its feet when it comes to human rights, and so does Yemen, Libya, Oman, Jordan, Iraq, Pakistan etc. In Afganistan women are not allowed to even go to school thanks to the religious Talebans. Wherever Islam spreads, misery and sorrow follows.
And don't get me started with ""Western influence"". Westerners realized the dangers of following a medieval ideology and taking it literally, and thus they tamed it down and stopped following its teachings literally. That is why they went ahead while Muslims wallowed in their own Islamic regression. If Muslims had been smart enough to do the same, we might not have so many failed states in Middle-East filled with death and destruction.

Also to all Muslims reading this: Instead of taking this rant as an attack, think through it. Research and read more.","Didn’t read. Not a single word.

There are different examples for each argument, and there are plenty of counterarguments too, though I agree for the most part, in modern days, we don't need religion to obtain morality. It is the pther way around, religion often brings the worst side of humans.",not far from what you view this is how i see [religion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCe8NUK4BjQ),">significant poverty, intense tribal conflicts, unimaginable atrocities, human rights violations,

This is mostly happening because of either muslims or western countries.Islam doesn t have anything to do with this، it fobids racism، injustice and cruelty


>gender inequality

Men and women are different and yes islam doesn t treat them equally, it treats them justicely.


>conflicting with modern values

Who says that modern values are the best standard for morality. Modern values are changing and you can be wrong about a lot of things, why are liberals treating it like a divine ideology.

>of the prominent Islamic golden age scholars,

Do you have any proof to support this argument.

>Sweden is an excellent example of what happens when you don't take the danger of a iron age ideology seriously

You r talking about sweden the country that allows only the burning of the quran and kidnaps the childen of muslims.

>Afganistan women are not allowed to even go to school thanks to the religious Talebans

Again it s muslims not islam.

1ae1nm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1ae1nm1/hisalam_introducing_myself_to_the_community/,13,Hi!/Salam! Introducing myself to the community.,"Hi my fellow Tunisians! 

I have joined Reddit, and mostly to hang out in this sub. This time I would like to gain some wider connections with my roots, so I joined this sub. I see you guys mostly write in English, so I will do the same. Still weird, I thought every country mostly writes in their sub in their own language.

My parents are from Tunisia. Been there a few times. I know almost no french. Studied it, but always forget it. So speaking with Tunisians in french is a problem for me. I grew up with a little Arabic and even less Tunisian language, or whatever it is called nowadays. My parents went abroad very young, so their language is messed up. They picked up words from their youth in Tunisia, through Aljazeera and other Tunisians abroad. And now, since many years, I try to correct things and respect the tradition. But no one really appreciates it, even my own family.

I really like Tunisia, even though growing up in Scandinavia. We do not have that many North Africans here, mostly people from eastern Africa and Middle East.  I am somewhat of a history geek, which makes me even more interested in Tunisia from a historical perspective. So I bought the history book written by Habib Boularès, the red one. It was in Arabic, so it was hard to understand. And I realised that I needed to do something about it. But I have still a long way when it comes to Arabic.

The Tunisian language is easier. No real vocabulary. Everyone just use whatever works. One Tunisian woman I respect said that her generation from the 90s may be the last generation that speaks/understands real Tunisian language the same way the earlier generations did. She described the post-independence generations as truly francophone, to the degree that they speak french in their daily lives. Loosing the everyday use of the language of their direct ancestors. The respectable woman described her generation as the arabized one, growing up with cartoons in Arabic and with lots of education in Arabic. She even had the opportunity to take a university degree in either Arabic or French. In the end, she said, her generation has no real common language with the oldest in the society.

Trying to understand Tunisia, I started to watch lots of Tunisian TV. I realized it is mostly people sitting around tables. Talking about culture, or politics. These two seem to never intersect, and I think most of the world is like that. And trying to understand what is said I stumbled upon a realization. Tunisians talk creole. This is very interesting. But because it is not recognized, it is not officially seen as an independent language. And this is understandable. Arabic being the academic language over a thousand years, it reigns supreme.

Arabic is truly a beautiful language. Reading Arabic poetry and books is truly an amazing experience. There is also a ton of books from the middle ages that one can read. An example is A hundred and one nights compiled by Mahmoud Tarshouna for House of Wisdom. Luckily there are translations for the stories in it. This book is said to predate the stories in A thousand and one nights, although there are some similarities.

In this journey of identity and longing for something that may never be there, I have since the revolution been taking a closer look on Tunisia. At the beginning, I was full of desire to be Tunisian. With time, I found that there are some things that I have a hard time accepting in Tunisian society and mentality. But let us keep those things for another time. Still, I kept coming back to Tunisia mentally and physically. Reading and talking about Tunisia has become somewhat of a daily occurrence. My family is even telling me to stop being interested in Tunisia so much. An older Tunisian friend even asked me how it is possible for me to be so interested in Tunisia when he saw me watch Mosaique FM during a break. So now, it has become lonely. I am more knowledgeable than my parents and everyone else I know on Tunisia, and no one to talk to about this beautiful country. So, I hope you guys can welcome me and teach me more. As someone brought up abroad, with very few Tunisians around me, I hope you guys can guide me through contemporary Tunisia. 

I am sorry if I am too ""academic"" in my approach, but that is who I am and I hope that will not be off-putting.","There is a clear transition from a francophone society to a more open english speaking society with the younger generations. In the past 100 years at least, France has been the tunisians' gateway to western culture, our education system has been almost a complete mimic of the french one. Throw in some inferiority complex and the need to feel superior to less educated tunisians, and you got yourself a society full of french wannabes.

However today, France is less impressive to tunisians then what it used to be, so you can skip learning French imo. The tunisian dialect is less of a language and more of a dialect full of words from different origins and is very subject to change because it doesn't really have strict rules. You can't study it in books, you have to practice it. To this day I still occasionally hear words that I've never heard in my 20+ years living here.

Also arabic doesn't get enough credit, it's still afterall the official language of Tunisia and even the least educated tunisian will understand you if you speak it.",Welcome bro ! and thank you for the kind words ! How old are you if you don’t mind me asking ? You sound so mature and i totally respect your curiosity and passion about your roots !,"> I know almost no french. Studied it, but always forget it. So speaking with Tunisians in french is a problem for me 

 I studied French for 12 years but still can't speak it, haha. Don't worry about it. If you want to connect with Tunisians, just learn Tunisian, and the best way is to talk to other Tunisians. If you're really looking for a connection to Tunisia, visiting would be a great way to experience it firsthand. Anyway, you are most welcome to our community, and feel free to ask any questions.","I like your writing style. Excellent English skills there.

OP can you even define debt?",Usa debt is backed by USA nukes Tunisia debt is baked by our ضهوراتنا,"USA is in debt to ""its own"" banks they printed too much credit but don't have money circling around to pay for the credit. Mostly they are in debt to banks. Whenever it happens, they have to ""stop"" loans by increasing the interest and pay off the debt (people who took loans pay them).  
Sometimes it leads to an economic depression which is when the government intervenes and either decided a lot of people are going bankrupt and lose everything and become homeless or tell the rich to help the poor and middle class to pay their loans (usually makes the middle and poor classes hate the rich for having that much money). Sometimes both happen so they can pay their debt. Right now, there are a lot of people losing their jobs in the USA and companies are laying off 100,000's of people each month because of the recission (companies have to start paying their loans and debt before they also collapse).  


Point is capitalism is stupid and never works and this video is wrong to an extent. Although USA can print money to pay the debt that will only cause more issues and the value of the dollar will drop drastically which is why they never done it before. They always resort to fucking people over first. ""They"" as in the US government and companies because they actually are working in debt and with loans most of the time.",2024-01-29 11:11:24

Imagine how would it be without that.

The real question, why the fuck are they still ""firing"" students when we know that this type of kids consider that a reward since ~1980s.

I'm in a bit of a dilemma and could really use some advice. Last year, I managed to earn my BTS Certificate (Brevet de technicien supérieur), which was a big deal for me considering my past. I've been working as a cloud engineer for a company based in Malta, doing remote work and making decent money. But here's the thing: I never got the chance to pursue further studies due to some rough patches in my late teens that left me homeless. Now, I'm really itching to continue my education.

I've been looking into the possibility of studying abroad for a bachelor's degree, and maybe even becoming an engineer in the future. The problem is, that most private schools in Tunisia, where I'm from, typically require a baccalauréat or an equivalent level of education, which I unfortunately don't have.

So, I'm wondering if there's any hope for someone with a BTS certificate like mine to further their studies abroad. Any advice, ideas, or even personal experiences would be hugely appreciated.   


Thanks a bunch in advance!",,,,,,2024-01-30 16:04:48

1. You can only invest fil boursa through an intermediate broker (intermediaire en bourse exp: Attijari Intermediation). What you do is give them the budget you want to invest, and they either will recommend to or discuss with you where you want to allocate that money. Of course, they will cut off a portion of the reveneue, if any*, for their profit.

2. The stock market is plus ou moins stable (lobbying you know, presque famech concurrence, or kol chay wkhayn fi baadhhom), but still you can invest and make revenue. For that you need to invest a good amount (min 10k) and keep up with your brokers. You need to supervise your stocks even knowing brokers already managing the work for you. It really needs time and effort to analyze the market, for you to be included in the investment process and decision making.

So my advice, I don't think it is a good option to invest your money in stocks. It is risky and requires efforts, and an analysis and understanding of stocks market. Still though, looking for a steady business model that suits Tunisian economy (coffeeshop, 7amas).","No, the stock market is a joke with around 80 listed companies.
The performance is terrible.
The intermediaries are clueless with predatory fees.
The economic indicators are bad.
The start ups can not be listed, so there's no chance for your investment to boom.","If you don’t have trading experience I strongly discourage you of trading by yourself or relying on internet forums ( ilBoursa forum included). **All what you can read is manipulation.**

If you want to trade by yourself take courses, read books, and trade on papermoney accounts before trading any real dinar.

I can tell you though that it’s interesting to take advantage of tax incentivized accounts (CEA accounts for example), and let your broker manage your account if you have no experience.

For the Tunisian Market itself, it’s very boring… We still have a dividend related culture so no real Capital Gains but steady income from divi if you can manage to grow your portfolio value. The daily volume is also very low.

He doesn’t tell me u did turn left in the wrong way u should do this instead, he just keeps bullying me how I did turn wrong without explaining why or how I can fix it.

He would charge more than necessary, scream and most importantly he would taya7 lkadr and stubborn asf. For exemple, he spent 2 weeks asking me to stick on the right, sometimes even in situations when it was impossible. Then, when I started sticking on.the right, he criticized me for it, and when I told him that I applied what he wanted, he raised even more his voice. I told him ""mouch khatrek itaya3t rak shih"", he litterally exploded, telling me that he won't take me.anymore and that I will only fo seances with his partner.

If one partner (regardless of gender) doesn’t have a revenue or significatively less, he shouldn’t be paying. Assuming the one with revenues obviously knew since the beginning that the other isn’t in a situation of inviting, if he isn’t comfortable with this, he shouldn’t have engaged in this relationship.","Married here. We share our income and pay together for expenses like rent, bills, nursery, holidays etc. One person pays rent and bills. Another nursery and savings. We have mutual shared saving account where we send part of our shared income to. Groceries, going out we just pay randomly. Once I’m paying, once she is paying. But no one is really keeping a track of who is paying more. The part that’s left from our salaries we use for whatever we want. If by the end of the month one of us ran out of money, the other person just top ups the account. That’s not happening often. I think we have very healthy way of dealing with money. We basically almost totally share income (minus some money for ourselves) and don’t keep much track of who spent more.

I’m not Tunisian and before I used to share 50/50 with my girlfriends. Maybe not on first dates, but after whoever was inviting was paying.

Depression is a disease like any other and it's normal to see a doctor,"This post just randomly appeared on my feed (I have no connection to Tunisia whatsoever) but I will tell you something from personal experience in hopes that it will be of some help:

I've dealt with OCD and suicidal thoughts before and know how horrific it can be. There were moments when I thought I'm doomed to live like that for the rest of my life; it felt like being stuck in a black void and screaming into it, with no one else around to truly hear or understand. I simply couldn't see how life could ever improve.

After going through one such episode, I sat and wrote my thoughts down, trying to get to the root of what exactly was causing the anguish, and realized that for me personally it was a sense of immense self-loathing. I couldn't forgive others for some terrible things that they did to me in the past, and I couldn't forgive myself for being weak and not being able to push back at the time, for allowing myself to be hurt. I thought, ""Surely, God must be punishing me for this and that, why else would I need to go through all this pain? All of this happened for a reason, I must be completely worthless, maybe I deserve to die.""

You may have been weak at some point in the past, you may have made mistakes or wronged someone, but none of that means the rest of your life is doomed and you deserve to die. The very fact that you are alive is a testament to the fact that you can fix and change things.

When intrusive thoughts arise, don't panic and try to fight them; fighting will exhaust you, and the demons will just grow stronger. Instead, allow them to pass through you. Stay indifferent. To every thought that arises, just say: ""so what? Yes, I am this and that, so what? Does that make me less of a human?"" 

By letting the thoughts pass through, I do not mean believe everything that these demons whisper to you; rather, just let them ramble on. Once they see that you aren't fighting and are, in fact, indifferent to everything they say, they'll slowly start to dissipate. They'll realize they have no power over you.

Praying, doing dhikr (preferably in a group), listening to the Quranic recitations also helps tremendously. I'd also recommend looking into some basic meditation and breathing techniques. On a purely physical level — try to eat well, cut out junk food, exercise (it raises serotonin levels), see a doctor and do some blood tests, speak to a psychologist. And feel free to message me if you want to talk.","I have been there.... hell I'm still there. It's painful. We all have our demons. Why not try a therapist? If it's not achievable, call a friend. I'm willing to talk if you ever want to.",I hope you find peace with urself,"I had my moments of struggle as well (tho it's not a big deal, just fake pride complex).  
Idk if this can help you but find something you want to do before you die, something you would still want to live for.  
For example, reading the entire Qur'an (I haven't read it all yet), or something you put your creativity into, such as writing a novel; in my case it's game development (I'm developing a game and I want to see it come to life).  
I don't know what you've been through my friend, in fact I want t go back 5 years ago and be in middle school again to be a better version of myself, but tbh I realized that if I start over then I am not starting from zero and even so I've learned from my mistakes and I'm faster now.    
Again, try to write a novel or do something through which you tell a story, like a game in my case. Creativity and art are important things in life.

I am the one who decides if you are from Tunis or not.,"OK let us be clear about some things, if your grandfather moved in mid to late 1800s to Tunis and within a few years bought a house in Beb Souika then I can can approve you as a Tunisois (a person from Tunis) but only if you meet other requirements. I mean, if you for example meet all the requirements but you're stupid then unfortunately you can't be a tunisois. 

Being from Tunis is a concept, an idea, a feeling. You have to be aware of it. You have to understand the culture. You have to be aware of what El Hezb was. You have to be capable of imagining how life was in the 1970s even if you were not born then. Under the Bourguiba rule. If you meet all these requirements then yeah sure maybe you're a Tunisois.

1afmwms,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1afmwms/most_tunisian_people_dont_even_believe_in_mental/,19,Most Tunisian people don't even believe in mental health,"it's a sad and frustrating fact that i came to  realize lately about us... In more developed societies, mental health takes priority in the hierarchy of human well-being. These nations demonstrate a heightened awareness of factors negatively impacting mental health, swiftly and efficiently addressing them. 

Tunisia faces a staggering rate of suicides, with studies revealing that in 2020 alone, over 380 Tunisians took their own lives. So contrary to common belief, suicide is NOT a foreign concept. Not to mention the countless youngsters who lived their whole lives heavily medicated, often resulting in tragic overdoses and fatalities. 

Nowadays, thanks to social media, males are more isolated than ever, making it challenging and even embarrassing for them to express their true emotions. Simultaneously, females grapple with an obsession with fake beauty standards and harmful foreign trends, made to disrupt and destroy our social fabric.

The crux of the issue lies not in the aforementioned facts, but rather in our failure to acknowledge the severity of our collective mental health crisis.

 ",We are Tunisiens we bottle up our emotions and die from a cardiac arrest in our 40 💪,"

Tunisian mental health 101

(Gets sad & depressed):

*la matebkich!*

(Being vulnerable):

*chbik hakka? e9bes ro7ek!*","Unfortunately it's not something from old generations only, it's even in the new generations including engineers and doctors themselves.

""I think I have anxiety"" - dont be, stop thinking about things.

""I think I have depression"" - it's because you always dont go out with us

""I think I have a trauma from X thing"" - Pfft people went through the same and turned out better than you.

And many other things that people shared. Tunisians can't understand that there could be hormonal/chemical imbalances in the body that could cause mental issues just like they could cause issues in other organs. There's a raise in young age deaths lately compared to some years ago and most of them are caused by cardiac arrests and strokes.","Sorry for stopping at the semantics of the subject, but ""believing in mental health"" doesn't mean anything. It's like saying you don't believe in ears or you don't believe in hands. Now this analogy can be useful to the development further down. If you get an ear infection, you can express your emotions all day long, it will not fix the infection. The good thing to do is to go to a specialist that will give you meds. 
Well guess what, mental health is the same. We have the conviction that the cure to mental health is ""expressing emotion"" across all the spectrum of mental health issues, which can help in certain cases, but it can be a disaster if done with the wrong people, that might give you crappy advice. The solution is to go to a specialist and get meds if necessary.

""Expressing emotions"" should not be done undescriminately in front of anyone. For one, it's an aweful habit to have, and it quickly becomes addictive because it gives you the false sense that any consequence to that emotion is excusable, second it is kindda addictive cuz it spares you the effort of sucking it up and doing what you should do, which is get your shit together one way or another, and third, you should only express your emotions in front of people you trust, cuz nobody gives a shit about your emotions.

Now am not denying that sometimes things can be crushing and it is very hard to get back up, and that a lot of times families do not understand. That is totally correct. But what is totally wrong though, is that the whole ""express your emotions"" & ""be who you want to be"" in the more advanced societies is far from solving the suicide issues, on the contrary, the rates are sky rocketing. People became self centered (thus the importance of subjective experience and therefore the overvaluation of emotions), which isolates individuals even more and accentuates their troubles. Add a sprinkle of identity crisis and you will have the perfect ""Human flesh cake"" on the foot of a 3imara.","صحيح في تونس موش مركزين مع موضوع الصحة النفسية الي هي مهمة برشا من انسان تعدى بصدمات و بورن اوت و يجاهد في روحو باش يطور اما راهو البرة زادة الوضع موش باهي رغم الامكانيات

Speaking socially, the different identities built on the centralized states’ unnatural borders are non-factual: the people in southeast Tunisia (Zarzis, Tataouine, medenine..) for a example have a lot more in common in terms of traditions or dialect or landscape with the rest of theTripolitanian region (northwest libya) than they do with the rest of Tunisia the same goes for the southwest in relation with the adjacent Algerian region of Toughourt (el wed, biskra..) or the northwest with the Algerian east (Tebessa, Elgalla, Annaba..) and this patern can be observed all over the region (the Maghrebi dialect continuum). Almost all studies have proven that the Maghrebi non-unification has already costed billions of dollars of lost potential economic grown, the region has since the fall of the almohads had no major role in history only being dominated and colonized by super powers which made sure to induce as many conflicts in the region as they could so no unified block could stand in the way (Western Sahara, Morrocan-Algerian border conflicts..). If the region is to remain divided, we will have no role in history, all facts point that way. these divided states in the grand scale of history will be insignificant, never properly prosper, never have a sovereign foreign policy and never compete in a space race (bear with me).
History has proven that every nation wishing to prosper has to expand and i see no future for the region unless a federal state like that of the US or Germany is formed.

Appreciate your help in advance!","FB groups (Tunisian) post regularly for adoptable kittens (or cats). The Cat distribution system is overactive in Tunisia as well on account of all the strays, so.. 

What I don't recommend (and what usually people try out), is getting a kitten (usually designer breed like a Siamese or a Persian) from a breeder shop. I don't recommend this because (let's disregard the principle for a bit), store kittens are separated from their moms prematurely, and that compromises their immunity and even affects their psyche. My store bought eldest is such an anxious boy. Probably because the store owner would leave him in the dark every night after closing. He's loving and cuddly of course, but he's very very skittish, and for a month after we got him he had ringworm (and the vendor lied about his age).",أخرج للشارع تو تلقا، و اخطاك مالشريان. عاون قطوس في الشارع تربح فيه ثواب,"Kittens are all over the streets everywhere you go in tunis, so try to find a one capture it feed it take it to the vet for vaccin.

And to prepare myself where can we go for abortion. I dont want to get Police involved.",There's no reason why the police would get involved !,"To prevent pregnancy: condoms or birth control
In case of pregnancy: go to you gynecologist, they will explain to you what you can do next","Dont be supper worried or your period will be delayed just because of the stress! My advice is, if your period is late more than 1 week (if your cycle is organized/fixed), buy a pregnancy test and see. 
Dont worry about buying it, the people who sell meds don’t really care about you buying a pregnancy test, if you feel uncomfortable you can wear a ring when you go to the pharmacy. Another option would be to ask a friend to buy it for you/ask your Fiance. 

Case 1: you took the test and it’s negative. Congrats! 
Case 2: you took the test and it’s positive. You have a few options: 
Take a blood test to be sure that you’re pregnant 
Go to a gynecologist and they will guide you, prescribe meds if needed or send you to a lab to get blood tests 

Stuff that are worth mentioning: 
- time is super important, when/if your period is late go to a doctor or buy the test as soon as possible. 
- if you have enough money, the gynecologist will inform you about how an abortion will be done, where (a clinique) and how much money it will cost. 
- if money is tight, you can go to “tanthim al 3aili” the abortion is basically free but BUT be prepared to feel uncomfortable because sadly most people who work there are rude and judgmental (i went more than once and really hated everything about that place). 
- if you do it at a clinic or at “tanthim el 3a2li” you’ll be able to go home on the same day. 
- pain is something to be expected for the first few days so it would be best if you rest after it at least for 2 days or so.

Don’t waste time, act fast so even if you’re pregnant you’ll be able to prevent a bigger problem. 

Good luck","She needs to check herself always, at a certain age of the baby the abortion becomes illegal.
She needs to kn if she’s pregnant a soon as she can.
If she is a bit smart she needs to check her cycle, avoid sex in the ovulation period(check the internet I can’t make SVT class here), use some contraceptives.","Tu n’as pas la pillule du lendemain, aussi tu es sure que tu es enceinte?",2024-02-01 20:28:58

In the current state of affairs, our economy depends heavily on foreign currencies to function.

Foreign products are bought with foreign currencies. If we consume more foreign products, we use more foreign currency. If we consume local products as substitutes to foreign ones (Sablito vs Biskrem for example) we consume less foreign products and use up less foreign currency.

This also has to do with economic growth. A foreign company that has a subsidiary in Tunisia and sells products in the Tunisian market, brings in raw material, that it uses to manufacture a product. That product is then sold for a profit. At the end of the year, the Tunisian subsidiary sends its profits to its mother company abroad. Those profits will most likely be invested elsewhere and will create value elsewhere.

Now if this were a Tunisian company, the profits would remain in Tunisia, and thus the revenue from any future investment will always come back to the Tunisian economy, contributing to our economic growth.

TLDR; we save on foreign currency to use it on more essential stuff, and the profits remaining inside the Tunisian economy unlocks the potential for more growth and investment.","You average imported product consists of these things:  

the foreign materials used to make the product 

the foreign energy used to make it  

the foreign labor  

When you buy foreign products we pay in dollars for all these 3.  

Whereas local products consist of  

-local materials or foreign materials  

-local energy or foreign energy  

- local labor  

When you buy local products what’s sure you are paying in dinars the local labor and saving dollars. Now depending if we are energy independent and we have the materials needed to make the product we may save more dollars. ( This is called integration rate). Pretty much no products has a 100% integration rate we will still import few things to make the product but what matters is we ended up spending less foreign currency and saving it for more important things.  

Another thing, when the labor of your products is local you are creating jobs for your people and decreasing unemployment. When you import products with foreign labor it’s like you are importing unemployment to your people.  

A thing to keep in mind, you consuming local products on your own won’t change anything. The state must opt and apply protectionism and cut importing products in sectors it sees Tunisia has an advantage making locally at a lower cost. ","mostly because buying local products supports the Tunisian economy by creating jobs, meeting domestic demand, boosting exports, and attracting foreign investment.

this also helps the agriculture sector which as you know is of very high importance to our economy

in simpler terms, when you buy local products you are keeping the dinar at home, when you buy imported products you give your dinar to other countries and when we export our products other countries send us their currency, which in the long run could fix the devaluation of the TND

and we are lacking behind when it comes to consuming tunisian products, i live in france and they put Fabriqué en France whenever they can, with a blue white and red map of France, Same thing is going on in the usa","Buying local products = Putting money in the pockets of corrupt people who never pay taxes  and who keep their money ABROAD (We're talking billions of dollars here)

Supporting local products is a good idea IN THEORY only, not in a lawless shithole like Tunisia. Just buy whatever you think is good and can afford. Empty patriotism is a cheap drug for morons and poor people",If they pay taxes yes,2024-02-01 10:24:41

Second, get to know the subjects that you're studying and why are you studying them, for example, algorithm is basically problem solving through a limited set of tools (the problem being the project you're working on, the limited set of tools being the programming language you're working with), you need to realize that these subjects are actually skills that you will be using daily and are not just subjects that you need to study to pass your exams (some of them are ngl).
Third, you have a certain degree of freedom, which is tailoring your projects to your needs, you can make them fun your own way, for example, if i was assigned to make a random something generator, i would probably be generating memes or curse words or anything i think would be funny, stuff like that will get you to dive deeper and give you the push you need to do your research.
By the time you get these steps down, you'll figure out the rest on your own, as for your parents, it's probably okay if you told them since this is your own future and you're just trying your best to figure it out on your own.

I left Canada to the US because your net salary even as an engineer or highly paid white collar employee is no longer enough to live comfortably.

For those who have nothing in Tunisia. No owned house and capital, leaving is still the best option because starting up without those two is almost impossible anywhere in Tunisia.  

The solution imo, is to work hard and literally deprive yourself from living by working multiple jobs to save as much as you can and invest it in Tunisia to start up and succeed (thats already what Tunisians in the persian gulf do). Maybe start olive farm or if you made good network in your country of residence you can start exporting goods/ services. Besides the economic reasons that life in the west isn’t as green as what people think, the west double standards, discrimination and values and other social factors are also as important in making one consider continuing to live there for a long time.

all of this was in a month and a half, I kicked him out after that and been living alone ever since.","I had a nasty roommate that didn't know how to flash the toilet after peeing, and I caught her twice using my tooth brush, she clogged the kitchen sink so many times because she'd make rice and throw the leftovers in the sink, she was raised with wolves, in the end we kicked her out, the amount of trash and 3fan we found in her room, was unbelievable, although you'll never see her without her hair done and without make up she always smelled nice and wore nice clothes, ye mzayen min barra lol","After a couple of days of asking him to take the plastic bottles he kept throwing randomly on the kitchen floor and him neglecting that and saying he forgot, I waited for him to be about to leave and gave him his bag of trash in his hand in a ""whats your excuse now?"" manner.

He tried to convince me that he's leaving for university rn and that it's not the right time ( dumpster bin was just downstairs ) and we had an exchange which kind of started to escalate in him telling me that he'll fuck me up and bring me a truck full of people from his home town to beat me up. He tried to throw the trashbag in the corridor and run but I was faster than him to shove him outside of the flat with the trash bag in his hands )

He kept knocking on the door and spouting aggressive shit at me which soon turned into ""Ok just open the door I forgot my notebook and I need to take it for class"" I didn't listen to any of what he said and kept blocking the door for 10mins or so until he chose to leave.

Needless to say the living conditions didn't get any better after that incident and I ended up trying my best to avoid being at home for the rest of the lease.

There was one time where he forgot to turn off the gas ( we all knew there was a gas leak and that you have to turn it off after showering ) pipe and left ( I was the only one at home, sleeping ) but the funniest incident of all is when he forgot the fork in the microwave and forced us onto the very creative looking mloukhiya-walled-kitchen (which he didn't think it was necessary to clean ofc )",Dirty? 😏,I changed flat.

Not particularly. Some people simply don't like people from other regions in side Tunisia, so it wouldn't surprise me if they see such marriages negatively.

It is a big store that is similar to big supermarkets but instead of food it sells hardware stuff; screwdrivers, painting materials, gardening stuff, building materials, car repairing stuff and anything in those categories (look at the picture in the first comment)

1- theft: it is perhaps easier to steal a screw driver than 5 kilo smid and that's why most investors are afraid to invest in such a thing.

2- Tunisia is not  a developed country and things like these will eventually come just like the way we're smoothly moving from traditional drug stores (3attara) to bigger supermarkets. It is just a matter of time.

3- Tunisian men are not handy and they prefer either sitting in cafés smoking their lives away or in the best of cases working with typical post modernist feminine clerk jobs where paper and pen (i.e computers in 2024) are the main tools. 

Discuss.","Belhasen trabelssi says hi.
Bricorama says hi",Other reason may be: lack of DIY culture,"Hello, American here living in Tunisia for more than a year. I have been a “handy man” all my adult life and I sometimes struggle here in Tunisia to find what I need at the quincaillerie to make repairs and do maintenance around the house. I would love it if there was a giant quincaillerie in Tunisia similar to “Home Depot” stores in America. So this question you ask is very interesting to me. Here is my assessment:

While there may be some truth in each the options you suggest, none of these 3 things seem to hit the answer perfectly. 

It’s actually secret option number 4.
The cost of skilled labor here in Tunisia is insanely low. Having experience and training in a “blue collar” trade skill (i.e. Plumber, Carpenter, Electrician, Car Mechanic) should have a higher salary than it does here. 
On many occasions I have just given up on doing the work myself. If my toilet breaks, the cost for me to go to the hardware store (quincaillerie) and buy all the stuff/tools is higher than the labor costs to pay the Plumber.
In comparison to my home country, a big reason why America has a “quincaillerie culture” as you suggest is because the cost to pay a skilled worker is too much for simple jobs around the house. You MUST learn to do it yourself or you will go bankrupt to keep maintenance around the house. 

My humble opinion 😁","Because you usually get all the shit you need at M'hirsi or any other quincaillerie.

If you need specialized stuff you just go to specialized shops and it's sorted.

Plus Tunisians aren't really into DIY or fixing their own shit. It's still very cheap to get something fixed by someone to warrant fixing it yourself.",10000 articles fi soukra mathalan,2024-02-03 16:48:21

Why would you not marry / not open to marry a person from another region or place , what are your reasons?","As many generations of such folks only married in a more or less limited genetical pool, their descendents today harbour a collection of neurological and psychatric defects, which made them .. retarded. 🙃

Yes they are retarded to still have superiority beliefs and segratory practices in a country that spans 1000 x 200 km, with no ethnic or religious communities.

Ti zaab we're all bastards of a zllion conquerors who passed through this land.. no body knows his exact genealogy past 3 or 5 generations maximum, and we still say hedha baldi, hedha sfaxi, hedha 08, hedha gabsi..","As a Tunisian born in Europe, I guess my parents would be happy if I at least marry a Tunisan girl, regardless the region xD

That being said,  I get coming from the same area may be easier. For ex, my familly is from Binzart, my sister married a guy whose family is from Mahdia. When that's about going to Tunisia in summer, things are quite complicated as they are forced to do 50/50 in each region and cut their hollydays in 2 in order to make their kids enjoy their both families. Things are less complicated when your both families are 20min appart in the same city.",![gif](giphy|gSRkSblDEjUuk),جهل. As simple as that,"am going to play the devil's advocate here and do a ""next step"" thinking approche (meaning every point is a consequence or a result of the one before):

* if your partner don't have a strong and independent personality, then you are just naïve to ""ignore"" their family.

* if the family has tradition/ideology that deeply conflict with yours, and your not-so independent partner insist on following them, then you must re-consider or just accept the sacrifice you will be forced to do.

* same thing applies to you and your family, you may actually be the ""asshole tribe""

**Concrete example of ridiculous regional shit i saw among marriages of friends/family** :

* husband's family spend ~2 weeks in the couple's house during the first ""3id l'kbir"" to make sure the bride is up to the task (she was extremely annoyed and couldn't do shit)

* bride's family made the girl force her husband to bring ""fest-like"" raw food before even getting engaged.

* husband's family insisting in pre-marriage 7ammem to confirm she is ""up to standard""

* bride's family insisting the husband spends a ~week in their region because they think he is from a ""pussy city""


etc...

every example is a different wedding.

every example , as ridiculous as it is, it's 90% based on the habit and traditions of the family, which comes from the habits and traditions of the region.

but what often only get talked about is :

* Sfax has a god-complex

*  benzart, mahdeya, mestir, sousse think they are Targarians and need to stay pure

* baldeya (everywhere) refuse to marry their brown sons to non super white chicks.

but no one talks about

* South-west : we are the only real men in the country and all the beach-citirs are pussies and used to be French-traitors

* north-west: our ladies are so ""pure"" and ""polite"" unlike the bitches you have in the sea-side part.


long story short:

this is a more complex subject and at the end if 2 people truly want to get married (not one partner just want to get laid and the other want to ""secure"" her future) then they will just do it.

this is a problem as old as marriage itself, and it will never go away.",2024-02-03 16:10:41

I mean as the title says, it's so mind boggling, you can literally make Facebook page or start a tiktok channel and start sharing the most stupid nonsense you can think of and you'll see how too many people will actually believe anything you say.

I'll give some examples just for people to understand what kind of stupidity we are dealing with and how easy it is to manipulate tunisians into believing any kind of fake news or propaganda, The examples go far back.

- last year with The B13 nonsense of this so called hacker who hacked the iron dome and made the IDF tremble, people were sharing it day and night and celebrating while the fact of the matter no such thing ever happened. It was all pure BS and people are still believing it to this day. 

- A new wave of pseudo-intellectuals who are spreading some absolute nonsense about history and archeology while none of them are actual historians or archeologists, these absolute morons are spreading false narratives that basically all the ruines we are seeing today in tunisia are all carthaginian, the romans haven't built a thing, from el jem, to al hnaya to basically every peace of rock you see today was built by the carthaginians and the so called romans just faked everything 😑 like seriously. 

-  Recently the other fake lie that everyone is spreading, that unesco has now came out and said that the capsians are the oldest civilization in human history, while there's no such thing and the capsians were a culture not a civilization, and people are so stupid and stubborn it's beyond belief. If you ask these morons to give you a source or a link to this unesco article they will all reply with the same thing ""search for it yourself"" 🤦‍♂️

- Now this one is a really funny one, it's not being spread as the other ones but i'm seeing it all over the place. There's a wave of new morons who are actually growing in numbers and they're basically saying that tunisia is the actual holy land not palestine and that all the judaic prophets from the solomon and so on were actually here in tunis and the covenant is in tunis, i know it's really stupid but there are people who are actually believing it. Like wtf is going on with this country. 


Why is it, that a great number of tunisians lack the ability to do some actual critical thinking, why they'd rather believe morons with no academic background than Actual intellectuals with degrees and all.

It's really frustrating especially when you're trying to correct people and they all attack you, call you the worst of names and call you a traitor 😂 like seriously.

Ps: i'm sharing it to see what you all think about all of this.","The problem is the media, they take rumors as facts and spread them. A few years ago, someone claimed that Sadio Mane is marrying a Tunisian, and it spread rapidly,the poor fella had to deny it. They also never check sources, like when they believed the claim of a fat guy who said he swam from Italy to Tunisia. And ofc their favorite hobby  exaggerating, such as when a robot team won a small prize, they promoted it as a 'historic AI achievement.'","Has nothing to do with Tunisia (or Tunisians). You find stories like this everywhere: Ukraine with the Ghost of Kiev; USA with... ughh... tons of things? (see how many still support Trump); and even Germany with proven lies told by AFD (400 million cycle path to Peru story, etc.).  


Your average citizen is stupid. Has nothing to do with nationality.","It's a combination of three things:

- Give the Police a makeover to cut down on corruption and highlight the idea that they work for us, not the other way around.

- Most importantly, ditch the IMF deals – they're bleeding the state pocket (around 200 billion/ month). We can argue the past debt mess was cooked up by an undemocratically elected government.

no the situation is TOTALLY unacceptable.. this is our country we are ملاكة here. In fact the retrograde currents want us to give up and leave them the country to ruin it (unintentionally as they think they are serving their country but are actually driving it back because of their incompetence)

>This is our country

💯

There is a lot to be done..

I think the main cause of all crisis in Tunisia (political and social) is the economic situation. If the economy starts to get better everything will improve.

Our main economic problem is **stagnation**. (many countries are way more corrupt and indebted than us but their economic growth makes it bearable for the citizens.. modern economies pay their debts with economic growth and we should do too)

Economic growth is an emergency for us. The current regime has proved its failure to achieve it. (Economic growth is **-0.2%** and Unemployment is 15.8% *source: ins.tn*)

The current president and his government unfortunately failed to improve the economh.. they made it even worse (the economy is actually shrinking!).

Now if you have a failing team, you have to replace it with a bette team.. and that is what we should do. We have to vote a better president in the next elections: People voted Ennahda.. the latter failed.. now they voted KS.. he failed and therefore must be replaced by a better one.

We should sensibilize our citizens and make them vote wisely (based on logic and efficiency) next time and not vote بعقلية الفيراج. There is no other way.. we need a vision with a program based on realistic and efficient policies backed by stats, studies and logic","We absolutely can, under one simple condition:

""We may not live up to see the change we expect, but our children and grandchildren will surely do.""

What has been wrecked and corrupted over generations won't be fixed overnight.

We should question ourselves, focus on improving the mindset from each individual's perspective, and encourage those susceptible to change, persuade those who resist.

The problem is Unity, not in idealogies or thoughts, but rather unity towards an objective: Let this nation rise for once.",2024-02-05 10:59:10

Even though me and an American go through the same immigration process and their documents literally say immigrants, they prefer to call themselves expats.
I think they feel offended or some shit as if immigrants can only fit brown people.","Immigrate is the default, expatriate is the specificity...

The moment you intent to become a permanent resident or a citizen of your country of immigration, you can no longer pretend being an expat (as your new home is your new country).

If you're just passing by, with no intent of settling / going through the citizenship route, up to you to call yourself whatever you want.

From one side they allow premarital consensual sex and from other side they treat the women in dorms like they are in a nuns chapel. Consenting adults should be able to have whoever they wish into their bedrooms.,"&#x200B;

This issue is particularly important because public dorms are the ONLY way for many girls to access higher education. 

By tarnishing the reputation of such public establishments, many low-income families will stop allowing their daughters to attend universities. 

That's why the government rightly has zero tolerance for this kind of behavior. 

According to reports, the police pursued them until they were caught.

the second type of Fear, is one brought on by none other than Azrael, chief commander of instinctive flight or flight battaleons, that are engaged in full force when it is quite clear that not only is the battle lost and out of hand, and one which one sees its pointless (thus there was no battle at all)  but also when one MUST wake up tomorrow. (all conditions must be met)

1ak9182,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1ak9182/mohamed_bouazizi_question/,8,Mohamed Bouazizi question,"Hello! I travelled some time ago to Tunisia and managed to spend quite the time there and see most of the country.
I enjoyed the culture, the cuisine, the environment and etc. Lovely people and I look forward to visit the country again/ 
I have a question for Tunisians regarding the Arab Spring. When I was in Sidi Bouaziz I encountered a lot of people that frowned upon the name Mohamed Bouazizi. I was told that many Tunisians hate that city he came from, because it “became worse after that”. But if you read on the western owned media it is clearly referred to him as a “Hero”. Also I notice lots of differences in the story that led to him burning himself. In the media it is said he was harassed by a female police officer because of his stand and lack of license. In Tunisia I was told that he was drinking, lying with his weights at the stand and that he tried to r*pe the government worker due to which his stand was confiscated. So…my question is where is the truth? Is this really a horrible case that lead to the uprising or the West used and abused the situation to take down the government? Or something in between?","Drunk yes, attempted rape no, he was harassed by a female officer that allegedly physically assaulted him, which led to him feeling humiliated.

The drunk thing came later when he was attempting to request his stand back and burned himself alive.

I would assume it's easier to go through with suicide if you're drunk.

Anyway, he ain't considered a hero here just a cause for something, you can say a small trigger to let the other shit overflow.

Reasons differ for why a lot of ppl don't like him, some ppl just are fans of the stability dictatorship brought, some ppl don't think he was on the right since he did have a none licensed stall, some ppl simply dislike the fact that his family received reparations for an act he willingly did that isn't really the cause of the revolution just a trigger etc etc.

Anyway western media over glorifies a surface level trigger while ignoring so many factors including other ppl that sacrificed same shit if not more than bouazizi.

At the end of the day it was a matter of timing, he happened to be the facade of it nothing really special, Tunisian ppl would rather glorify ppl that spent years in jail being tortured for freedom of speech related charges.

Just to put into prespective how the bouazizi situation is a matter of timing, in Tunisia from 2010 to 2022 there has been around 3000 attempted in public suicides in the same method I forgot the number of how many of them were successful but it's a decent number.","The full story with all the background:

Unrest was on the rise during that period, in 2008 there were riots in the mines bassin region because of high rates of unemployment and injustice toward the locals during hiring processes. The region is rich with minerals and fossile energy, but the locals are not benefiting from anything, low quality of life, high unemployment rates, plus all the pollution and diseases coming from those mines and oil plants. Riots were repressed, and the government bought peace with some small measures

Fast forward to 2011, Bouazizi was a street vendor and known to the police, he was not an angel. In Tunisia, street vendors are common, and the government doesn't repress them much, because originally they come from poor families, and can't find jobs, so to buy their silence, the government doesn't bother them as long as they are doing their business calmly. Bouazizi was one day getting controlled by the police, he was fined and his weights were being confiscated and the officer who was acting the confiscation was a woman, He allegedly protested and asked ""what am I going to use to weigh? Am I going to use ""these""?"" and allegedly he reached to the officer's breasts and groped her (not rape), in reaction she hit him on the face.

Later that day, people say he was drunk and threatened to burn himself in protest, he already had spilled gas on himself and went in front of the delegation (administrative building like the sheriff's office), apparently that was not the first time he threatened to do that. May be because he was drunk, he acted on his threats, and burnt himself, some say it was an accident and he didn't mean to do that. Mind you, he was not the first Tunisian to burn himself in protest, some guy burnt himself few months before, in another region, but it did not have the same impact.

People started protesting after this, and the police brutally repressed those protests, but it rapidly spread to the rest of the region, and the police started ahooting protesters. This was not the first time the police brutally repressed protests, but this time it was very violent and people filmed that violence and uploaded it to Facebook, and now all Tunisians, young and old saw what was happening.

I have to open a small parenthesis here, as I said, it was not the first time the Tunisian police repressed protests, but most people were kept in the dark, and we didn't hear about it unless we saw it in on foreign news outlets, like Aljazeera, not every one watches Aljazeera, and people tend to avoid talking about such news in fear of getting caught. But with Facebook, and lack of awareness that the government can track them down, people probably felt less afraid, and shared the videos and the news of the protests and the repression that was happening in Sidi Bouzid and Gasserine.

Bouazizi died few days after the incident because of his injuries and when the news came out, the protests grew in numbers. Gradually, it spread to the rest of the country, Ben Ali tried to be firm and used menacing words in his speeches during the first weeks, but it only made people angrier. When protests reached main cities, like Sfax, Sousse and especially Tunis, the government tried propaganda and threats, but nothing worked, Ben Ali decided to be more lenient, and in his last speech admitted that mistakes were made, and promised he will make amends.

On the day he fled, a big gathering happened in front of the interior ministry, the fortress of the oppressive system of Ben Ali, inside the ministry were some political opposition figures and militants who were arrested, being questioned and even tortured. Security intelligence were informed that thousands of protesters are planning to storm the presidential palace and that was not good at all because it meant a lot of deaths and probably endangering the country's security. His security advisors rushed him to leave the country, he agreed to take his family to a safe place (Saudi Arabia) and come back immediately, but when he arrived there, the pilot was asked to come back without Ben Ali and his family. It was decided that his time as a president came to an end.

During the following years, the country suffered several crises, political and economical, plus the rise of terrorism. The governments that came after Ben Ali, all of them tried to buy peace by distributing money, by increasing salaries, hiring a lot of people... but during that time, businesses were fleeing the country, or just closing doors.

The political quarrels inflamed the rage inside the people, from their point of view, politicians were fighting to gain control over the country's resources and were getting richer, and they are not solving any problems, and with all the scandals and rumors that break every now and then, plus insecurity on the rise, and prices getting higher by the day, some Tunisians started regretting Ben Ali and his era, ""at least we were safe, and not starving"" some said (not that famine was happening in the country). Also the real story of Bouazizi was coming out, before that he was considered more like a martyr, not a hero, but then people started hating on him because they consider him as the cause of their misery.

And then came covid, and everything went south, economically, but also politically. Not gonna enter into details, but covid forced a lot of people to close their businesses, the government committed mistake after mistake and scandals were breaking every week, one of the biggest scandals was the government members went on holidays in a hotel, while covid was hitting hard, and hospitals were at full capacity and hundreds of people were dying every day, and photos of the ministers bathing were leaked, and we still couldn't get any vaccine from any brand. That led to massive protests, and the president, with the support of the military decided to overthrow the government and dissolve the parliament. Starting from there, all the blame was put on the past 10 years of corruption and political schemes.

3 years later, Tunisia is still suffering from economic crisis, some first necessity goods are scarce, unemployment is still high, poverty is higher, prices are high, public services are shit... So whenever you speak to a common Tunisian about the revolution and Mohamed Bouazizi, it is like rubbing salt on their wounds.

Not all Tunisians are like that, and some consider that the revolution actually uncovered what was wrong in Tunisia, that was hidden by the government,. They believe that democracy and fighting corruption and granting the people its basic human rights and freedoms are worth the fight and the effort, and it is a whole process that does not happen in a blink of an eye. But some of these are in prison today, because the current president turned out to be a crazy populist dictator who took advantage of the fragile democratic system that was in place and got elected president, but then put an end the democratic transition and started his propaganda against all those who are criticizing him and his government.",,,,2024-02-06 12:51:49

I'm an 18-year-old Tunisian high school student who's been noticing many symptoms that are greatly present in both ADHD and depression (mainly memory, processing speed, and attention issues).

Since I'm in the mathematics branch, I feel like these might be greatly affecting my academic performance because this branch depends so much on the aforementioned cognitive abilities (especially working memory and attention). I'm afraid that this could lead to a bad performance in the Bac exam next year.

I don't want to use these disorders as an excuse, so I want to deal with them now and focus on my studies without feeling continuously worried deep inside.

At first, I thought the process is as straight-forward as it is in other countries. However, I remember seeing someone discussing a similar case on this subreddit a while back. And while I don't recall the details extremely clearly, something like ""Tunisians don't believe in ADHD and depression"" was said. Furthermore, so many things are different in the healthcare system of Tunisia compared to other counties. As a result, I don't know the exact process to get myself assessed, diagnosed, and treated in this country.

So, how do you approach these two conditions in Tunisia? Where do you go? How much does each assessment cost? How much do the medications for each condition cost? How long would it take?

Also, if there are multiple possible options for these questions, please list them. I want to go down a path that doesn't financially drain my parents, because I feel bad for them as they're already paying too much for my studies and I don't want them to pay much more.","I've went through depression last year(I had the whole starter pack, fat for the first time in my life,bad grades(12/13 etc) for someone who was had a 15/20 score just the previous year, suicidal thoughts)

Hii!!  Recently, I decided to check out my own digital footprints using a website. Things took a wild turn when, amidst my search, I stumbled upon 3 explicit videos with my name in the title (and ""tunisienne"" in French). it wasn't me, just some random video. 

But here's the kicker, I discovered that my images were being used by AI generators to create fake naked pictures. Even though I couldn't find the AI generated pics, the moment a fake profile sent me one, a swarm of guys started following my Insta. 

Now, my concern is, could all this jeopardize my chances in professional careers and securing a job in the future?  Any insights or similar experiences would be appreciated!","Maybe It’s a scam site: after you put ur name a lil bot search for your social and uses some of ur images to create some nudes or porn, they can host them in diffrent sites and give them random dates to make it believable, the unusual insta followers means that someone got ur instagram and probably they will try to threaten you (i say this because a similar thing happened to me - i used to have a website and got spammed by emails saying we caught you on vid masturbating after we hacked ur email and u need to pay €€€ for us to delete it or we will send it to all ur fb friends- ofc they didn’t had shit, they do this to as many people they can and focus on whoever responds) to think that they can generate something like that with simple images is disturbing.

My advice is lock your instagram and use the new filter fake accounts feature or better just delete it and don’t respond to any people u don’t know

With all that, it’s just a theory, please provide the website url, people are opportunistic and do dumb shit but in this age where porn & AI is just there i don’t think it will hurt ur future, stay safe and be carefully of where you put ur infomation",What’s the website ?,"As long as it doesn't show up on the first page of à Google search I think you'll be fine I guess.

TLDR: Lets have a discussion about life in the west (elbarra in general) dispell the myth of nidam and 9announ (or if you are still somehow drinking the koolaide tell us why lol). 


I will start. Location: Canada


- life is very expensive here. 60% of your salary goes to taxes. Unless you spend a lot of money on food to get organic food (thats worse than fruit and veg at Halfaween that costs 0.7 millim) you eat crappy full of pesticide and hormones food that will make you sick. (Had an operation to remove an organ because of this looool. No not in Canada fi Touness 7md. I went to the doctor in canada and they didnt catch it (eventhough it was impossible to miss because of how advanced it was) either because the doctor was incompetent or they didnt mention it coz they wouldnt make enough money off me.))  


- on the medical side. You cannot meet a doctor. Because there are no doctors. If you do find a doctor they will talk to you for 5 seconds and sell you american toxic medicine.

- if you are middle class (somehow maybe after 30years of toilling here) you are mb 3 to 6 months away from absolute destitution if you miss your mortgage or credit card payements. This is because of how their system works. North americans are one of the most indebted ppl on earth. For every dollar they own, they spend 5$ of debt. If you dont get a credit card you cant do shit here. 

- its very normal to step over homeless ppl actively dying on the street in the most expensive high streets while going to your very important job or buying the latest toy for your kid. I have seen scenes where the-perfect-family is out shopping for toys for their kid on Christmas day actively step over a dying man (it was -25 C). The streets were decorated right out of a christmas movie until you saw the homeless man dying of cold that no one gave a fuck about. Now if he had a dog they would have ""rescued"" the dog and spit on the man. (As I am writing this, I passed a woman with her baby totleb in the subway station. Its -3 C outside and by law a police officer will kick her out or put her in prison for loitering and take away her child. )

- now in canada, they are very ""polite"" in the sense they are rarely vitriolic in their racism (compaed to europe) unless you dont act super grateful to be breathing western air OR you mention a flaw they have OR WORSE you are somehow against genocide??? ( yes in that case prepare to be harassed fired from your job and thats if you avoid being defamed in the media). Also  if you think you are ""non white canadian"" and happen to be in a war zone they will get you out? LOLOLOLOL. lookup canadians of convenience. During the 2006 lebanese war (invasion by z**p*gs) when can gov discovered that 20k lebanese canadian citizens were in lebanon at the time and they had to evacuate them according to canadian law. They just called them profiteers of canada and revoked their citizenships and that of their kids! 

Chouf I am not saying Touness is jannah or that it is not going downhill. However alhamdullah we are an arab/muslim country not being bombed, do you know how rare that is (Yemen Syria Iraq Palestine Libya Afghanistan Lebanon Palestine Sudan Mali ...). Get what you need, come back and build your life back home. 70% of our problems comes from incompetent fucks detached from reality who are running idarat. They are small time tyrants ready to sell the country to the first shady westerner who comes for 5 francs. We shouldn't let these mo5t essentially chase us out of our country so we can toil in 8orba in perpetuity while they live the high life back in Touness. 

I didn't say uproot your entire life overnight but plan your move back home. Give it the proper due like you did for immigration. Align your cards before you take the jump and you will have the best of both worlds. I think most of you should have seen the writing on the wall by now. The west is going downhill. If you intend to raise your kids here, you are taking a major risk to fuck up your life. I pity you but I mostly pity your kids and what they will go through. 

Ask yourself is tavyiss on your old high school/university friends/extended family once a year worth it when you have seen your mom 5 times in the last 10 years?

Is toilling away at your job like a dog when your kids are learning about all kinds of degenrate shit at school worth it? 


Think about this. ","Certainly, here's a refined version of your ideas:

Life boils down to choices, and having the privilege of holding a Canadian passport means having the freedom to live wherever one desires. Despite Canada having its drawbacks, they pale in comparison to the challenges faced in Tunisia, where even simple tasks become unbearable.

For medical care, I prefer seeking treatment in Tunisia, but when it comes to financial matters, debt is a common burden in both countries. While I have a mortgage, I'm confident I can manage it over time.

Living in the Montreal suburbs, I'm grateful for the peace of mind I have here. Unlike in Tunisia, I've never experienced unwarranted encounters with law enforcement.

With family ties severed after my mother's passing, I feel less anchored to Tunisia. Its flaws have become deal-breakers for me.

In Canada, I enjoy the convenience of handling banking and transit through my phone, dining at diverse restaurants, and traveling globally without currency restrictions. The safety of parking my car without worry, efficient online shopping, and avoiding long queues for basic necessities are luxuries I cherish.

Despite facing challenges such as homelessness, selfishness, and racism everywhere, I've managed to launch two startups from the comfort of my computer desk. Overall, Canada provides a more conducive environment for both personal and professional growth.

As the title suggests, I find myself in an unfortunate situation where I have to give up my cats for adoption so I may have a better chance at dealing with much more pressing matters. It is only getting harder for me to have them around, and as much as I love them, a decline in mental health and financial stressors have led me to this decision.

They are three 8 year old tabby cats, male. They're in good health, and have had yearly checkups at the veterinary. 
It is important to mention that they have not been neutered.

I made contact with ""SOS Animaux Tunisie"" and the ""Association de Protection des Animaux Tunisie"" concerning the matter, but they were unable to assist.

Please, I do not seek health or caretaking advice for my cats. I am looking for a safe place where I can leave them to receive the care they need. 
It goes without saying that if someone here is able and willing to adopt even one of my cats, we can arrange it in DMs, and I would be grateful.
Otherwise, if any sort of help or guidance can be provided, it would be immensely appreciated as well.

Hey y'all

We are a brand-new rock band out of Miami Beach, Florida. Our studio album features members of Pearl Jam, Agent Fresco, and New Found Glory. We are excited to start our tour in the Summer of 2024 and are looking at potential destinations.

We are trying to find cool venues, something like an old church or an old theater, with seating capacity from 50-150 guests. An old abandoned building, barn, field, or cemetery would also be cool, if available. We’d like to make a documentary about the tour, so we prefer cinematic places over traditional rock clubs.

It's hard to do this kind of search on google, so I figured it's best to ask here, since I will be doing the majority of planning for the tour.

One last thing, if you guys have any recs on local poster artists, please tag their IG's or names. Food and off-the-beaten track sites are also much appreciated. Especially places pertaining to local music history.

Hope to hear some great suggestions, and thank you in advance,

Mad respect for you, really, if you start a change in this specific sector, I can assure you, you'll be a Tunisian hero.

Also, I totally agree with you point. 

Last summer I was amazed by the beach in Bizerte but was totally shocked when I saw a huge plastic empty pack of ""Croustina"" in the water.. Complete disaster.. 

I mean, my first thought was, at least if you're going to litter, AT THE VERY LEAST, go throw it in the land (where at least someone can pick it up and put it in the trash if you're that arrogant). If you're that ignorant and you absolutely need to throw it out recklessly, why would you do it in the water.. 

But then I picked it up, and I swear I didn't have to walk 10 meters out of the water to find a trash bin.. IT WAS RIGHT THERE.. Literally it would have taken less than 5 seconds to throw it and get back.. And this is what I don't understand, its that its really low effort, but such a huge reward..

My only advice for you is that if you want to approach this problem, I would advise doing some sort of ""حملات تحسيسية"" to educate people on pollution and its terrible consequences.

About big companies, I don't know how the legal systems works here, but I do advise you to be cautious, these companies might be corrupted and could get you in trouble so just be cautious.

Again, good luck on this, you're doing great things for our country, and please feel free to share your journey with us, I would really wanna know how this situation is going to evolve.","I've been living in Rades and I saw its beach gradually transform from a clean, cozy, familial summer destination to an unswimmable and an unapproachable radioactive pile of mud. 
The whole coast to Soliman has been corrupted. 


This subject has always infuriated me. We can do better. We're not even doing the bare minimum as a half conscious consumer nation.
Please carry on your noble work and keep is updated. ","Firstly, it is crucial to address the root cause of pollution, which often originates from human activities. In our country, evaluating the community's attitude toward environmental cleanliness is paramount. Culturally, there exists a strong emphasis on cleanliness due to adherence to religious doctrines. However, in practice, the country tends to operate more secularly, despite frequently invoking religious principles without substantive backing. This inconsistency is concerning, as it often leads to superficial judgments and blame-shifting rather than genuine religious conduct.

It's noteworthy that religious individuals often prioritize personal conduct and seek to impose their beliefs on others, rather than working towards broader societal benefits that don't infringe on individual autonomy. While religious principles can indeed inspire positive change, the focus tends to be on individual actions rather than systemic improvements that benefit the masses without encroaching on personal freedoms.

Moving beyond cultural considerations, the legal framework for addressing pollution exists. However, the effectiveness of these laws is undermined by inadequate enforcement mechanisms. While there are agencies responsible for monitoring environmental conduct, their actions often fall short of making a significant impact. Furthermore, instances of corruption within these agencies exacerbate the issue, with enforcement efforts often targeting small businesses for monetary gain through bribery rather than prioritizing meaningful environmental protection.

Addressing these challenges requires multifaceted approaches. Stricter environmental laws may be necessary to provide a robust legal framework for enforcement. Additionally, systemic changes in monitoring and enforcement procedures are essential to ensure that these laws are effectively implemented. However, perhaps most crucially, there must be a cultural shift towards greater adherence to environmental laws and principles. This requires education, awareness campaigns, and community engagement to instill a genuine commitment to environmental stewardship among the populace.

In summary, tackling environmental challenges necessitates a comprehensive approach that encompasses legal, systemic, and cultural dimensions. By addressing these factors in tandem, meaningful progress towards a cleaner and healthier environment can be achieved, while respecting individual autonomy and promoting systemic change over personal imposition.",can you share some photos or videos you have taken along your research?,"You should contact APEK (association fi ksibet el mediouni). I think they have a study done by international NGO about the pollution there. I'm not 100% sure about that, but it's worth a shot. Maybe it will help you.",2024-02-08 10:06:08

I've always been more adept with English to begin with, and hardly see myself succeeding to retain a career in advocacy there. I don't even necessarily wish to sit for the national test and pursue it as a profession in Tunisia (I mention this because Tunisian lawyers could become licenced to work in France with the right conditions being met), and I had my mind on other national tests that have better prospects for English speakers.

I really wish for a future between us, and we're too compatible together to let him go, but we both seem reluctant to relocate. And I'm not sure if I should keep up this tug of silly expectations if we're both going to end up heart broken by the end of it.","Let me summarize :
* You haven’t graduated yet;
* You dislike France because you don’t master french;
* You believe you can’t have decent jobs there;
* You don’t believe jobs in Tunisia are appealing;
* You don’t want to be financially dependent on your fiancé;
* Your fiancé would lose high pay if he joins you in Tunisia;
* You want this man, because he’s the one feel most compatible with.

* You either need to learn to like France and improve your french, get decent jobs there and have happy life with both of you working;

* He comes to continue his career in Tunisia, accepting the income cuts, and taking the risk, you won’t work and you still be dependent on him;

Striking a balance between personal happiness and the dynamics of the relationship is paramount.

Moreover, adopting a pragmatic perspective is crucial when evaluating the situation. By setting aside emotional biases and considering the potential outcomes objectively, one can better assess the compatibility of choices with long-term goals and values.  
I can't give you a clear answer but maybe a different perspective helps , it comes down to your personal evaluation of your priorities.

1amvohk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1amvohk/tunisian_doctors_vs_western_doctors/,0,Tunisian doctors vs ‘western’ doctors,"السلام عليكم


For context, i’m tunisian but born and raised in a european country as a second generation migrant. So my knowledge of tunisian society comes from what my parents tell me and the few weeks i spend there yearly. I myself am a medical student so that expains my interest in the following:


I noticed in this sub that the idea that tunisian doctors are better/more trustworthy etc. than doctors in the west. However, from what i hear and noticed is that the tunisian medical system is a mess. I noticed that most healthcare (if you have the money) is done in private clinics which says a lot about the health institutes in the country. But apart from the health care system, i noticed that doctors in tunisia prescribe medication for everything. Like when i see my grandfather going to the doctor with a headache he comes home with a bag full of different medication, which is (at least from my perspective) an awful way of practicing. Antibiotics fly over the counter like it’s nothing aswell. 


My latest exprience is when my grandmother got diagnosed with cancer and just the way that was handled was mind blowing to me. First of all she got a colectomie, so now a stoma without her consent or knowledge????? all her decisions were made by my family while mentally she is very clear. For a doctor to allow that is crazy to me. But also the post operative care was weird, with doctors prescribing antibiotics for a non existing infections only for another doctor to stop that treatment a day later.


My point is, from my perspective the tunisian health system is not even comparable with a western (or at least european) one. So my question is, where does this idea come from?","seems to me like you're judging a whole system based on your personal expierience , granted it has its flaws  but the two main points are we don't have to wait ages to get an appointement and we have free health care.  also you may misinterpreted their point the genaral consensus is that we have as competent doctors if not better given the right conditions but they get crushed into an archaic system. i agree with you people go crazy with anticiotics here but again if you have a bacterial infection and it's been a few days with fever and body aches what are you supposed to do","some time you have to perscribe anti biotics to prevent an infection

and i am computer guy who's father whas a nurse","As a foreigner who has lived here for a number of years I have some opinions:

1: Most hated difference is the power divide between doctor and patient. Tunisian doctors love their status. They rarely explain or help the patient understand. This is common not just in Healthcare here. They are the doctor I am the patient don't ask questions is the general mindset I've found. I hate it. American doctors help you understand what, why, how, and other options. They talk to you like a normal person. There is generally no power divide.

2. Healthcare price compared to quality is surprisingly cheap here. You can get Lasik here on both eyes at a private clinic for around 2k tnd. Crazy cheap and from what I hear and know from others very well done. Generally compared to America everything here is 100x cheaper. 

3. You are right antibiotics are given here crazy easy however I also see this natural is better bs here as well. When I go to the dr/pharmacy I want stuff that actually works not stuff that's considered better because it's more natural. What I usually do is research the drug name I want and take that into a pharmacy and say ""give me this""

4. My wife had a miscarriage here. We had to carry our dead son in a plastic white container down the street to the lab so he could be tested on why it happened. It's been a few years now but we're still affected by that experience. In America the hospital would take care of all that so the family would be spared any more trauma then they already had. The whole bedside manner from the dr and the entire team was very lacking in supportive and encouraging words/deeds. It made us switch Dr's for our next baby and we have further decided we'd rather eat the cost of going to America for our next birth then have another here. 

I probably have a few more but this is what I remember now.","People have the notion that tunisian doctors are of higher quality for 2 reason:
Reason 1: medical studies are very hard and last for like 7 years
Reason 2: You’d need like 18,00+ in baccalaureate to get admission in medical studies and people who can’t reach that score go study abroad in countries with looser admission requirements like Morocco, Russia..
And thing is the requirements for medical studies are so high in Tunisia because it’s saturated basically in Tunisian culture if your parents can afford feeding and housing you in your twenties while you get free education you are expected since childhood to either be a doctor or engineer","From my experience:

I want to know of some tips i should follow to avoid getting into legal issues during this temporary starting phase where i am working undeclared, particularly when dealing with my bank, if i regularly deposit different amounts of money into my checking account, will that raise any suspicions or make them question where i am getting that money from? or freezing my account until i provide invoices or other proof of funds which i don't currently have? should i avoid wire transfers from foreign banks to my local bank account in case i have a foreign client?

&#x200B;

I am thinking about travelling to Tunisia from the 15th until the 20th of March with a friend of mine which happens to be through Ramadan. We have both never been to Tunisia before and in general to Muslim countries through this festive period. I would be thankful if you could help me - is it worth it travelling to Tunisia at this time, are there enough things to do and restaurants to eat at? We are looking to stay around the Tunis/Carthage area. Thank you in advance! :)",Tunisia is mostly asleep during Ramadan. A lot of businesses and food places would be closed and the streets will be empty at night especially during the first half (though you could enjoy some cultural activities in the old town and more lively streets in the second half). You'd better wait after the end of Ramadan (April 10th) and the weather will be also better in April.,If you’re willing to live the Ramadan lifestyle then yes. I mean everything is closed and most businesses and restaurants open at night.,"Not recommended, the country is in its most boring of states in ramadan.

50% if not more of fast food places shutdown through the whole month, most events are religious, everybody pretending alcohol is suddenly a taboo, no bars or hotels are booking fun shit just cause ramadan and 100% of businesses that do open through Ramadan open late.

If you're fine with seeing Tunisia in a boring state then you will have no issues.","Don't do it, your vacation will be hell. People won't work, no bars etx
Most restaurants will only have Iftar service, basically à set menu at double the price.

wtf","Historically, every one had a superior except the king/bey himself, and every one had to suck up to his superior in order to keep his job, and to gain favors.

This was transferred to the Tunisian administration. Your boss has a boss who in turn has a boss up to the minister. Imagine that you as boss you want to make some illegal or unethical thing, nothing very harmful, just a favor for someone you know, or for yourself, you would need some trusties to make sure you don't get hurt and no one reports you. So you'll do them some favors, small things, to make them grateful, so when you ask for the favor back, they will do it. So some people catch that, and become themselves suck ups (ta7ana, 9aweda, la77assa) in order to get your favor.

Imagine that if you don't engage in that practice, to stay behind, you are left out, or your promotions are delayed. Imagine that if you actually report the corruption of your boss, every one turns against you, and you are the one who is sanctioned, because you betrayed the team, but mainly because if one goes down, they all go down.

Do you see the picture? This is how it is in Tunisian administration. And that's why people who report corruption end up being antagonized and threatened, so no one else reports anything anymore.",Because nobody Cares about this's country future anymore.,Because of UGTT.

1amjgcr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1amjgcr/psychiatristpsychologist_recommendation_in_nabeul/,3,Psychiatrist/psychologist recommendation in Nabeul,"I have been struggling with mental health issues for more than 5 years and in my case the denial phase was longer than average. Only recently when things got terribly bad that I started educating myself and labeling what am going through as ""mental health issues"" cause I used to hate the common misuse of this term -an easy excuse especially for manipulative people to justify being rude or weak or irresponsible.
That is probably one of the reasons why I didn't feel at ease when talking to the psychiatrist who diagnosed me with a severe seasonal depression and bipolar disorder (last year).

At a certain point when I was trying to assess the situation on my own, almost every syndrome or complex that I read about, I feel that it is relevant and I associate myself with it either as a whole or with some major symptoms.PTSD, shiny object syndrome, ADHD, psychosis, God complex, attachment issues, porn addiction ...
All of those issues in my head, I was afraid of looking weak and  my Doctor never helped me open up.
And that shit really bothered me cause I felt judged and I felt that I wasn't given enough time to be understood and authentically diagnosed.

And the cycle of doubt began: what if she just wants easy money (our sessions never lasted longer than 30 minutes) ? What if she is only good at being sexologist(that is the main line on her carte de visite) ? What if the fact that I didn't open up about my most serious issues would lead her to treat an issue that I don't have?- in the best case scenario it would treat an issue but definitely there are more issues bothering me-
But at that time I get over those thoughts by a simple thought: as long as I haven't killed myself, the treatment is effective.

3 months of going back and fourth, many lows and probably a sole  UP  no other than I somehow passed my last semester fel licence b 12 moyenne.
I've never expected it ! cause I've never felt so bad in my life and I have never felt so careless and I have never felt so indifferent about exams. 
It was a much needed sigh of relief, a reassuring ego-boost that I was desperate to get and I almost gave up on... 

I started feeling good.Meanwhile I went back to questioning the effeciveness of my doctor's treatment and I came to this conclusion
If I raise the level of my expectations just a little higher than not killing myself, then am having literally no progress at all.
So I quit my medication which was Vaincor and Teralithe.
+9 months have passed and I haven't had any complications worth mentioning and I haven't had another ""serious"" condition that raises to the level of ""depression"". 
I could have done the right choice to quit the meds and avoid developing a dependency and I could be wrong. 
Time will provide clarity as it always does.

As a preventative measure, I want to minimize the probability of a relapse.
I would love to adress my concerns to a specialist who would LISTEN to me and HELP ME OPEN UP EVEN IF I CHOKED 20 TIMES.
Also I don't wanna pay 70dt for 15 minutes 🤡

I would appreciate any interaction with this post (am sure it has another name on reddit but take it easy am still a newbie here xD)
Feel free to ask me about anything, and if you are going/went through a similair situation you can DM me anytime.
Have a great day beautiful people ❤️","Good morning, text me in private. I'd be happy to help",In your case you need some medication i'm afraid so going to a psychiatrist is not an option.

Ghali's performance at Sanremo was truly remarkable, delivering a powerful and thought-provoking message about the struggles faced by second-generation immigrants in Italy. His portrayal of navigating between his Italian and Tunisian identities. Not fully accepted as Italian citizens despite being born and raised in Italy, shedding light on the experiences of countless individuals in similar situations and helping them feel acknowledged and seen.

From his song ""Bayna,"" which blended Tunisian dialect and Italian (what i also appreciated is that this song touches on the subject of refugees, he donated a lifeboat of the same name to the Mediterranea association, and is supporting migrant rescue efforts in the Mediterranean Sea)  to ""Cara Italia,"" his performance captured the journey of finding belonging in a country that is both home and yet, at times, unwelcoming. His rendition of ""L'Italiano"" by Toto Cutugno affirming his identity as a true Italian. 

In just five minutes, he encapsulated years of challenges, biases, aspirations, and self-discovery. 

And also before the finale he performed his new song ""casa mia"" wich touches on the genocide happening in gaza and showed up wearing a koufiya

I also like that the writer alternates between fast and slow pacing events but I hate long speeches and long flashbacks. Also subtle details about characters, their facial and body expressions reflect a lot of hidden meanings.

But I also love the classics especially Zola in French and Naguib Mahfouz in Arabic, and Magic realism like Murakami. I also read historical novels and I never reject a good social satire. 

I think Arabic sci-fi and fantasy is getting a revival with the new generation of writers, including in Tunisia, that's why I read a lot of Tunisian books lately (the editor Pop Libris is doing a good job at encouraging these genres).

I have a few friends living abroad where postal services are likely better, but they are returning to Tunisia more than 3 months before my departure. (JR Passes must be activated within 3 months of the issue date... Japanese stuff.)

Yesterday, I had an experience that confirmed the concerns raised in my previous post. While waiting in my parked car for a friend before heading to the gym, a police car approached, with one officer in civilian clothing. Initially, he requested my ID card, and I assumed it was a routine check. However, he then asked me to exit the vehicle and proceeded to search it without showing a permission to search it. Throughout the encounter, he questioned me about my destination and exhibited a confrontational tone.

I cooperated and explained that everything was in order, but the officer seemed to have a suspicion and dropped some stuff from the car while searching it. I requested him not to disrupt the car. Eventually, they left after almost  10 minutes of searching, and when I questioned the officer about the intrusive search, he claimed that the area (Menzah) was suspected of drug activity. I questioned whether I appeared to be a suspect, to which he replied that he was simply doing his job—(randomly searching people's cars in the hope of finding drugs for potential negotiation rather than taking the matter to the police station).","I mean, our law enforcement is a joke, there’s no debate on that front. 

Dropping your belongings from the car and their unnecessarily rude/ confrontational tone and behavior is uncalled for 100%. 

However, this isn’t the US where they need to show you a warrant or explain why they did what they did. Reasonable suspicion is decided at their own discretion they don’t owe you an explanation. 

Random young man chilling in a parked car? Potential drug operation => a search is in order. 

Their actions are rude, illogical *(imo that’s not enough to conduct a search but again my opinion is irrelevant)* but not unlawful, I don’t think you faced any injustices here. 

Glad the interaction stopped at that.",To be honest dont argue with them yes i know they assholes( tayechlehom leklem )but dont start a whole argument with them because at the end of day u cant touch them by law so your losing,"> he claimed that the area (Menzah) was suspected of drug activity.

Which translation is the best?","So, I am trying to translate ""development model"" after listening to a discussion in Tunisian media about "" تنمية "" in Tunisia and the best model for it. It seems to be harder than I thought. "" تنمية "" is understood by me where the sense of the word is to increase and change from a wider perspective, especially into an innovative vacuum. Compare this to ""نُموّ"" which is about growth evolutionary, more according to a plan where the shear number becomes at focus like the number of cells or skills. But the hard part is the word model. Three words are here good candidates, all of them used in translations: (منوال), (نموذج) and (نمط).  (نمط) makes me thing of style and not model. (نموذج) makes me think of how things should be, made to copy, and therefore can be a good translation. (منوال) is like (نموذج), but without being exemplary in that things should be modeled according to it. Therefore, I would translate development model as ""نموذج تنموي"" or ""نموذجا للتنمية"". How do you guys see this? Do you have experience, maybe read something like an article where one of the translations is used?","In Tunisian media, development model is often referred as منوال التنمية/المنوال التنموي

&#x200B;

1- Do I have the right to stay silent ? In the street / fel markez  
2- Do I have the right to refuse a search of myself, my house, my car etc..? and what are the conditions?  
3- what happens if I refuse to id ?  
4- What should I do if I'm taken to a police office? If I'm innocent? If I'm guilty?  
5- Can I record police?  
6- What should/can I do if I'm physically or verbally attacked?  
7- Any additional advice ?

&#x200B;

If anyone has answers to the questions above, teb5elch 3lina yal 5ou","Never ever refuse to ID yourself, and make sure to record them without getting caught if you don't wanna end up as a human punching bag. 

Getting searched is subject to a lot of laws which will never EVER be enforced if you're not rich or have connections, since Tunisian judges happen to be even filthier animals than Tunisian cops. So just let them search if you got nothing to hide.

You got the right to stay silent, but that won't stop them for beating the crap out of you.

> 4- What should I do if I'm taken to a police office? If I'm innocent? If I'm guilty?

You should use street dog psychology on Tunisian cops. Be cooperative WITHOUT looking scared. Dogs can smell adrenaline and will try to intimidate you, so you shouldn't' sign on anything you didn't read without a lawyer",someone's gonna get slapped.,"5- During covid times, someone I know was taking a video from his house window of a police convoy driving slowly infront of his house and asking people to go home. They saw him, went up to his house and demanded him to delete the video, luckly he is in law too but he had to remove it.","1- Do I have the right to stay silent ? In the street / fel markez

Yes. But just be smart about it, don't be provocative, it makes the situation harder for you. If you are asked where are you going or where are you coming from, who is with you (if you are driving), stuff like that, just answer. You can lie, about it, he can't tell. If you are arrested, you have the right to remain silent, and all lawyers advise to remain silent before you talk to your lawyer. You can refuse to cooperate and it is completely legal. I would advise you to just let them know that you will not be answering any of their questions, until you meet your lawyer, and that's because you don't want to say the wrong thing and incriminate yourself unknowingly.

2- Do I have the right to refuse a search of myself, my house, my car etc..? and what are the conditions?

For your house, they need a warrant, so you can refuse unless they have a warrant, you can deny them access if they want to enter your house without a warrant, but don't fight them if they force their way, they can charge you with assault, just let them through, and file a lawsuit (there are some exceptions to this). For the car, your body, your phone, I am not sure, I would say yes because it is similar to a house search, don't take my word for it. But for your phone, avoid using bio-metrics to unlock it, they will force you to put your finger or use face id to unlock it. I use a pin number, if they ever ask me for it, or ask me to unlock my phone, I would just remain silent (question number 1)

3- what happens if I refuse to id ?

You can't refuse to Id yourself, that's illegal, so you will be probably arrested. 

4- What should I do if I'm taken to a police office? If I'm innocent? If I'm guilty?

Ask to call your family/lawyer, ask for a medical check up, ask for a lawyer. Other than that you remain silent until you talk to your lawyer. Whether innocent or guilty. Don't believe anything they say to you, doesn't matter if it is true or not. Don't cooperate. They just want you to confess, whether you did it or not. SO REMAIN SILENT

5- Can I record police?

It is illegal to record the police. you can try to do it without being caught, but it is illegal.

6- What should/can I do if I'm physically or verbally attacked?

Nothing. Get a lawyer and go directly to the Attorney General (وكيل الجمهورية) and file a lawsuit there.

7- Any additional advice ?

Just respect the law, and be courtois and respectful when dealing with the police, don't act provocative. 99% of the time they are just doing their job. In case you broke the law while driving, just follow their instructions and accept the fine. If they throw hints at you to give them a bribe just play dumb and say you don't have any cash on you. Also, if you can, don't carry cash with you, at least you will not be able physically to give them a bribe, even if you wanted to.",,2024-02-14 01:23:18

In theory, it means prices will increase in Tunisia because there's less supply and a bit cheaper globally because there's more supply.

In practice, nothing major will probably happen to prices because the fixed price olive oil thing was just a populism trick and the majority of olive oil was being sold at its market price. Globally, a little bit of an increase in Tunisian exports won't change prices much.

Good luck","You ask for a raise if you deserve one, otherwise you are a clown wasting his time.

If you're worthy, go for it. Start by thanking him for his time. Tell him that you want a pay rise for your proven performance, achievements and added value. You need to back up your claims with solid facts and evidence; words have no meaning.
Point out that you didn't get a pay rise last year, despite inflation, and that you would be grateful if he would consider your request.
If he is looking into it, ask when you can expect an answer: by the end of the week, by the end of the month. Etc.
Thank him again for his time.

There are many points to consider:

Annual increases are automatic if they are written into the contract, otherwise they do not exist.

You are not on good terms with your employer and he is not your friend. you are a disposable tool that is still of use.

Your employer's aim is to pay you less while making you do more. Your goal is to get more while doing less.

Because of inflation, your salary is worth less and your so-called friend is fine with it.

Know your value: a pawn is disposable. Losing the queen is a catastrophe.

You have not specified why you want a raise, because it has been over a year is not a valid argument. Your performance, contribution and added value should be the reason.

Is it a good idea to ask for a pay rise now? Is the situation favourable?

Does Tunisia really want to have high spending tourists?

For example:  
2 people, 1 week, 5 Star hotel, flights included from Munich/Germany

1100€ Tunisia --> [https://www.holidaycheck.de/hi/iberostar-selection-kantaoui-bay/0b8ec9ed-a0c9-3237-a14b-b527a9410187](https://www.holidaycheck.de/hi/iberostar-selection-kantaoui-bay/0b8ec9ed-a0c9-3237-a14b-b527a9410187)

1300€ Turkey --> [https://www.holidaycheck.de/hi/seaden-quality-resort-spa-ultra-all-inclusive/a7e74d59-c476-40ab-a221-fc463f3ec209](https://www.holidaycheck.de/hi/seaden-quality-resort-spa-ultra-all-inclusive/a7e74d59-c476-40ab-a221-fc463f3ec209)

Price difference is 200€.

I have good friends from Tunisia that I visited 4 times over the last years. I stayed at their place (Sousse, Monastir, Mahdia) not a hotel (I like it much more, you get to know the people/country). My friends have some contacts so sometimes we went to hotel beaches. The waiters were not very motivated and we had to wait a lot for drinks/food/service etc.  
The same at some restaurants (not all of course), even pricy ones like this in sousse (https://maps.app.goo.gl/SW5SoChbQ26W72788). Sometimes you sit at your table and have to wait for 10-20min until somebody comes, takes orders etc. If you dont give them signals the maybe never come idk. As a tourist I want to spend money but the seemed like the dont want to make buisness.

So why should a (high spending) german tourist come to Tunisia and not Turkey (great service, modern hotels)? Most tourists rather spend 200€ more and go to Turkey for example.

Tunisia has great food, culture, medias etc. but I dont really see the goal to attract high spending tourists.

PS: I really like the country and will come back this year to visit.



","Actually I think Tunisia should manage how tourists spend their money. Hotels are just a blackhole: they do not pay that much taxes, they do not pay their employees that well, they get benefits on water, electricity and subsidiary goods like flour, sugar, goods...

I think Tunisia should rather invest in transportation so that tourists could easily move in the country and actively contribute to the economy by interacting directly with the locals and not by staying in all inclusive hotel for two weeks.","> Sometimes you sit at your table and have to wait for 10-20min until somebody comes, takes orders etc. If you dont give them signals the maybe never come idk. 

This seems to be a misunderstanding since in a lot of restaurants in Tunisia if you don't call the waiter he may never come to you, of course they want customers why wouldn't they?

> So why should a (high spending) german tourist come to Tunisia and not Turkey (great service, modern hotels)? Most tourists rather spend 200€ more and go to Turkey for example. 

Tunisia is quite a different country, with a completely different culture, Tunisia is much smaller but you would find completely different climates, the Sahara in the south and vast forests in the north, completely different food, different and unique history in North Africa since it dates back to pre-Islamic era which gives it and Egypt an edge over the others.","Numbers provided might be misleading, same hotelsbut from 1/7 to 31/7 you get 1700€ for tunisia and 2600 for turkey flight included comparing in off season is not accurate",Tourism is a weak unreliable sector,"Whats the thought behind your post, want us to beg you to come to our country?!?!? Actually we dont want european tourists. Even the ""high spending one"" dont spend that much money. You come here, you spend less than your monthly rent to enjoy heavenly weather food and beaches and complain when you see tunisians around you. For good quality tourists who are respectful, spend the money and appreciate the culture its the Malaysians Chinese Algerians Libyans and Gulfies. I have seen semi homeless europeans coming to Tunisia enjoy a level of luxury and service they could never imagine in zerope. Your post also sounds mildly threatening and condescending. Like dont ""expect"" high quality tourists because we dont deserve them somehow. Well we dont need european tourists anyway because how much disposable income do you guys still have? Also watch your tone when literally your pensioners are living in Touness tax free since they would die in their hovels back there.

Also before visiting a psychotherapist i would have a short phone call with them to  inquire about their methods and procedures so i can be sure  they are actually what  they say they are not just a random person who had a personal development crash course and thinks he can cure people

Also let's look at this from a deeper perspective, i really hate it when ""foreigners"" come to the third world and start acting like they stumbled upon some cave men in north Africa,  waving his money around at their faces, the money that native people work diligently for. day and night.

On the other hand, look at how stunned he is from Tunisia's incredible beauty and culture. The vibes are immaculate and the city is full of life, a simple authentic life that brings true happiness. In the so called 1st world, their existence has got stale, people turned into working machines, a mere clog in the giant capitalist machine, shadows of their former selves. life isn't about amassing money, life is much more than that. And yet, we, Tunisians, we do not appreciate this virtue, we do all kinds of morbid stuff , littering, scamming each other, going to war with each other when we could be building our beautiful country like Singapore did. Tunisia is a fucking Gem of a country, we stand as the bridge that links Europe to Africa, that's HUUGE, but unfortunately, we still suffer from the forcefully fed inferiority complex, just watch po\*n, abuse drugs, scroll ur life away on TikTok and don't do anything productive for your country. i get extremely depressed when i hear about a young bright Tunisian thinking about leaving his beloved sunny country and go be a slave to the ""upper class"" of the globe. If you feel confused or didn't get my point, imagine a tunisian, or an arab do this in Los Angeles for example. it's impossible, why? aren't we all human beings? aren't we all born equal ? why can't we believe in ourselves. why does this guy have to treat us like monkeys in a zoo? but at the end of the day, God is the ultimate judge.","Unfortunately people will just do whatever it takes to get attention and views online. It's not a new thing either, people have been traveling for centuries now and flashing about to try to show off to locals. I guess it will only stop once the world equals out and there's less of a divide between nations in terms of wealth. 

However, it seems like you think you're only exploited by the bourgeoisie abroad? Tunisia has its own rich elites who destroy the country. The Western elites certainly help with this process, but most of the actual damage is done domestically by Tunisians who don't care about their fellow citizens and sell their country out.

> He even pronounced the letter "" ق "" in one of his vlogs. 

How does this have anything to do with his mother accent ? It's like saying someone can't be Egyptian because he pronounces the ""P"".

> furthermore, He keeps asking them question in English over and over again knowing damn well that no one of the people he encountered communicated good English. 

His questions seem to be standard and people seem to communicate with him pretty well. That aside, he is a vlogger, and interesting travel vlogs are those where you describe every single detail, or better, let the locals describe every single detail.

Honestly the dude's whole vibe is that of ""damn I am so excited to learn about this place, please tell me what this is called"" instead of ""hello cave men, here is some money"".","OP clueless about how many accents Americans have 😂

And pronouncing ق isn't a big deal. It's not that hard to learn how to pronounce a letter that u don't use in ur mother language.

I was looking into relocating into Tunisia for few months for a change.

I have lived all my life in Egypt -apart from occasionally staying abroad in USA and Europe for few months- and I believe it’s about time I move somewhere and experience life outside of Egypt, as the situation domestically is getting more dire but hopefully will the tides will turn. 

My main challenges would how much food/rent would cost and how does the financial system work (taxes basically) and how does the banking system work (opening a bank account in local currency and in USD if available as well as any monetary restrictions) 

If anyone could elaborate more on these topics would be highly appreciated and if anyone has any advice please feel free to share :) 

Thank you all in advance lovely people.",how did you receive the Tunisian citizenship?,"As a citizen with residency abroad you can open a bank account in both local and foreign currency. 

Depending what’s your academic background, Tunisia private sector is very competitive due to low supply and 90% of the jobs if not more will require you to know French. Do you? 

Assuming you freelance there is a “patente” (someone correct me if Im wrong) you need to apply to in order to work legally as a freelancer and taxes aren’t hard to figure out since there are calculators online you can use. More importantly, you have to also pay for CNSS, CNRPS (percentage) and CNAM (flat) and those are for the pension once you retire and the free or subsidized healthcare you will need. 

Food and rent are more expensive than Egypt but as a single person your budget should be around 1k tnd monthly for all your expenses and it will depend where are you planning to live.

I would advise to stay at your Tunisian family first to settle well first before you decide to start living on your own.","Food and rent heavily depend on your lifestyle and where you live. But it'd be a minimum of 800 TND, and will obviously increase depending on where you live.

As for taxes, it depends on what you do as a job. If you're gonna work in Tunisia, your company will pay your taxes for you. If you're gonna be self employed, there are different guidelines that I'm not too sure about.

For bank accounts, opening a local bank account is pretty easy. For USD, not entirely sure, but these things can be pretty complicated here.

Sorry that I'm not of much help 😅, but I'm also new here (2 years now). I also lived in Egypt my entire life + some time in Europe. If you're down, we could meet when you come. We should have a lot in common!","Bro, just go to the gym, work on urself, gain some confidence",,2024-02-17 14:23:58

people mistakenly believe that you can't change undemocratic people but look at Germany. The Weimar republic took pretty much the same course we did until they elected the Nazis mostly off the back of a lack of democratic culture in Germany that spent most of its history ruled by absolute monarchies.

the economy should tax the shit out of rich people and tax common people less and provide education, health and security. it should build up good public transport and infrastructure, it should work towards nuclear power, its police should be VERY well trained and require some kind of law degree. this should give us less corrupt cops as the standards will be higher and those that don't cut it will instead go to the military.

the government's social policy should be based on the idea of consent. LGBT should be legalized, deradicalization and secularization efforts should be undertaken, weed should be legalized and HEAVILY regulated and taxed along with a few other drugs. drugs are actually an untapped resource as most countries don't experiment with them cause they're illegal so literally every country on the planet right now has a potential monopoly on new discoveries and their applications if they just subsidize research on them.

&#x200B;

I hope you are all doing well. I am reaching out to express my need for help. Currently, I am actively seeking an internship in either web development or data analysis. I hold a bachelor's degree in computer science and am currently pursuing a second bachelor's in business computing.

The situation is a bit complicated but stay with me. Previously, I had the opportunity to intern at a small company specializing in the sale of dental equipment and products for dentists where I was involved in the design and development of a dental office management website and online appointment scheduling, and right after I graduated I started working there. 

Although I was enthusiastic about further developing the project, it unfortunately did not progress as expected due to marketing challenges faced by the company.

As the project lost momentum, my responsibilities shifted away from my field of expertise. Despite this, I remained committed to the opportunity for professional growth. 

But tbh, I didn't accept the position for the pay (because it wasn't even near half of what the market expectations for this position), but rather for the opportunity to develop the project more and see it grow. Unfortunately, that expectation wasn't met. The working conditions were far from ideal, I found myself working alone as a junior developer without any guidance, mentoring, and clear direction for the project's trajectory. 

I even did the research on what the project required and what it should deliver, the lack of support made progress difficult

&#x200B;

I am now actively seeking an internship where I can leverage my previous experiences and skills. I am eager to contribute to a dynamic team environment and continue my learning journey in a supportive and structured setting.

If you have any internship opportunities available or know of any leads, I would greatly appreciate your assistance. Please feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you for your time and consideration.",,,,,,2024-02-20 00:23:53

You wear what you want and what makes you happy/comfortable. It you feel that skirts and dresses show too much skin/ are too feminine for you, don't force yourself. 

On another level, unfortunately, you can be harassed even when you are wearing a niqab. So I get the concept that you dress in a way to protect yourself, but don't let it stop you for wearing what you want.

What I suggest is fripex, try to buy different skirts, dresses in different shapes, and sizes( depending on your style). That way you can try them without spending too much money. Seing what is actually trending in boutiques may not encourage you, so maybe finding something more unique in Fripe can be the solution.","> it just doesnt feel right and now i am even more concerned about it but dont know where to start or what to do cuz i dont even have a dress tbw and im too scared to buy one and not suit me.

Don't be concerned about it if u feel comfortable with hoodies n jeans/pants it's okay there's nothing wrong with that n u are not less feminine n ud need ppls' approval.

For instance, I never wore/wear skirts n id like them at all (my family always says that i am boyish 😅) n that's okay but i do wear dresses on events/weddings n usually i wear suits, but in my daily life i wear sporty n sometimes casual so u should not care about anyone except ur own comfort n how to reflect ur personal taste n embrace ur authenticity.

> I tried to justify this by living in our country which will harass most girls who wear dress or skirt...but i dont know..

If u want to change ur wardrobe n style u can start wearing dresses on ur daily life if u want to, people esp men will always harass n eroticize/objectify girls/women (whether u're wearing a dress or even veiled) esp in rural areas so just ignore them u live in tunisia not saudi arabia.

however, id recommend u to do so if u take public transport **everyday** (like bus, metro, na9l etc) our public transport sucks n u never know when some pervert(s) will jump out of nowhere n try not to walk in empty uncrowded places alone, if u have private transport u're safer.",It's totally fine as a female myself.

Taxi fares in Tunisia are regulated, with an initial charge of 0.9 TND and a subsequent charge of 0.6 TND  per kilometer. Additionally, there is a modest hourly rate of 0.15 TND per minute, which becomes evident, especially during congested traffic periods. From 9 pm to 5 am, fares experience a 50% increase. Furthermore, there is a 1 TND supplement for luggage and parcels, although this may not always be included. Departing from Tunis Airport incurs an additional charge of 4.5 TND . Using this info, you can estimate the cost of your journey by obtaining a distance estimate from Google Maps


>Tunis airport to sidi bou said (after midnight) 
Use the above formula with the 50% supplement and +4.5 airport extra fee

>Sidi bou said to Hammamet 
 Maybe taxi to ""Moncef bey station"" then the famous ""louage"" to hammamet ?

People aren't worth it. The majority of your friends won't be your friends after the BAC. I'm not pessimistic. One or two will remain. Maybe three or 4 but generally less. So, fuck being cool. Just study as efficiently as you can.

Don't underestimate English/French. They're very helpful.

As i am still neutral and i want to view more opinions to decide. ","We vote for politicians to improve the country's situation and develop it.

Let's observe the current situation under KS rule:

> Economics:

> - Stagnation (0.4% growth in 2023) + inflation + unemployment + increasing debts + low credit rating (Fitch and Moodys) + increasing taxes + considerable reducation in public investments + inadequately big state budget + random shortages touching some products (local production is doing down simultanously with reduction in imports) + serious agricultural decline + small and medium entreprizes dying in a serious rate

> Politics:

> - serious democratic backsliding, major concentration of powers in the presidency and no checks or balances, weak state institutions, endangered judicial independence (the minister of justice under presidential orders is meddling in the judiciary), arbitrary political regime with unclear prerogatives, growing restrictions on freedoms, extreme populism + conspiract theorists + paranoia (you are either pro-president or a traitor to the people), growing diplomatic isolation, opposition leaders in jail for malicious charges, restrictions on media and civil society, journalists in prison...

I know that in France you can't take a regular housing loan from regular french banks to buy a home outside of France, but you can get a personal loan but the down side is that it is a lower budget and higher interest rates may be.

There is another solution, and you have to check with those banks, Tunisian banks that have foreign branches like [Attijari](https://www.attijariwafabank.com/fr/besoin/financer-vos-projets-immobiliers) (I know it is not Tunisian, but it is active in Tunisia) or may be [BIAT](https://www.biatfrance.com/content/investissement-en-tunisie). I don't know if [TFB](https://tfbank.fr/credit-logement-en-tunisie-2/) is still in business. Those the one I know who exist in France. But I don't know if you are in France or not.

For feedbacks, my brother and his wife (both doctors at hospitals) went to TFB when they wanted to buy an apartment in Tunis, but their application was rejected because their contracts were ""CDD"" and not ""CDI"" which is stupid because that's how hospitals work in France. Rates at the time were low compared to now, but I think that they are within the normal bandwidth of rates of regular housing loans (TFB says it's euribor + 2, which corresponds to the regular rates). My brother end up taking a personal loan from his bank (societe generale) around 100k (50k per person) over 8 years.","Even if possible, I don't recommend it, there's been a serious bubble for the past few years and the market can crash at any moment (afaik)","I took a loan in Tunisia and I am living abroad. not a 100% sure about the rate, honestly I didn’t care, I was getting a very nice apartment at a huge discount to begin with.

Even if i dont i’ll just go to military in hopes of dying in war. Please tell me is there a solution to my problems ?","Don't stop going to school. You don't have many opportunities at your age ( I am assuming you are under 18). For your psychological issues, go to the school's administration and seek help, they should provide follow up. Don't give up this early. Life will not go easy on you if you don't have a solid background. Luck strikes very rarely, so don't count on it. try to find  a group of students in your class that can help you study, may be that's all you need, getting motivation by being in a group. It helped me a lot when I was a student, I failed my first year in university, so started studying in groups, and it turned out to be my thing, I found my motivation there.

It is not too late, and it's okay if you fail a year, just don't let it demotivate you

Good luck","I would suggest that you don't drop out :

Reason number one : You will judged by your level of education in any public administration.

Reason number two : School won't teach you anything about how the real life is but it will teach you how to learn which is a skill that you need.

Reason number three : You can both go to school and do anything you want in your free time and you don't need good marks to get through your school life.

Reason number four : Think of the joy you will give to your family once you finish university.

Reason number five : Higher education = High respect from goverment workers. 


Btw I wanted to drop out when i was 15 also now i'm 24 years old software engineer and now creating my own buisness , and i can tell you that higher education will help with getting investments or even suggesting your services to business,  the happiness i saw in my familys eyes when i got a good mark in pfe was priceless more than that the friends and people you will meet in university are next level compared to the ones you meet lycee or collège",Opt for a trade school they actually teach you things not that copy paste stuff,"First of all you need to address your mental issues. It's ok to open up to family, teachers or administration in school. 
Second I advise to get your bac then do whatever you want, be it university, trade school or starting a business. Hear me out on this, Ia family friend who s a very successful mechanic at 60 years old that built his own business from 0. I saw him cry uncontrollably from regret over not finishing school. He said it tormented him his whole adult life.","Studying is a skill you can master it like any other skill , if u dont have plans after leaving school dont leave it , ",2024-02-20 11:12:01
1avf44e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1avf44e/why_do_pioneer_schools_suck_so_much/,9,Why do pioneer schools suck so much,Being in a pioneer highschool : worst experience of my life.,hot take: the only thing these schools should be the place where students get their bac 1 or 2 years earlier bc of how boring the program is to prodigies. there are systems in america to make the most out of these kids and it would be nice to have a system to push them to their fullest potential instead of wasting it on standardized (slower pace) public education.,"As a veteran ""pilote"" student ..the only difference is the discipline of the pupils ..like u go n study there they have the same program same teachers same system but the students are just good at school so their level is pretty close ..they can have fun too n have clubs n events n other stuff but the issue is you have to mostly focus on studying ..the annual mark should me more than 12 or sometimes even 13 or you're out n this might cause some pressure n stress ..but over all the experience is good Im grateful for the 5 years I spent there and the great friends I made over those few years","Pilote is great for those kids whose entire nature is wired around the concept of performative achievement. They don’t work because they particularly enjoy the concept of working, but because they derive their entire sense of worth from the validation that adults heap onto them. They work because they’re scared of being outraced. That kind of grinder tier environment works because it gives them a consistent push to move forward when they don’t necessarily possess the kind of self sufficiency and autonomous drive that helps other students excel even in non pilote establishments. 
60% of pilote babbies burnout sometime between the 2nd high school grade and the bac. Those with more tenacious temperament could still overachieve well into uni, but the majority plateau into a baseline performance that is only a hair breadth above average (compared to what they might one day have perceived as their target “potential”). And granted, even that baseline is tiers above what the average person has, but I guarantee that the majority of Pilote babbies are unfulfilled, underwhelmed and probably disappointed.

But that’s just my opinion ","Pilote was awful for me, I hated it a lot. I have stories for days about it lol here’s one lol: 

I broke my hip in highschool and needed a wheelchair I mostly stayed home but exams came and I had to take them because the godless idara decided it’s not enough for me to miss the exams and I need to be there.

I said fine, bet, I’ll be there but I’m in a **wheelchair** so change the classes so we’d always be downstairs because *again* I’m in a **wheelchair** lols 

To their credit they changed most the classes downstairs albeit last second, but good enough for me I didn’t expect much accommodation tbh. 

Come time for the math exam no one notified the teacher so he’s upstairs, the students explained the situation and I kid you not, this power hungry nutcase told them ***I’m not moving bring her up***. I protested and told them leave me here and go take your exam but my friends insisted and carried me up. *AND* this fucking pathetic excuse of a human being yelled at us for being late. 


So yeah I don’t have much good to say about pilote, I did however meet the best people there, I formed lifelong friendships there. People with whom I still have daily contact even though we’re in different continents.",I'm grateful for my mother refusing to let me go to pilote twice when I had the right scores in both 6th and 9th grades.

On his way through the fields the bedroom philospher happened on a chicken coup that was fenced , from inside it he could see  a group of chicken huddled together whispering and laughing, the whispers were almost inaudible but the laughter and the cackling were so loud that the bedroom philospher was curious and quiet amused, and so he approached the chickens and asked them from behind the fence:  ""good day to you my dear chickens, could you possibly tell me,what is so funny?"", the chicken stopped talking and once they took a good look at the philosopher they smiled and cackled once more :""we know who you are! You are that pale man who isolates himself! Did you find truth yet?"" 

The philosopher smiled and sensing he is about to be given some lip, from these all too wise chickens that have laughed so heartily, relaxed himself ""no i did not dear chickens, have you perhaps anything to quench my pale hunger for truth?""

And thus spoke the chickens: 

Hunger? We know of no hunger

Nor is truth with the hungry

Hungry truth does not feed

The broken alone and painful

Is impotent with no seed

Thus his body cries, his skin pales

Upon the beauty and the delicious 

Horror strikes the body of the malicious

The greedy and ungrateful

Child to whom we smiled

Has turned the sail and fled the sun

To shadows and gloomy rooms

He locked his heart that had nothing to give

And how could he! for only we know how to give

Only we know how to feed

Only we know how to grow the seed

Had he came to us, we would have taught

But instead he preffered the company of the books

Of the friendless and the crooks

And so they should all rott !

&#x200B;

And we ever more glorious

Stand here victorious

For we know no hunger and no pain

nothing our mother does not soothe

she protects and she mends us sane

Our feathers are strong the cackling is loud

And the coop is home for many a warm egg

But you know of no warmth!

And thus you seek it!

But you shant find it, for your greedy soul is insatiable! 

Have you ever said enough? 

Have you ever had good sleep? 

Have you ever caught on to your own bluff? 

That you are no better, you are me

&#x200B;

The fathers and the mothers of the land

That built it with the reason and the hand

Stand to always know and understand

That we are all here under one house

Under one coup under one flag

if you doubt them you doubt yourself

and once you doubt yourself 

you are of no effective use

you are a dangerous leech

you signed up for our abuse

&#x200B;

We give love and honest work

And our deeds speak for us

When we die, our honest work

Will be there, the loved ones adore us

You however will die alone

For you breed no answer no truth

Only senseless questions and thus never atone

For the fact that you are of no use to this land

That fed and clothed you

lord ! what  a shame! 

You are a bedroom philosopher

A man with no name

The bedroom philosopher once having listened to the chickens,  smiled and bid them a good day, and as he resumed his walk he wondered, what chicken was going to be tomorrows lunch and whose egg somebody's breakfast, what fields did they speak of and love? As they were cooped behind that fence.. Truly he had even more questions now that they spoke to him.

Here are my favorite channels to learn from:
- Adam Ragusea
- Joshua Weissman
- Epicurious
- Ethan Chelbowski

For recipes, I recommend googling the name of whatever dish you wanna cook and following a recipe and then altering it based on ur taste and what you learned. Happy cooking!!",Make sure to buy a kitchen scale so you can follow recipes’ measurements.,2024-02-21 07:42:03

I once wanted to check a house mortgage, the price was 180mdt, over 20Y I need to repay 336mdt and ofc paying my 20% at the beginning (36 mdt)...nope fuck you and your fuckery.
